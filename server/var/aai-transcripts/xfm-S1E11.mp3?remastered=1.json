What do you mean it's fast approaching? What's it speeding up? Is it time speeding up as it gets towards 10 past 2? Shut up. Ricky Gervais, obviously. With him. Steve Merchant. Yeah. And Carl Pilkin. Let's not forget Carl P. The K man. He's growing on people now. People was thinking, oh, God, oh, he's too much now, going, they love him, like, same as you. I mean, they. They still think you talk a little bit too much. But, I mean, they love Carl and, you know, But I shouldn't say that because it, you know, it rock your confidence. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. No, I am a man of nerves. Sorry, I'm sidetracked because I'm looking on the Internet here on the website for xfm. Yeah. Because I was, well, partly bored, but also I was looking. Nothing I said, though, was it? No, no, no, no, no. And there were some people commenting on the show. Yeah. And one person on there. I'm trying to find it. I don't want to misquote them. Basically, as far as I remember, they said that we knew even less about the music than the DJs that are on in the week. Right. That's. I think that is scientifically impossible. Yeah. So they've embarrassed themselves. Exactly. I think it's impossible. You can't know less than the people. I don't think so. It's. It's just. I mean, like, I'm trying to multiply. Zero. You just end up with zero. It doesn't make sense. I checked with Steve Taylor, the man with the knowledge. He should know, but I pretty. I don't think that that's really annoying. It's so annoying, because I'll tell you this, we are passionate about the music and we do know what we're talking about. Just because we don't read the back of the CD box, the list we're. Given with the nine CDs that are on the playlist every month. There's a piece of paper here. The car's looking at me like he's thinking, oh, no, we're having a go. Giving away the magic. You get pieces of paper here and they've got little bits of details. So, for instance, white Stripes. This is the single off white blood cells, February 2002. Now it sounds like we know about the music. Yeah. That off a piece of paper. Exactly. Whereas when we say about music and we're wrong, at least we. It's because we didn't know. Exactly. See? All right, don't criticize us. Look at the All Stars. All the all Can. I just don't want to criticize that. If I was listening and I'd enjoyed that track and I wanted to know what it was, I wouldn't have understood what you just said. Really? Could you just say that again? Low fidelity All Stars. Yeah, Low fidelity. Because you went over there. I was doing all I was doing. Me, a dj. No, it's just. You didn't know. I can't be bothered. No, sure. It takes too much. Look at that. Listen to him cringling his little cringely cring. You're not crunchling. You're not cringling. Your Jaffa Cakes are. Yeah, he wasn't going out on air. No one knew. I bet you're one of those people in cinemas that think you're being really quiet, eating a bag of crisps. Anya, do you go to cinemas? I haven't been for a bit, actually. What do you do, Carl? Carl, what's an entertaining evening for you? Yeah. What would you do to occupy your time, Eh? Your hobbies, for instance. Might get a video out from prime time. Right. Would you enjoy that or would it just be a chore for you? No, no, I think things like that. Would you really hate doing that? That's when you really switch off and you forget all your problems and stuff. Why? You haven't got any problems. You haven't got any problem. You don't know that. I put on a face. When I'm with you, you wear a mask. Are you crying inside? This is you being the happiest you can be. You're like a clown, aren't you? Do you think I'm like a hard, miserable man because there was somebody else? I don't think you're hard. The other day and I said to him, I can't watch the Elephant man because it upsets. You're the best. You don't know you're doing it. You're the best. Can you watch it when it gets to that bit where they're carrying him through the village and messing about with his head? This is true. My dad watched that once. I watched it. My mum and my sister and that were all quite moved by it, almost thinking it was a wonderful example of man's inhumanity to man and all those things. And my dad just went, wouldn't he make an amazing novelty rucksack? And it cheapened the film for me. And I've never had this sort of. Steve was thinking, he's not that ugly. Blimey. We were laughing. Hey, Carl, can we focus on one person at a time? Rick, Destroy him first. Oh, God. Tell him what you said to me when that record was playing about the Jaffa. He bought some Jaffa Cakes, which is lovely. He went across the road and he handed out the Jaffa Cakes. And then I went, oh, thanks very much. And then. What did you say? I just remember learning at school, I'm not like making fun of the illness because it's not funny, but they cure cancer. Jaffa Cakes cure cancer. Not like fully. Right. They just go some way to helping. Yeah. Do you know, it'll sort of help if you've got it. You can't say, right, get me a load of Jaffa Cakes. Right. But I think it sort of puts a bit of a stop to it if you haven't got it. Do you know what I mean? It's like having vitamin tablets. Is this medically proven? Should we get Dr. Fox down here to confirm that? I can't. I actually can't cope. You're just. Play a record. Play a record. Can I just. If anyone has ever survived cancer, thanks to Jackie Cakes, please call in. No, but I think you'll say that. He said. And then he went, it's the orange thing in it. He read. He tried to read it. He said, I wonder if it's. And he tried to read out this tithing name. That's my favorite one I've ever done. It's great, isn't it? Yeah, really good. Yeah. Because I always had a problem with Gomez before because it always sounded like they were trying to sound like these world weary, Tom Waits style, gravelly voice. And they were 20 and they were like 14. Yeah, yeah. But I mean, that. That's great. That's really good. Yeah. Yeah. Well done, boys. Yeah, well done. Yeah. He gives it thumbs up. Oh, dear. Can I play an Elvis Costello track? You know, I'd love to bloody hear some Elvis Costello saying that. Well, you know why? Because we met him and he's a lovely man. We did meet him. Yeah. And I don't wish him to show off. I remembered all the great songs he's ever done. I didn't like his spoken word much too, you know, too much. And some of his later projects I thought were a little bit. But his own songs from, you know, 1978 to about 19, I thought were great. Why did we meet Him. I can't just remember why we met him, Rick. Oh, I wasn't. Well, I wasn't doing that. No, I can't remember. We won an award. Was it because we won another bloody award? Please. Oh, God. Oh, dear. We've only got two. Yeah. And we haven't got one of those. That one was the BBC, so he's got a lot of room in his house and I've got the other one. He let me have it. So he's got no award in his house at all. Can I. You can borrow it. Can. I don't know if you. I don't know who you're talking to. Someone. I spoke to Richard Wilson from One Foot in the Grave. I spoke to him. Yeah, but he's a lovely bloke. He didn't really know his go. But he said to me, he said, could you. Could I do a cameo in the office for Â£40,000? And I went, could, like, Ricky do, like, an amusing prattful or something? And then you just come in as a cleaner and go, I don't believe it. And he looked at me like. Like. Why have you said that? Why have you brought that? I felt so guilty. Oh, no. I so wanted to apologize. Why is it this. We know it's wrong. I don't know why I said it. We know. Do we think? No, it's different for me. Exactly. We're in the business. I'll do a new twist on I don't Believe it. And he'll go, you know, that's the best I don't believe it, Chris. I've ever heard. I don't know what I was thinking. Why did you. Oh, you didn't tell me that. I know. I felt ashamed. I felt really ashamed. No, I was a little bit drunk. I wasn't thinking straight. It was so embarrassing. I was talking to a friend of mine who said. Who was. He said that he was watching a new. It was. It was a sports cast, which. It may have been Formula one racing or something like that. And he was writing. There's a commentator and he's. You know, the commentators have got to keep talking all the time. Yeah. And he's going. And there's. There's the team there. Oh, good to see so and so's girlfriend anyone. And he said he saw that. It cut to Richard Wilson in the audience and he went. And the bloke went, and there's One Foot in the Grave. I love that he knew he had to say it there, but he couldn't just name all the characters. Oh, that's fantastic. One Foot In. Oh, dear. That'd be brilliant. And there's the Office. Brilliant. What? You're. You're putting us alongside One Foot in the Grave thing. That's been going like. Like 10 years. And I went all this way. You're putting us alongside. It beat us, Steve. Get over it. It beat us in the Comedy Awards. No, I was just saying that you're an identifiable face if you're at Formula One event. You know, old grumpy. One Foot in the Grave. Yeah. Anyway, Carl, any thoughts before we move on on anything we've said so far? Elvis Costello. Well, I'd like to play Red Shoes. Are we ready? Not yet. I'm just saying, do you know who his dad is? Declas McManus. No, Declas. I don't know who's really. Declan McManus. He was a big band leader in the 50s or something, wasn't he? No, he was in the R White's Lemonade ad. Oh, was he? Oh, no, there's so much to do with that. Good. So we're catering there to the audience listening, who are 50 and above. Well, I don't. And I'm the target audience. I'm a secret lemony drinker. Oh, whites. Oh, White's Lemonade. You must remember that. Never heard that. Oh, those chimps that drink tea. Oh, once, right, in school, we had a French dictionary and no ice, cold Coke. Coke on the back of my throat singing hello, Summertime. It's the real thing. Remember that? No. Oh, you were there. We translated that into French. That's at the end of that story. Yeah, that's the end of the story. But I know it in French. Do it. But it doesn't make sense. We just literally did the word. Go on. I can't believe you remembered it. Trespoix, Coke solidariere. A mongol chante bonjour, estival temps la. That's the only French you know, isn't it? It's not even French. We just did it word for word. It doesn't make any sense. Can you say another word of French? Can you quote Le chomme de matante? Can you. Can you. Can you quote anything else? Is there anything else you can quote other than that? Is there anything else you learned at school that you can remember word for word? No, nothing. Le chat le mieux. I don't just mean French. I mean anything English. Maybe some. A bit of poetry that you can read. Yeah, go on. Quite a bit of poetry for me. Like whatever you want. Light through, under window Breaks it is the eastern Juliet is the sun. The rise first sun and kill the envious moon who was already sick as well. What do you want really count? What, Shakespeare doesn't count? No, because that's the way everyone knows that one. I'm going. What then? What should I know? The Wind Hover by Gerald Manley Hopkins. Well, you can do that one. I caught this morning's morning minion. Kingdom of day night. Still thinking Falcon and his riding of the hover. Oh, no, no, we haven't done Carl yet. Wait a minute. K, man. Anything you can remember from school that you learned that you had to maybe memorize French. Not necessarily French. You could be anything. Anything you can remember. This can be anything you remember from school, apart from the orange stuff stops Cancer. Yeah. It's not the cough that carries you off, it's the coughing that carry you off in. Beatles Revolution. Was that clear? Yes, it was. Yes. Yeah. Good. We got to speed this up because we're. We know. It's funny because our first link, when we had to go like the. The library and the. The playlist when we played a record, car went. Usually at the end when you've run out of stuff. Yes. So we started with what's usually our worst bit of material. So I think we've got to turn this show round. Right. Carl's been holding this together. To be honest, it's Carl's beautiful naivety. And could I say it, Carl, in the nicest way? Stupidity. Yes. That are keeping the listeners. I wouldn't class it as stupid. I'm only joking. I'm only joking, mate. Of course you're not stupid. Everyone knows you're not stupid. You're sincere and that. And that can sometimes be, you know, frowned upon in this cynical world. Would you say you've learned stuff from me in the past few weeks? Definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely. Rather like a scientist learns. More like a injecting mice. Yeah. No, I've learned from you about ants and stuff. I think every week, as weeks go on, I feel like we're learning from each other. I'm learning more now than I did when I was at school. And can I just clarify. Yeah. You. You weren't raised as an experiment and you've escaped from a laboratory. You are. You had regular upbringing in Manchester and that. Yeah. I think I didn't go to school much because me mum and dad had a caravan. Right. No need. Is there no need when you've got that sort of fun at home? I used to just go away for weeks. Really? Yeah. Is that true? Yeah. Honestly, where's used to go? Port Maddock. And so you didn't go to school much? No, I did, but not as much as everyone else. Yeah. How many holidays were your parents having? What was their income that they could. No, my dad used to work nights and he used to travel back because. To Manchester from Wales. It wasn't that far. He used to do four on and four off. So me and my mum were like loving it. But what's Port Meredith? Port Madoc. Port Maddock. Down the road from Portmeirion where they filmed the Prisoner. Right, so that's cleared out for me location wise. So what did you do then? You were in this little two berth caravan on the back of a Cortina estate. Right. Well, what was it? It was a car. I want the. What was it for? Granada. Ford. Granada. What we talking, 1980? Yeah. 82, 83, 485. Okay. And you in the car down there. That down there. Park up. Yeah. What was it? What, what was Port Meredith? Port Maddock. Remember, Ruth? Oh, yeah. It's just a holiday camp. Yeah. And at an arcade and a beach. I was what? I was loving it. Yeah. But so. So of the 52 weeks of the year, let's assume, I don't know how many weeks you take off normally for holidays anyway. Let's just say, I don't know, you go to school 45 weeks of the year. Maybe. Generally most kids bit less than that. How many weeks would you say you actually spent in school? Well, how many weeks do you have off for summer? Well, we just. We'll work that out. That's what we're doing. About 6 off for summer, about 3 for Easter, about 3 for Christmas. Put it this way, I'm surprised I'm not Welsh, to be honest. Right. Because I was there more than was in Manchester. Did they not. Did the school authority not come and check you out? No, they didn't. Didn't get Manchester. I suppose they didn't care, do they? Not really. Yeah. They're lucky you turned up at all. What did you just turn up for the last day when you could take in your best toy. Did you know that? Or you could take it any game. Just play with everyone else's. Why? You know I break my stuff. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Well, this answers a lot. This does answer a lot. The fact that you spend most your time on the beach as a kid. Teachers were now good at my school. We were talking about it yesterday. So you were teaching them a lesson by going off in the summer? Yeah. And did you go to university? No, no, no, no. Did you go to sixth formal college? No. When did you leave school? When I was about 15. Right. What, you just went on holiday and didn't come back? I just got a job early, didn't I? Because where was it? Port Maddock Getting there? No, I was a printer. BM Print in Trafford Park. Well, that's great. That's a little interview there. Yeah. Next I'll be interviewing Steve Merchant. What are we playing next? Bit of Elbow. Oh, this is fantastic. This is Elbow. Elbow. Asleep in the back. I. I think that is absolutely beautiful. I think Albo are my favorite new group. We've sang their praises many times and they've never phoned to thank us. Should they? Yes. Do they? Really annoying. No, they're doing a good job there. I wonder if they found their lyrics, because I also wanted to write a song for them, didn't I? They didn't take me up on that either, Steve. I'm not sure I'm so keen on them, though. Carl, can I have a Jaffa Cake, because I've just found a lump. You don't mean me, do you? No, no, no, no. All right, good, thanks. Now, we interviewed Carl there. I think we've learned a little bit more about Carl there. And I'm gonna interview Steve now, Carl, because I used to be you concentrating. Don't put it all in at once, Carl. Chew. Chew before you swallow. Careful. Alright. I used to suffer with that a lot. What? Not chewing. The amount of times I nearly died as a kid. What? Forgetting to chew. Choking. Sure. Mint Imperials. My mum stopped drinking them with water. She'd have to hide them. He's coming out of his shell, isn't he? He's Happy Saturdays. He's miserable all week and he's Happy Saturdays, isn't he? Oh, look at him. It's like we get him weekends. Yeah. Yeah. And he's just happy because we sort of spoil him, don't we? And he has Jaffa Cakes and everything. We let him on the radio live with his stepmother. Oh, no, the ones who listen. Oh, really? Your girlfriend does, doesn't she? I imagine she's been away for ages. I know. I imagine she just switches off after a while. But, you know, you know, we. You know we love you, don't you? We're excited. We talk about you in the week and we, you know, we think you're great. So don't just think we're using you. As a cheap comedy material. I hate you to think that. Right no, I'm gonna interview Steve, you know, because I used to be a chat show host. Well, I am a Chacho host. Well. Well, did you see me at Ricky Gervais? No, I worked on it and I didn't watch it. No one watched it. That's terrible. What do you think, Kyle? I loved it. See? Are you thinking of Parkinson? And I didn't know Ricky then, so I'm being fair. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'll interview Steve Merchant now. Okay. Live on air, XFM 104.9. We should say that more often. Yes, because they might choo. And I think they've got a hospital radio by mistake. Yeah. Ricky Gervais. Yeah. Okay. Steve Merchant. Great to be here. Hi. Now, you're a very tall man, if I might say. You're 6 foot 7, aren't you? Yes. Was that a bit of a problem at school? Well, yeah, a few. Few jokes here and there. Yeah. Gentle ribbing, but not too problematic. What's the weather like up there? Well, exactly. Skinny. Oh, you're lanky. Oh, dear. And, but what about the glasses? Well, I wear glasses. But again, they wouldn't be a problem. You know they call you four eyes. They call you four eyes. Freaky lank thing. Freak pot. Freaky the freakish. I'm just saying they didn't do that. That's an interview. I'm not sure that's the best approved. Okay, okay. And then you left school. You left school. Yeah. You went to university there. Were you called freaky? Four eyed git? Are you sure? Never been called it. Were you called freaky, lanky, four eyed, stupid hair, boggle eyed, Freak face, Fish face? Is your church are coming back? Is this what you said? I never watched you. Is this what you said to people? Like. I mean, you had some big names on there, didn't you? Tony Hart. Yeah, that bloke off Ground force. Well, the problem was they'd either heard me or they hadn't. Either way, it was a problem. Yeah, it was a. It was a. It was. It was a problem. Who would you say was the biggest name you heard? They're all dead now. Probably the youngest one survived. I think Penny Smith is still with us. Right. Yeah. Biggest name you had. Savile, you had. Daniels. Paul. Yeah, Paul Daniels. Yeah. Yeah, but which was the biggest name would you say that you had on the show from the 1970s? Of course. He was a joy. No, but. So that's just. But it's not coming back though, that show. We're not it. No, not, not. Not in that form, they. The Channel 4 wanted to see some changes. What sort of changes? Ratings. Now I'm going to play a lovely track. Thanks, Steve Merchant. Thank you. I'm gonna play a lovely track about Elvis. I think one of his first hits. Maybe even be his first hit back. Back in the 70s. This is red Shoes Zinger meets Spry, apparently. I've never heard of him. Sounds good. It's about Spry, though. But the car reckons it's spray song 2 cover of blur Song too. Yes. You wouldn't recognize it in the dub version. No, in an old school Reggie dub style. Nice. Lee, Big them up. Yeah. Oh, we know all that. All the wording. Oh, we know. We know all that. Yeah. So, yeah, that was. That was quite interesting. I quite like that. Yeah, that's not bad. Filled up three minutes before that album. Stella. Red Shoes. Lovely. What a great song. Debut, was it? Debut single? I think so. It's the first one I remember of. His, but, you know, probably give Elvis a call, won't we? And. Yeah, he's a power. Yeah. All the celebrity. Yes. You what? Because you told me something else about your celebrity world that I thought might be of interest to the listeners. I don't know if you're happy to mention it. What? Your forthcoming TV appearance. Oh, yeah? What is it? Invited? I don't usually do these things. Yeah, but I. I sort of quite like the show. I've watched it for a while, so. On room 101. Have you seen this, Carl? Do you know that show? You don't like it? No. But is it still Nick Hancock as well? No. Who is it? Paul Merton. God, is he still around? I've seen him for ages. He's probably gonna be a great pal of mine come Tuesday. No, sir. I mean, that doesn't make any difference. No. Have you got all the channels tuned in? Paul Merton's a huge star. He's on all the time. Yeah. Nah. Is he a Heck, yeah, he's on there. Have I Got News for you and all the rest of it. What's the rest of it? Well, Anyway, look, room 101 is the show. 101 is the show where you put in the things you hate into this. Imaginary room and I thought I'd do it because we're laughing. Because, you know, they let you speak and it seems like a bit of fun. What are you gonna put into it? Oh, well, ruin it when I. For all the listeners. Oh, right. Yeah. Switch off now if you don't want to hear what? Ricky Gervais is gonna put in room 101. I don't know, just things that irritate me. Like, I don't know, I'm putting in noisy people, people who make unnecessary noise, for one thing. Right, right. Can I just stop you there for just one second? I was just thinking is just wonder if there's a little case there of the pot calling the kettle black, because you are the most annoying man ever in the history of all things. And I've met a lot of people in my life. I like to think even everyone, I mean, to anyone I went to school with who was possibly, I mean, an evil man, would throw things at people when, you know, the teachers just throw stuff at them all the way through the lesson, throw things at the back of your head, even. He was not as irritating as you are, really. Just. Just the fact that you're just crunching up a plastic spoon now, what good is that? It's annoying. Yeah, I know, but. Oh, it's just. You're so irritating. You're always making the little noises, just little sounds all the time. We were working yesterday. We were working yesterday, right? And I was typing this and he had an elastic band between his teeth, right? I don't know how he'd got. You know how he just seems to end up with an elastic band between his teeth, right? And he was flicking it so it was making a noise. Boom, boom, boom, boom. What were you saying? You're just going. The rain on Spain was mainly on. The plane in Spain stays mainly on the plane. Just kept doing that, right? Repetitively. I eventually. I don't know what you're doing. What are you up to? He went, sorry. Tried to wrap the elastic band around his face, right? It flipped up, hit him in the nose, right? He screamed because her obviously came quite tight. Then he said to me, he said, if I can flip this elastic band and hit your glasses, not your face, but if I can hit your glasses, can I flip the elastic band at you? I went, well, how am I going to find out if you can, you might hear my face. He went, well, why don't you cover up the skin on your face, your nose and everything with some paper? Which he did. Yeah. Just to keep you happy. Yeah. And then he flicks it. So I grabbed it, flicked it at him. He ran off screaming, swearing at me. Don't throw it at me. I was saying, don't be childish. Retaliation is childish. I did it first. So pathetic. Endlessly. Just this kind of. No, but you know that you agree with me on the people who just like, I can't stand noisy is people who go, no, no, like that. And people eating crisps, as I said before, people eating crisps. Cinema. Well, anyone who's making noise in the cinema, they must be mental. They've gone to see a film. There's people, they don't know that everyone's. Paid eight quid and they're crunching away. I'm leaving their phones on. There was. I was in the cinema. There was a 16 year old girl, took a phone call in the cinema. The film was running, she said, and she went, hi, yeah, I'm in the cinema. Start having a conversation on the phone. I was thinking, how important is this call? Yeah, you've got to receive. Oh, it's Tokyo ringing. Yakimoto's there, the deal's going through. It's Saturday afternoon, you should be up there. Hairdressers. I just was. So I was in the circle. Oh, by the way, Mr. Yakimoto's coming around tonight and we can't use my pad, so you've got to make him a meal. Yes. Don't you and your wife muck things up for me. But I was in cinema. This was not. It's not long ago. And I went to see that. This is. I think I was off to see that film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or whatever it's called, you know. Well, they could be on the phone for that because there's subtitles, so it's not gonna ruin it, is it? It wasn't her. This was. I was sat next to another woman. She was crunching a big fat woman. No, but he's got, he's got a good point there. Loads of people could be on the phone in there and it wouldn't sort of niggle you. Fine. Well, at least we've cleared that out. Imagine if that was true because, well. It'S like when you go on the tube and read a paper. There's loads of noise, but you can still concentrate, can't you? He's got you. That's such a great point, isn't it? Right, yeah, because it's so easy to lose yourself in that magic realism world, you know, with all the sound effects and music and surging, exciting noise and there's a woman clattering on going, yeah, well, I'll probably meet you later, Stange. Should we get some Diamond White in and around by the park? Yeah, chuff I do it. Yeah, but we know what you're like. Yeah, you can switch off, Carl. It's like you can turn your Ears off. That's the skill you have. It's not the ears, it's the. It's the behind the ears. Yeah. It's the process that between the ears and the brain that you can switch off so he can still hear all these things like a cat. But I was in the room. There's this woman sat next to me. She was to a big phone. She was crunching on some popcorn again, that's a crime. Why they're selling popcorn in cinemas. I don't understand. Why the noises regularly? Why not the noise? Why the noisiest food in a cinema? Yeah. I don't understand why that's come about. Yeah, really makes me angry. Yeah. Smoothies. We want smoothies without straws. Exactly. The trailer for that film, AI Artificial Intelligence came on. Do you remember that? And the tagline was, David is 11 years old. He weighs 60 pounds, he's 4 foot 6 inches tall, he has brown hair. His love is real, but he is not. Oh, yeah. And she just went, how old was he again? To her boyfriend, just ruined. War film trailer comes on for some Pearl Harbor. So she goes, yeah, don't fancy that. Just announcing this, don't fancy that. Too many war films. So then the trailer, then the opening credit comes on for Crouching Tiger. Before that, you know that thing that comes up that says it's signed by the BBFC and it has the kind of certificate and everything and that certificate to say what age you have to BBC. That came up and it said Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in bracket subtitles. She went, it's not subtitled, is it? I thought this was the most famous foreign film for years. It won Oscars. It was a huge film. Everyone knew it was foreign. She goes, the credits begin. It says, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. She went, stupid name for a film. She just wanted to see it. She was with her boyfriend. So then it starts, right? Obviously it's in Japanese or Mandarin or something. She's like. And they're doing that. They're all talking in Japanese. Japanese or Mandarin, whatever. So they're speaking in this, you know, Japanese language, Oriental language. And she's going, don't they sound stupid? Don't they sound stupid? She's going. And then the subtitles come up and it's quite a weird kind of strange language they talk in. And shoes can't make the subtitles out either. It's both gobbledygook, just wittering on every step. I totally agree with you. But what I like in your telling of it, I know you sort of Getting quite. I'm generally livid. But she went Mandarin or Japanese somewhere in language. I don't know what else. It's a strange language. It's a strange language. So then I moved. I climbed over several seats, made a big huff of, you know, make a big show of moving. So next on the phone, just chatting on the phone. Oh, I got a mental at that. I was lit Now. I hate that film. I didn't enjoy it. I don't like seeing. I don't want to. Don't even think of it. It's subtitles, isn't it? What rubbish. That's why I get videos. Yeah, I should have thought that through, Carl. You're absolutely right. Lamb Chop. Yeah, let's play Lamb Chop. This is brilliant. This is from this CD that came out recently with the Uncut magazine. Occasionally they put out some quite interesting free CDs, and this was one that had various covers of Rolling Stone songs. And a lot of them were quite. Quite shoddy. But this was a brilliant, specially done, I think, for the. The cd. It's Lamb Chop doing a version of quite an obscure Rolling Stone song called Back Street Girl. It's just beautiful. Let's hear it. Danny Warhol's get off. Getting a little bit blase now. Steve's just wandered off to make the tea. He's talking to Dermot. Can he? Is he not really, is he? Yeah. Is he just down there? Can he hear this? No, that's. That is. That is a bit shoddy, isn't it? I'm going to see Pop Idol tonight. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Who's you think will win? Will or Gareth? I don't care. Don't you really? No, it was in. Was I boring you? Sorry. No, it was in Leicester Square. Right. The little lad. Yeah, in big coach with his head on the side. I mean, how long has he been around? An accident? No, but do you know, like, those ones that. Footballers have big heads? No, they don't really big coaches. I mean, he's only a small, big coach. What? Like. I don't know why he needs a trainers. You mean big coach. Look, if you're just gonna be like that, I'm not telling you. Sorry. Go on. A big coach? Yeah, on the side. And he came in his picture. His picture on the side? Yeah. Yeah. Right. And about 200 kids screaming and going mental for him. Really. I just don't think it's right. No, it's not. I mean, it's been around for what, a couple of weeks? And the way everyone keeps going on about his stuttering. What? You think they should really concentrate on worshiping worthy sort of things like S Club 7 and A1 and look who have been around for a year. So you pick on me when Steve's not. It's only a joke. Here he comes. Here he comes. He can't believe it. But it's just the way like they keep going on about the stuttering. Yeah. What's going on here? Well, you were late. What we meant to do. Oh, we can't possibly go on without Steve. Oh, we need Sting. What? Eh? See, that's the reason you shouldn't do it without me. I meant nothing. I have good reason not to let you have this cup of tea. But I will. Anyone float? Cheers. Thanks. Just saying that Carl thinks all this nonsense about Pop Idol is a little bit sort of shallow because they've not been around long enough to be worshipped by children. Unlike Santa Claus, who's been around well for Forever. He was in Leicester Square and a big coach of his own. Who was? Gareth. He's only a small lad. Biggest coach I've ever seen. A coach? Yeah, one of those like National Express coaches. He'd just probably come down from wherever it is he lives. No, no, no. With his head on the side. What? We went through this. His own coach. Not. Not like. You mean like a tour bus. Yeah, but with his. With his head on the side. With his face. His own coach. Was he driving it? Was he really nasty? We can't have a toilet break yet. You had your chance. Sit down. Wait till we get the service. I'm finishing this fag and then we're moving on. And if you're not bad from the toilets, I'm gone. Yeah, it's a lovely restaurant here. Alright, Jeff? Well, you know. Yeah, well, not my brother in law or anything. It wouldn't have been quite as snappy as that if he'd been saying all that. No, no, that's it. Everyone keeps talking about the stuttering, but they never go on about his asthma. And he's got really bad asthma. They don't. You're right. We should attack the asthma more as well. Do you think he's held that back for the final? Do you think he's bringing out the big guns for the final? Oh, and by the way, I've got. Did you. The way he does that. Well, he's trying to. That's his therapy, Carl. That's him trying to breathe in order to help him speak. That's his therapy. Have you guessed about the asthma? What you thought is Asthma was. Because he goes, that's him. He has to do that to get over the therapist. What? If you ever have kids. Maybe he hasn't got asthma. When you cross the road, don't bother looking both ways. Yeah. Just walk straight across. I love that. Am I the doctor saying that? Oh, asthma. No, he does. That's not asthma, then. Okay, well, we better operate. Yeah, we don't operate. He's just. No, he just fell over. No, I heard him breathing heavily. Yeah, we've got something lodged. I got. I've got a story about breathing heavily after this next record. Really good. Got you. Although Steve thinks it's Farah Monk. It makes more sense, don't you think? Munch is a bit of a rubbish word. Whereas Monk. Brilliant. Yeah, but let's not discuss it. No, let's not get into a. You know, a big highfalutin. Yeah, exactly. Phonetics argument. They can call themselves what they want. That's up to them. Good luck to them. Yep. Good guys. Good guys. Now, I am going to Pop Idol tonight. Yep. This is what started it until he said there was a young kid being screamed at by kids because he had his own coach with his head on the side. Yeah. You know, we did. You did. Sort of like. I don't know where you're going there, Rick, because you know who's gonna win? It's gonna be Gareth. And there's. No, not necessarily. Oh, it is. Don't even fool yourself. Trying to drum up some excitement. Well, look, wait. You see, they both got about the same vote, and. And Darius has got about a million and a half now. I don't think the Darius vote was sort of like the Gareth sort of floating voters because he, you know, because he's a cute kid and everything, and he looks like a Pop Idol and, you know, but he's not as good a musician. I think maybe when people went for Darius, they were a bit kitsch, but I think they might. Do you want to make a wager? Oh, I bet Gareth will win. Exactly. You see, you may as well stay home, Rick. You just want to go to meet PJ and Duncan. Yeah. They call themselves out on deck nowadays. Well, fair enough. They're my favourite. They'll always be P.J. duncan to me. And they're brilliant. They are brilliant, aren't they? They're the best presenters. There's no one else, like, on tv. That kind of unites everyone. I don't think there's anyone, really. I can honestly say, if they're being honest, that they don't Like Ant and Dick. I know. It's like there's no one else. Like, phone in if you don't like Ant and Dad. I'd like to. Yeah. I'd like to hear your arguments for it because. Yeah. And I'm not saying about this ironically. Oh, I like a couple of kids presenters ironically. I think they're genuinely good. Yeah, they're good. They're like funny. Yeah. And you can see they've got a great relationship as well. They've got that sort of more common ways. Yeah. Everybody appeal. They're brilliant. Yeah. Well, we, we love out on Deck. Did you see in the week there was a Garrett. No. What's his name? The fellow that Dominic Mohan in the Sun. He's the kind of entertainment guy. Yeah, yeah. And he had sort of 10, 10 questions that should be answered about pop Idol because he thinks, you know, everyone's got a vested interest in Gareth winning. And there are various questions, one of which was, why is it that. What, Gareth only seems to stutter when he's being interviewed live? Because he's nervous, isn't it? Yeah. We've answered that one for you, Dominic. You realized that he'd written a list and he didn't really have enough to fill up 10. Although you, you were nasty about his style. You said it annoys you. No, I'm not arguing that the stutter annoys me. His query was he thought that he was affecting the stutter in order to win in the stutter. I'm annoyed that someone's stuttering now really. Annoys me because it's just embarrassing. It's cringeworthy. See, the thing is, I know people say, oh, it shouldn't be. It shouldn't be an issue. Right. We're talking about a pop idol. Now. No one, everyone accepts the fact that he's got to be a good looking guy to be a pop idol. We all accept that. And I'm saying I also want him to be able to speak properly, to be my pop idol. I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with having a stutter, but I'm not saying there's anything wrong with being. That is true. That is true. If there's a body fascism. Yeah. There should also be a vocal fascism. Yeah. But there's not a trauma if you don't look like a pop star. There is a trauma in society if you can't speak normally. So it's a much bigger issue, his trauma. Well, yeah, of course, of course it. Is, but it's not. I'm Not. I'm not arguing about what we see because a lot of people think that a lot of people get abusive. They're ugly. I mean, I'm guessing. I'm assuming that's the case. Well, I can't speak very well. I don't know if that's the case. But we'd make one great pop star between us. I don't think so. My looks and your talkie. Although you sound like some sort of weird words or. I'm not trying to be a pop idol. People can idolize me in their own small ways. Oh God, look at us 3. Imagine if we tried to be like BB Mac or Light funky ones. I'm just thinking of like three good looking guys. Genesis. Did I mention about when we were in America, Did I mention that last week, the police? No. Did I mention this to you, Carl? Oh, I mentioned it last week. Yeah, when we. I was in America at a wedding. Went to a wedding with some friends. We were walking through America, five of us walking down the street in New York and a car pulls up and some Chinese tourists lean out and they went to us. Excuse me, are you NSync? And we said, yes, we are. And they were taking our photo and stuff. Just think of Steve at the back, 2 foot taller than the rest. Which member of NSync is 2 foot taller than all the rest? Don't Chinese people like tall people or something? Right. Play a record. No. No, seriously. No, no, because it's. I don't think you know what you're talking about. Yeah, Carl, we're likely to get in dangerous territory. Yeah. Don't Chinese people like tall people? There's something I'm sure. I'm sure. Do you know like I was hone in. If you're Chinese and you like people. What worries me is that when they did Chinese lessons, you were down the. Beach in Wales in Ruth Maddock. Ruth Maddock. Paul Maddock. Do you want to play Lou Reed? Ah, this is Song for the Lovers. This is a beautiful track. It's Satellite Love. It's classic. It's gorgeous. It's Lou Reed. Rick, can I dedicate this to someone? Go on then. Carl, you shouldn't have. You shouldn't have pressed the button. Well, Dazzy's doing his job. You shouldn't have said. Can I dedicate this to someone? We've had a letter. Yeah. Sophie wants to dedicate a song to her boyfriend Peter. They're fan, firm fans of the show. Nice. Play Satellite I Love for them by. Beautiful Song for the Lovers. Don't Ruin it this time, Carl. Oh, brilliant. How to ruin a song, Ricky J. Do you want to explain what you were doing? I was just singing along to the backing vocal. You're not just singing along. Doing it like a mental. Just give us a blast. Well, I haven't got my headphones on. I've got to do it in time, haven't I now? Because. Wait, was it. Is it finished? It's finished, man. And it was just going. When Bowie. Satellite. I was going. Like that. Yeah. But you in room 101, you're gonna put irritating people. But it's something nice. What I can. Are you gonna climb down that little thing and climb in yourself? Yeah, yeah, maybe. You know, they have sort of a visual representation of the thing that irritates them. They always have that. Like Shakespeare. That would be a bust of Shakespeare's head. Which is a good review. Yeah. Oh, dear. Barry in the background. Satellite. I love Song for the Lovers. I should have. I should have liked Satellite on air. I love the idea of you when that came out, you know, sort of 17 got a girl back to your place, you know, just. Just making out with her. Just. That record's all in the background. You just go, I'm gonna have to shoot off now, Rick. Just hang me to it. I'll enjoy myself. I'll finish myself off. Ooh. Oh, dear. Oh, you can't do that. Oh, we've cheapened that song. You've ruined that song forever for me. No, I haven't. But it's six. See, the thing about Lou Reed is because Perfect Day, just a genius song. But we can never play it now, can we? Because of that BBC. No, because I'll tell you what, what's her name coming into the end M People. Yeah. Oh, I think she does with her voice song. There's a couple of songs that have kind of like I Always Remember. And where's that one that goes. It's such a perfect Day. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, that's the song. Were any other songs ruined because of their association with things? That song First Time, which was on the cocad. First Time. First Love. Was that. Wasn't that Four Non Blondes? That was Robin Givens. Yeah. What was the. Didn't Fall on Blondes do so much like that? No, I just keep seeing Four Non Blondes in the. In the playlist. I think Four Non Blondes just. They ruined their own career by writing songs. Yeah. Becoming a feature. Yeah. We should play 4 non blondes 1 week. Rick. I was going to say something to You. Before we got sidetracked. What are we talking about, Carl? Oh, we were talking about. We nearly lost it, but I think we pulled it back. It's okay. No, we had a fascinating fact that we were going to. Oh, yeah. If everyone in China. Carl, this is true. Carl, wake up and listen. Listen. If everyone in China jumped, it wouldn't be. It would be hard to coordinate. They need hands across America. They did. Up. Up yours. The laws. Right. We can coordinate this. We can get the sun involved or something. Like everyone. A billion, 1.2 billion or summer jumped up and down at the same time. Shut up. You're not saying this clearly. It would cause a tidal wave that would destroy America. If every person in China jumped up at the same time, that would cause a tidal wave that would destroy America. Apparently, according to physics. According to physics it is. No, true, true. It's a fact. I'm not. We're not making this up. We both know this is a fact. We're not making it up. We've heard it. But obviously. I don't know. I don't know what that's based on. Someone going. Just had a terrible thought, Mr. President. What is it? No. You know the atomic bomb and all that. Yeah. Forget it. Forget it. If everyone in China jumped up and down, they'd wipe us out. Right? You know what I mean? See, there should be some Chinese leader just threatening them with that. Yeah, Just show them a picture of everyone just poised. Just pictures of China people just crouching on pogo sticks. Just a billion Chinese people just all said on. On. On the Great Wall of China. That be brilliant, Carl. He's dumbfounded. He's scared. He's scared now, ain't you? But there's more chickens in the world than people. Oh, Play record. Well, that's brilliant. Substantiate that, please. Get. What an amazing track. Incredible. No one else is playing that on a Saturday afternoon, Rick. No. Are they? No, I wouldn't have thought so. That's. I mean that in a good way. I mean that like we're breaking new. Territory when the best. Oh, no, I think Dr. Fox or Simon Bates said that about a track once. Really? This has got to be the best intro of a rock song ever. The fact that I was saying it about the who and he was saying it about Money for Nothing is irrelevant. Yeah. Oh, no. Someone made me sit in their car once with their new car stereo system so that they could play me the beginning of Money for Nothing. Oh, just sat there. You've probably got that in the library. Haven't you? Is it right, that Rod. Roger Daltrey? Yeah, yeah, that's right. His kid is in EastEnders, the one who plays Robbie Something my mum told me. I don't know if she's got it right or wrong. It does look like Dean Gaffney. Yeah, but he didn't want to go off his dad's name and that, so he's changed. So he used his brilliant talent, his fox face. Do you know if that's right? I don't know. It looks like him, don't it? Well, I'm sure that's libelous if it's wrong. Oh, right, yeah. You'd be ashamed to have Roger Daltrey as your dad. Well, no, but Roger Daltrey might not want it getting around that he gave birth to Specky. Yeah, right. Actually, I see what you mean. Specky. Spotty. Spotty. So I looked at you. Yeah, all right, calm down. You've got a nice clear skin. At least I didn't call you spotty. Goggle eyed freak boy. You got a nice skin, not a nice complexion. Smooth faced goggle eyed freak boy. Fish. Thank you. Yeah, let's be nice. Car. What? Don't you like us arguing? Is it like Mum and Dad arguing? Do you get all. In the caravan, there was nowhere to escape to. Oh, no running around. Did you make any friends when you were down on the caravan site? Yeah, a lot of people from Birmingham were there. What kind of pals did you have? What were their names? I can't remember, it was years ago. But they all had rich parents, right? Like they had like their own car to drive around the campsite on and all that, right? Yeah. So I. Their own fence and. But they were mates. And you saw them every year, did you? Or every three weeks when you went down there? Yeah, yeah. You didn't keep in touch with any of them? No, I admit now I went. I went to the same place in the caravan for about six years running. I went to a place called Riverside in Bognor because someone round the corner from us at a caravan, two birth caravan, me, my mum and my nan. I think I'm really lucky to have. To have had it really, because a lot of mates who I had didn't have enough money to go on holiday and they just get a present for the summer holiday. I would like. I would just like. Of course they've got an education, so. Yeah, but Carl, the thing is with car is right, I want to give him gifts. Yeah. I wanted to be able have the loveliest Christmas ever. I Wanted to go pony trekking. Do you know what I mean? I wanted to. Just scared of horses. So many things we don't know about. Carl. Fell off one out of fate. And the woman didn't know what to do. She couldn't handle the horse. It was running off. I was hanging underneath, getting a kick in the head, really. Now, hang on. What age were you? Is this gonna explain a lot? I was about 6. That makes a lot of sense. I think we got to the bottom of it here. Oh, no. Got kicked in the head by a horse. Lived in a caravan and had to live in Wales half the time. Oh, then I wonder, this is your favorite time of the week. Do you look forward to this all week? These two hours? It's all right. What would make you truly happy? Car. Do you mind me just asking that? What would make you truly happy in life? I was thinking about it in a week and I don't know. You don't know? There's nothing that you particularly want, that you feel like, once I've got that, that. Well, the easy answer, there is money. In it, but, no, it's not true. If it's true. No, you know, you just didn't need enough money. You feel spiritually satisfied. Yeah. Yeah. Carl, have you embraced the good word of the Lord? What do you mean? Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. We're having a meeting tomorrow. It's in the church, and we'd like you to come along. I went to a church. I got to say this. I. I was with. I've got this. This housemate who I don't know that well. I've been living for about two. Two months or something. Right. And he's in the kitchen, he's washing up, and I just turned to him and he doesn't know me that well because we, you know, we sort of talk to each other now, but we don't know. I just told him. I went, matt, have you got to know the good word of the Lord? And he went. And he looked at me with utter fear in his face. I just went, I just think we should sit down a bit and, you know, just talk about, you know, the word of the Gospels. And he just looked at me. He was utterly petrified. I just started laughing, cracking up. And it's the sigh of relief. It was absolutely petrified. It's a brilliant game to play. If you're getting a lift on a long car journey with people, you don't just bring that out. Yeah. It's so terrifying. Yeah. I went once, also another good One is when you pick up a hitch. I say, like, I wonder what this car would look like on fire. Exactly. Things like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sometimes I like to drive the wrong way down the motorway. Yeah, yeah. What does a knife feel like when it's going into your eye? What? I see that story in the Week with. With a farmer who got his arm stuck in a bit of machinery and he was going on about. I mean, he came on with a false arm, so you knew something was wrong straight away. You knew it wasn't going later. But he was. He said, I'm a farmer. I've been a farmer for years. And I'm always telling people, don't stick your hands in machines. He said, but I got off my tractor and the machine had stopped. And he went to shift some. I don't know if it was a Coke can or something that. That was in the field. Yeah. Oh, this is not the famous one. About 15. And he. He took his arm to the hospital and he was making jokes. His arm was a nice. He didn't take his. No, no, no. What it was. It was. His hand went in and the machine started again. Yeah. And it started pulling it. Pulling out his skin. So, like, the skin was coming off his arm. Yeah. And it was going around the rollers and he's pulling back like that. So he's like, oh, God. And the skins, like, being wrapped around and it's like pulling it so he can see his bone and stuff. Oh, no. And it was there for, like ages, going, oh, God. And he had a pen knife in his pocket. So he got that out with the other hand, managed to open it. I mean, that's. Yeah, because they stick, don't they? After a while. I've got. I've got one of those. The Swiss army knives. I can't do it with two hands sometimes once they get all full of gunk. He managed to do that with one hand. Yeah. Cut away at the skin. That's not true, is it? Yeah. Has he learned to farm again? Like the drummer of Def Leppard has learned to drum again. And they got like. Just like the handles farm now with just one arm. He was good because he was making a joke out of it. And that's. I think that's good. But that doesn't mean you can Steve, though. Sure. He had to cut his own flesh off to escape a combine harvester. He doesn't need you, you know, making wise cracks. Do you know what I mean? I just always remember getting a hot plate out of the oven. When I was younger and that absolutely killed yeah stuck to my fingers and I just thought the pain that he must have been going through. Yeah, it must have been what you must must have been worse than a hot plate. Oh it must have been worse than maybe dropping a pie. Yeah. Yeah I think you're right that's nearly it. That is pretty much XFM 104.9 fast approaching 3 o'clock it is indeed. Is that pretty much it, Carl? Is this our last link? I'd wrap it up yeah, yeah so. Would I actually A song for the ladies time and this is a song you put me onto, Rick. It's beautiful song Special view AKA telescopic love from the Only Ones the B side of Another Girl Another Planet they're. Only hit maybe well yeah I think one of them some great stuff on. The the best ones which it's just a band kind of another good Another. Planet that might be up for the best intro in a rock and roll record of all time I'll put up Won't Get Fooled Again and Another Girl on the Planet Foxy. He's already putting up money for nothing exactly. So maybe run that competition next week. Although Walk of Life is particularly Here comes Johnny singing all these gordies be. Bopaloola baby here oh geez oh nonsense. Walk of Life okay so this is a special view from the Only Ones the song for the ladies and that's it. See you next. Goodbye. I don't know I don't wanna.",
