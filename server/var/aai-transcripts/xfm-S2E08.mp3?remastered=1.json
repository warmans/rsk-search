The live is shite. I tried to get. Oh God. I had to go. I had to go to Capital Riding. Oh, I had to go to Capital Library to get a couple of records I wanted. Right. Place is falling apart. The email's not working. It's so shoddy. He's had two weeks off day. I mean, they. I really. They might as well bulldoze this, honestly, because for all the. You know, it is L. And we get paid peanuts. You get paid. You. Oh. And it really annoys me. They have to fight. Oh. Anyway, 4.9, I'm Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilon. Carl, you're back. All right, how was it? What, the holiday? Yeah. Well, it wasn't all fun, was it? Cuz my dad was in. Was in hospital. Oh, but he wasn't. He wasn't during the holiday. Not during the holiday though, was he? You came back from holiday and then found that out, didn't you? Yeah, but it happened when I was on holiday. Did you know that though, when you're holiday? No, because I didn't take my phone with me. Well, that's the weird thing is I got. I got a feeling when I was sat there because it normally happens when I first went away, that old fellow. With his packet out, when I went. To Ibiza, right, I. I had a feeling and I called home. My dad had punched it along. When you say you had a feeling, what do you mean? A feeling? Just like, oh, I should call home. There's something not right. But this time specific feeling. How did that manifest itself? What kind of feeling? I'm getting a bit of a lung feeling. A bit of a dad, love. That feels like a punctured lung. Hold on. But anyway, the ollie was good. We talked about it last week. Well, let's probe Carl about his holiday later because, you know, that's the sort of thing that audiences will stay tuned for. Rick, I'm pretty certain. Yeah. Find out about, you know, more about this radio business. You've hooked them already. Indeed. Yeah. Well, also I'm thinking we've got nothing. We'll say that. No, I resent. I used to put a lot of work in, but then I, you know, I think of the money, which is, you know, for me, pretty shoddy. Yeah. I mean you. I don't cash well. Exactly. Yeah. And you know, the whole thing is, the whole setup. It was raining today. I thought I should have a cabin, you know. Then the sun came out, so I walked in again. How are you? But I'll tell you what, I got a bit criticized last week as well. I only played ballads and same song. So I'm gonna rock out this week. I've been at the Capital Library, right, to get some good tunes. And what about a little bit of acdc? O took me all night long. Let's hear it. Well, that's cheered me up. In a better mood now. Yeah, good, that's great. Let's rock out today. Yeah, well, yeah, let's set maybe Stones. Brilliant. Yeah. Some of the classics. Yeah. When are we going to talk about Carl? Have we run out of stuff already? Okay, let's go. Okay. Now. Yeah. So where did you go, Carl? What was the story? It was my birthday, right. Went home after doing working with you a couple of Saturdays ago, right. Girlfriend was like, open your card, open your card. And I said, no, it's my birthday on Monday, I'll open it up. You obey by the rules, don't you? Well, there's no point. Well, exactly. Chaos leads that way, Right? So not an anarchist. Never has been. So anyway, she was. Kept going on, it was doing me heading, so I said, all right, I'll open it. So I opened it, ticket fell out. Surprise holiday to one of the Canary Islands. So. And what was your reaction? I mean, first one was, we haven't got enough money, right, for this, but I didn't want to ruin it. So, no. So I didn't. I didn't go on about that. And I said, oh, it'd be great. So I can't wait. Did you say it in that tone of voice? Well, it was good timing because I was tired and everything and I'm not a big holiday fan, but the timing was right. Yeah. I mean, it's the same as last night. I don't always like a curry, but last night you're in the mood, you get that sort of. Oh, yeah, curry feet. If you had a gold feet feeling, yeah, you thought. And then lo and behold, like you were eating the curry. It's weird, the paranormal, isn't it weird? Isn't it weird? They. They work in mysterious ways. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, right, the island, if I was on when she were here, I'd probably say it's a bit barren. Okay. Not much there. But if you get a hotel, you guarantee good weather. All right. Are you. No, what I mean is it'll Be a good holiday. If you get a hotel. Right. The weather's always good, so you're. So you'll have a nice. Yeah. And all that. And the food was all right and everything was going all right. I was just having a nice relaxing time. And how do you sort of spend your time on a holiday? You just lie around, that sort of holiday. Just lying around. I bought a book. You bought a book? Yeah. Okay. Ghosts? No, it was. It was short stories, Right. No, it was about, like. Like special days in our time and time before me and stuff. Oh, yeah. And it was like. It was telling you about how in. I think it was 1814, the Thames frozen up. Yeah. And all these stories are told by eyewitnesses. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So there's some fellow who was around in 1814 and the Thames was frozen, and people used to put market stalls on there and they'd do the shopping. It was like. It was like. Like an Oxford Street. Was that Mad Liar Charlie? No, because he's famous for that. Yeah, I'm sure. You know, I think that was Mad Lie Charlie. Yeah. So I was reading that and then after a couple of days was a bit like, oh, boring. Yeah, you can do. You can only do sort of so much lying around and so much reading. So Suzanne said, let's go on the beach, have a walk. You ain't gone on the beach. Where have you been up to this point, then? In your room? No, just like around the pool. Just relaxing and having a swim and that. Yeah. So she said, let's go on the beach. I said, all right, then. Yeah. So wandered down to the beach and first impressions are, yeah, it's all right, it's clean. Your criteria is so basic, it's rude. Hotel. Yes. Roof, good. Food, adequate. Beach, clean. Next. So I'm walking along and every. Everything's good. And, you know, there's a woman feeding fish bread, which I thought, that's different. Oh, what? I love that. He likes originality. He loves a bit of originality. He was feeding fish bread. This woman was there, like up to her knees in water. Yeah. And she was stood there. Was that the sea? Chucking. Yeah, chucking this bread. And I thought, what's she doing? And I stood there and watched for a minute and there was little fish coming up. I'm in the bread, I thought. So carried on walking and everything's going well. And then this fella comes towards me. Everything's going well. Clean, clean. Feeding bread. Two points. Originally, fella comes walking towards me. He's only got no Pants on. Oh. So I said, suzanne, what's going on? What? Did he turn to her like she knows more? So she said, oh, yeah, yeah, it's. She said, yeah, it's a new. It's gonna be a long story because. Can you pour that coffee? Can you give me that coffee over. Sorry, sorry. This is really bad. Yeah, because he's poor. Thank you. Just amuse yourselves while we talk. The coffee. Thank you very much. I have a cup of coffee, thanks. Yeah, cheers. Cold. Right, good. Okay. So, great. Thank you. So she said, yeah, it's a. It's an Oodie speech. So I said, all white. What? I said, we're all mixed. It's all mixed up. Normally on a nudist speech, it's a nudie speech. You don't go wandering on there when you get your clothes on or not. So it annoyed me a bit because there wasn't any signs. So this fella's getting closer. Well, the knob out was a sign. Yeah, Right. So he's getting closer and he walked past me. It was an old fella and he walked past me. Had a hat on and a little pipe and a big rucksack on his back, right? So he got me strictly naked. I'm walking along and I'm thinking, right, why do people want to do this? So straight away, it was. I wasn't on holiday anymore because most of the time when I'm on holiday, I don't think about anything. All right? Your mind's a blank. I just switch off. Right? But all of a sudden, this. This has got in the head now. And I turn around to look at. Him and check out his. And the bag. And this bag, right? I swear, it was massive. Right? What? You know, the bag. It's rock side. It's rockside. All right, okay. When I said. He said, there's an old couple coming towards me, I said, what was lower, the bloke's bollocks or the woman's ticks? And he said, well, that was another point. She might as well have wore knickers. That's what he said to me. So you saw the bag. So it annoyed me. Yeah, because the whole idea in it, this is what I think. I mean, I might be wrong, right? Might be wrong. Chances you never have been before being nudist. Right? What's it all about? I'll tell you on that. On that point, Carl, let's play a tune. Let's come back and we'll discuss. What are we gonna play? We'll discuss that very issue. We Have. We've got some ideas. We did chat about this last week, Carl, in your absence. All right, well, we'll play the coral. Okay. It's a good one. Yeah. Coral Dreaming of you on XFM 104.0. I'm Ricky Gervais, with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. If you just joined us, Carl is walking down the beach and a man has just passed him with his knob out. Yeah, his testicles out. And his is a huge, huge bag, apparently. Right, now we're gonna. We sum this up, you know, because we talk about last week. You know, you did, you did call me and tell me some of these things and we, we sort of mentioned it last week, but you just want to say your. Just give us your thoughts on nudity. Well, what I don't understand is, right, nudity. I thought it was all about, you know, sort of being free. Yeah. Natural, letting the breeze, you know, blow around you and that, that's. That's all I can think is of, like, the bonus of doing it. But you can get that by just having a pair of shorts on. Right. Because I'm not one for getting my kit off. It's just something a bit weird about it in it. Normally, if I go for a walk on the beach, I'll. I'll put a shirt on. Sure. But leave it unbuttoned. Yeah. Tease the ladies. Sure. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. But it just feels a bit weird. So it's best to cover your back anyway, because the sun. Yeah. But when I saw him and I thought, well, right, is he doing it to sort of be free and be comfy and all that? And then I thought, but he's carrying a big bag. I've got a pair of shorts on and I'm not looking at him thinking, I bet he's really comfy. Do you know what I mean? I wasn't going. I can't wait to get home and get me shorts off these. They're really annoying me, these, so. And that, that's just it. I don't get what it's all about. Sure, sure. Well, okay. Well, my advice to you is don't, don't, don't go to nudie speeches again. Well, I didn't, I didn't go again. Do you play, do you play volleyball? No. Well, there's nothing in it for you, to be honest. Carl, do you ever walk around the house nude? Not really. Only if, like, it's quickly to sort of jump out of bed and go and get a glass of Orange. But I've got to be careful because living on a high street. This flat's right across the way. Looking in. Yeah. And the thing is, a Chinese fella, there's a little. Exactly. And it was the other one. Is he the one? The old woman reading a book? Yeah. It could be dead for all we know. It hasn't moved. There's some bouncers and some bouncers. I think so, yeah. Is that euphemism there always. There's always. Her name's Carol. But, yeah. The only time, if I nip out so I could get out of bed at night, go and get an orange. I've still got to be careful because if they're awake and I open the fridge door. Yeah. They'll sort of see the light and the shadow. Turn around and the weird, long, stretchy shadow. Why'd you get. You get up and got orange juice or orange squash. You know, Robinsons, you can't advertise on. Why didn't you take a glass of that to bed with? Why are you getting up? Yeah. Because whenever I do that, I normally don't wake up. And it's a waste, isn't it? The man is a genius. Well, continuing our rocking out thing. Yeah. We're in a rock mood. Well, I think this sums up rock and roll, doesn't it? It's not called rock and roll, is it? Textbook. Xfm. There's only one way to follow them. Advert. Oh. Rocking. Carl, what have you done? Sunday, A day for divine inspiration. Your wardrobe's in need of a complete overhaul. Coldplay, the scientist. Do you think that's about you, Carl? What happened there with all that rubbish? Pressing the wrong thing, Going out. Don't want to go. I've sorted it now. Doesn't matter. Right. You've come back. You're not focused, Carl. That's what concerns me. Your mind's on other things. I'm all right now, though. You're ready to go? Yeah. You sure? Yeah. Okay. This is. I just. I'll tell you what. I'll tell you how focused I am. What? Got some new ideas for you. They've all been blinders in the past. Go on. Did you do any competitions when I was away? I think we did, didn't we? Didn't we give away a dvd, did we? Yeah, we did. We did, yeah. Go on. Yeah, I thought some. This isn't like radio, is it, as we know it. This is just people talking. If the mic's on, it's luck. If anyone's listening, I've you know, I've no idea what they think of this show. It's not a show. Not in the traditional sense, no. Okay, then you're gonna change with that kind of. The show suggests a certain form of presentation. Yeah. A certain pride. And when we do present, dare I say, some planning. Yeah. And when we do, it's ruined by him pressing the wrong button. Yeah, but I've got some planning here. Go on, then. What I did was when I was on holiday. Yeah, right. You said, you know, come up with a new idea. Right. So the best way of coming up with ideas is sort of thinking, sort of nicking a TV show name and then twisting it a bit. Yeah, so. Or just rip off Simon Mayo's idea completely. That's good advice for anyone out there. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. If you're interested in ideas, Carl is. Presently running a course right in for tv. And that's the lesson one, isn't it? Just rip some else off. Change the title slightly. Yeah, go on. This one I haven't really got. I don't know what to do on the game, but I'm thinking, strike it, Ricky. That's all you've got? That's. That's what you've come up with? How long did that through? What is that? I just thought you sounded a bit like Lucky. Forget that one, then. Yeah, forget that one. Okay. We all have. We all have. Hit some of these. Even Spielberg's. Not all his films, you know, can hit the. Go on. No. Okay. No, it's good. Remember Big brother? Yeah, do I remember Brother? Now, go on, Big mother. Right, you call in if your mum's ever. You win a cd. What do you mean? How can you prove that? All right, together. Right, here's one. No, no, no, the price is right. Remember that. Yeah, right. The price is Ricky. No, the rice is right. And what I do, I read from an Indian menu. In a Chinese menu, you tell me whether you have pilau or egg fried. He's a genius. Any. He really is a modern Ian, that one. Let's go into this one. Let's not cross this off right away. Go on then. What? You read from what? Well, I've got. I'll get a couple of menus from, like an Indian and a Chinese takeaway. Yeah. And I'll go like, Right. Oh, chicken korma. Well, could I just suggest that as it's an Indian, it will be pilau. And anything you read out, that is. Yeah, but you don't know which one I'm reading from. What the Chicken korma's Indian, isn't it? Yeah. So you go pilau. But then. But then. Well, you might as well say Indian or Chinese. No, because then the name wouldn't work. The rice is right. Okay, yeah, I forgot. You're working for the title backwards, aren't you? Okay, yeah. I'm so confused. I don't know where I am or what. What day it is. A program that they've been in on channel four. Right. Can you cross that out? We're not doing the right is right either. You don't understand the rice is right. No, I'll tell you that later. We'll have a game in the office. Right. A game that they've been in on Channel 4 but has got really big viewing figures. Well, obviously not. Right. Although I wouldn't be binning it. Go on. Do you know 15 to 1? Yeah. They're getting rid of that, right, are they? I'm thinking 15 Taiwan. Get some items that are made in Taiwan. Right. Get 15 items and I say what they are and then you go, oh, I bet it's the vase or something. That's one that's made in Taiwan. Yeah, Just explain that again very quickly. No, don't cross it out. Forget that. Cross it out. Fifteen Taiwan. Right, Go on. This is the one that I've prepared for because I think this is. This is my daft. This is good. Let's play a tune in this here. After that I'm so excited. Are we going to play it after that or are we going to say. No, you can explain. I'm very excited. Could you hear that again? Oh, fantastic. Waiting on a Friend by the Rolling Stones. Yeah, go on. And Carl on XFM 104.9 rookie Gerrasd merchant car bulging. Go on. Right, this one. Remember Blockbusters, huh? Right, this one, this one is good. And we'll do this one. Rock Busters. And remember how Bob Oleness used to give you a letter? Yeah. And it'd give you a question and the answer to that question is that letter. Yes. Right. Well it works like that. So if I said to you. Yeah, we'll test it out on you, Steve. Right, right. Welcome to the show on that. Hello. Let's play. Right? And I say, right, your first one is W and the cryptic clue because it's done like crosswords. So not quite like blockbusters. Well, this young man prepared for his death and it's a W. So the answer and it's not always going to be like our sort of music can be any sort of music that's out there. So the W is the name of. Of the answer. I understand that, but is the answer always the band name or is it. It's always the band name. Is it? Or the artist? Yeah. And. And so would the W be the surname or would you have both the initials? If it was someone's name, would Elvis Presley be ep? Don't get annoyed, Carl. These are. These are questions that I knew would be asked. I know this. He tested on me. So you've got to tell them. If it was Elvis. I'd probably do. I'd do E. No, no, no. Give him the answer. Give him the answer. Did you hear the clue? No. Give me the clue again, then. So the letter, it is a cryptic clue. The clue is fine. Listen. And the clue is, this young man prepared for his death. This young man prepared for his death. Yeah. This young man prepared for his death. And it's a W and it's his first name. That's what he needs. Well, see, that's the end. Yeah, but I don't. Look, shouldn't we have the initials? Wouldn't that make it easier? It didn't do that on Blockbusters. It just had one. They did if it was. If a gold run, they often had three or four letters. Yeah, but it was normally just one word. It wouldn't have been a name or something. All right, then. W, W, Y. W, Y. Will Young. Excellent. I didn't understand it for this young man. So he's sort of mixed, sort of cryptic. Yeah, I mean, you know, that's better than usual. So should we want to play. Let's play Rockbusters. Yeah, Rockbusters. How many of these have you got? No, let's just clarify a couple of rules here, Carl. Let's just make sure we thought everything through, because I'm pretty certain when they get these things on tv, they at least have a go at them in the office first before they put them straight on there. I'm sure that's how it works. I'm sure Bob Olis just didn't turn up the first day. And he goes up. We're all winging it. It'll be fine. Bring the students in, let's have a go. I'm sure they did a bit of preparation, so let's just check. We've got everything. Every base covered. Yeah. Firstly, how many questions have they got? Let's do this off air, then. Should we play a great. A great tune? Well, yeah, well, people need to call in, don't they? Because we're doing it, aren't we? Yeah, it'll be all right. And there's. There's good stuff. I've got CDs, right? I've got some compilation stuff and a couple of videos and that. So that's what they're playing for. Call up now. 0870. 0800-1234. Get them on the air. Play the game. Brilliant. Yeah, yeah. Is that all we're doing? Bit of the Cure, Just Like Heaven, right? Oh, that's from that Cure greatest hits song, Heart Attack. You get an extra bonus CD on certain copies, and that's an acoustic version of Just Like Heaven. Fantastic. He hasn't thought it through. I know. We've just three, three and a half minutes trying to figure out the rules. Yeah. Right, we've got it now. I'm sorry. For people to call in. The lines are going mental. Right, so hold on, everybody. What we're gonna do is we're gonna do an ad break. We're just gonna figure out how to play the game. We're gonna get two people on there and we're gonna play it. So what's going on? I don't know. The adverts aren't working today and I don't. I'll have to get an engineer in as well. Don't play the adverts. I don't want to play them anyway. Don't play them. It's not our fault if it doesn't work. It's. Why. Do you realize if we were, like, live, we'd be heckled off the stage? Right, don't play the adverts. We wouldn't survive in the real world. Sort that out. Right, Right. Get people on the air now. Just. Rick, calm down. Play a record, then do something, for Christ's sake. Brilliant. Pulp. Good news and bad news. Bad news is we have got enough callers to play Carl's game. The good news is we don't have to pay any W. Adverts. Yeah, in this show. So if it doesn't work. Solid. Right, who have you got on the line? Carl? Some. Now, let's just remind ourselves. What's the game? It's Rockbusters. Okay, now calm down, Carl. I know you're a bit stressed. You've got a lot to do, but don't worry, you just had a holiday. Throw this desk out. Just throw. Let's throw it out and start again. Rick, don't get stressed. Go on in. People. People wouldn't think it was us if this show wasn't, you know, half baked and ill formed. And generally Shodd, that's what they've got him to love. Okay. All right, Sam? Hello. Is it sounding all right today? It is just about all right. Cheers. Sounded worse. Who else have we got there? So we've got. We've got Tim as well, haven't we? All right. All right, Tim. Tim and Sam. You sound quite similar, lads. Could one of you affect an accent or something? Which one's Tim? Yeah, it's me. Okay, which one's slightly deeper. Slightly deeper. And they're not against the clock anyway, are they? So it doesn't really matter. I suppose not. So I think Steve just wanted a bit of variety. Okay? You understand the rule, lads. Can you explain them to us? Right, play it. Okay, hang on. Wait, wait, wait. Let me. Let me explain. Because, I mean, life is too short now. Carl's gonna read out, say, three clues. Yeah? And just. Just shout your own name and answer it. Or shout the answer. Shout your own name. Then the answer, if you know. And it's the person who gets the most. Right, okay. Is that all right? Yeah, yeah. So here we go then. Okay, then. Shouldn't it be the first of three? Well, yeah, but then he hasn't got. I've got enough. It's fine. He's got enough peace for that. Right then, here we go. Welcome to the show. Right, first initials ST Right. Is that right? Well, I don't know. We don't know, do we? How do we know? Here we go. ST and the cryptic clue is better than the average homeless person. Okay. Sorry, I think. Is that a band? Yeah. Is it an old band? Yeah, I think that's one word. Alright then. S. S. It's an old 70s band. Better than the average homeless person. Tim. Super tramp. Yeah, yeah. Well done. 1.2. Rogers. Well, no idea why that's right, by the way. You don't know. You don't understand why it's right. A suit is a super tramp. Better than the average honest critic. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cryptic. Okay, second one. Come on, Sam, you got it. That's actually quite good for Carl. Trust me, Tim, that's. I mean, take that, take that as a good clue because. Yeah, okay, we won't do this again. Here we go. Right, the letter is F. That's the next one we're moving on to. And the cryptic clue is the little girl is hungry. What shall we do? The S or F? I've got it. S. Ready? Yes. One all. Feed her. He's pulled out. Feed her. Feed her. Yeah. So that's one each. So this is the decider, isn't it? Wait a minute, I see her on the phone. Well, you said first to three, so. No, it's not, is it? That's what I said. Just do the three clues. Who gets the most? Okay, well, we can do that now. So here we go. I love this. This is rubbish. Go on. So here's the last one. The initials are ak, right? And the cryptic clue is Exploding Pet. Say, shout out your name if you know it. Last orders at the bar, please. Last orders at the bar. Exploding pet. Ak. You're tuned to XFM 104.9, Carl Pilkerton's quiz Rockbuster. The format is still available. The highest bidder, please give us a call or you can email ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk Is. It a band or a singer? It's. I'll give you a bit more of a clue. It's a pop band. Okay. We wouldn't. Tommy Kitten. Yes. This is amazing radio. So who was that? The one. That was Sam, who was. So it's 2:1 to Sam. So he wins. What does he win, Carl? He wins some CDs and some videos. No, he's got. And. And obviously now, Sam, if you're ready, take the spot. You're going to do the gold run. Away you go, Carl. I haven't got any more. You're a fool. Right, stay on the line. We're giving both some presents. Play a record for. I've just. Rick, I'm going to shoot off. Feeder. Come back around. He's getting all stressed again. You know, we've only done an hour. I know, it's. I'll tell you what, this is another hour to go. I can't. I don't know what it seems like to the, you know, the listeners. I'll tell you this, I'm not trying to be disrespectful, Carl, but I think maybe someone else should come in and press the buttons because I'm not sure you're across it. I don't think you can concentrate on talking and working at the same time. I'm not sure you can. Walking. Yeah. For you, it seems. I don't say that. Look, he's gutted. No, there's a lot of gone wrong here. I say. I say throw this desk out and get a real one. Well, I think there's a. There's a Fisher Price when you can buy in Argos. That might be. Yeah. But yeah, we got there. We were stunned because it was secondhand, this one. But this is like the mere space station. I mean, it really is falling apart. Get a new one in. Let's not, you know. Oh, I can't believe it. Get the. I mean, look at the. Look at that. Look at the library. Look. Gap. Look at the gaps in the library. It's not going about this because this isn't. This isn't good. What? Whereas that quiz was. Whereas that was good radio. You can join in and stuff, Ms. Carl, why'd you rush to do it? I told you before, we should practice these things. Although, to be fair, Steve, I can't. I haven't got time to do anything. So at least Carl's coming up with stuff. But I don't mind, you know, running through it while you're having a kip outside. Really. What other ideas have you got? Have you got any other ideas, Carl? Because we're really. You've got another outfit? Have you got anything at all? I've got that feature, Educating Ricky, which is a bit of a play on words as well. Right. Do you know. Did you know the film, Steve? Educating Rita? Yeah, I see what you've done. Go on. I'm doing that and I teach Ricky stuff. What do you teach me, Carl? Well, I've got a few different topics. Go on. Do you know, like how you taught me about Hitler and Che Guevara and Winston Churchill? I'm gonna come in with topics every week and this week I've got ghosts. No, Hanging Bacon is one of the topics. Say that again. Hanging Bacon. Hanging Bacon. No, all the titles are sort of named to sort of make, sort of tease you and get you more interested in it. Hanging Bacon. Well, you've certainly intrigued. Go on. What's another title? One Hairy Chinese Kid. I go for that one. If there was a university degree with that title. Yeah. No, I'm gonna go for Hairy Chinese Kid. Final one. Alien gives man a beard. Right. Alien gives man a beard. I am gonna verse. Right, listen, Carl, you've gotta tell me. Right. First. Right, let's do it. No, we're not gonna do it now anyway. What do you mean we've got to do it now? I mean, that's the first you've said in an hour, okay? The listeners have just been subjected to rubbish and mistakes and everything for the last six months. Please. We've got to do Alien gives man a beard. What is that? Tell us that. Right, Sorry, this is just you telling. Me something, is it this feature is you telling me something? I'm teaching you something. Educating Ricky. So are we playing it now? We're already into this feature. Well, into this feature are we? Yeah, I suppose we are, yeah. Should there not be a jingle or something? Yeah. Can we have a jingle? There's no point because, look, I come up with ideas and you dismiss them straight away. So I'm not wasting my time making stuff. Right, well, okay, let's play. Let's play Educating Ricky. Right. Brilliant. Go. Right. Educating Ricky. Right, what we going for then? Hanging the bacon. Airy Chinese kid. Alien gives man a bit, I think. Alien gives me. I'd like to do that. Right. There's this fellow, I think it happened in America. And he saw a bright light in the sky. God, if you're bored. And he stood there. This is a true story, is it? Yeah. He stood there. Yes. Cause it isn't, Steve. And he saw this bright light and it came closer and closer. And it was a ufo, right? Yep. And he looks at it and it disappeared. Right. And he gets back in his car. He looks in the mirror. And he looks in the mirror. Yep. He's only got a beard. Yes. I'm sure it wasn't someone else who got in the car. And he was still standing out there. Right. What? And it turned out. Yeah, he got home and said to his wife or. Or his girlfriend, it's a bit weird. So I just got out the car to look at a bright light and I. I got back in the car, I grew a beard. And she said, never mind your beard. Where have you been for three days? And what had happened is he passed. Out because he was pissed. No, the UFO had taken him for three days. Yeah. He'd only thought that. He'd only looked at it and it went away. Yeah, but what had happened is he. Took him and he grew a beard because he hasn't had a shave. Right. Okay. I mean, was Will Smith or Tommy Jones anything to do with this at all? Did you see this on a video maybe and thought it was an educational film? No, it's from a book that some kind person sent. Sent into me here. Can I just ask again? Just, just again. I'm just throwing this right back at you. Do you think there's any other possible answer here? Right. A man is absent for three days from home. He's growing a beard. It could take to grow a beard. Lest we forget. What if he hadn't actually seen a bright light in the sky? What if he was lying? What if he was lying, he got. Knocked unconscious, he'd had a car crash. No. Just lying or he was just lying? Yeah. He'd been On a bender, getting pissed for three days. That was an excuse to his wife life. And they went, what are you gonna. What, Dennis? What are you gonna tell your wife? Well, wait a minute. She's not gonna believe I was out with you lads. Just say you're only away for a minute. No, she didn't know. I wasn't away from it because of the beard. Oh, yeah. It looks like you've been out for three days. Well, we have. That's exactly right. Okay, we've got to cover that, then. Alien abduction. Great one. Okay, let's try that. Do you see? That's a little scenario there that could have been played. So when you say Educating Ricky, what have I learned from this? Never listen to you again. That's all I've learned so far. Never listen to you. We'll add a little bit more in here right now. What do you mean, add a little bit more? We'll add a bit more to this. To this, what I'm educating you about. Go on. Right. There's only a law in America that says if you touch a ufo, you're going to get done. Now, why would they make a rule? I don't know that. Do you know, like, all their rules? I genuinely do not know what you're talking about. Right. Do you know, like, our ears? Do you know? I have no idea. Okay. Do you know, like, how I'm listening to Capital and these headcuts I got. I got Foxy on yesterday. Let's. Let's bend that. No way. I want to hear about Airy Chinese Kid. Let's play a tune. Okay, Play a tune. Definitely some dolls. Yeah. I just thought I'd go back, take it back to the 60s. This is a tune that a friend of mine sent me. If you touch a ufo, you get done. Soldier Kitchen from the Doors, shambles to, like this. David Bowie, Slow Burn. Quite a. Quite a Eno trilogy feel about it. Yeah. But. Yeah, enjoyable now. Okay. That's stressful, isn't it? I think we've got things working now. We've had people coming in and out, just shaking their head, going, shouldn't have bought that desk. But it's all sorted now, I think. And. Oh, you notice how it took about. 25 minutes for them to come down as well, though. Do you feel like we're maybe quite low in the pecking order in the building? Definitely. You know, it's like capital first capital gold. They can shoot off to other sort of pirate stations, people's car radios. Then they come back here. Oh, dear. Oh, Had a job at Richard. Sounds light fitting was buzzing now, but we've got. Thanks for staying listening. Right, okay, Educating Ricky. What have we got? Airy Chinese kid. Go on. Right, yeah, this is the. I didn't want to do this. Well, I wanted to give you three and I gave you one. It was like the alien man gets a beard or whatever. Yeah. Which was total rubbish. So this one should be better maybe. Hey, Chinese kid. Right, well, we've talked about airy people in the past, true enough, haven't we? You know the little kids who grew up in woods and hung around with wolves and that? Yeah, again, you're confusing that. Yeah, they're not. There were some people that were born a very hirsute. They were not the people who were brought up with wolves. You just put that together in your Homer Simpson type mind. Right, well, this is like a sort of. Sort of close to that sort of story. But the weird thing is, right, Chinese people aren't that hairy as a nation. No, seriously, that's. That's a well known fact. They don't. They don't have that much body hair and stuff. So this little kid who was born over there, he was like covered in stuff, was he? And it was only his nose that wasn't hairy. The rest of his body was caked in hair. Right. And his hair sort of. What sort of hair was it? Was it thick? Thick hair? No, what I mean is, was it sort of like a pony's mane? So he just looked like an Ewok, you know, I mean, just like hanging down sort of straight. In the picture, it looked like it grows from. It grows from his eyebrows quite thick and then it just goes all the way over. I don't think it was just really long eyebrows that he'd done a comb over. No, it was all over his body. He had a picture of like his back and that. Yeah. And he styled it. And he styled it at all. Do you have any quiff or. No, it was just. It was just hanging all over him. Yeah. And. And they were like, you know, this is a bit weird happening, happening in China, where we're not normally that airy. That was the scientist. The local press and that were getting him down, calling him monkey boy and. All this, and thinking Chinese press. But the Doctor. Yeah. Oh, they're cruel, aren't they? Like those game shows. That's Japanese, isn't it? Yeah. And the Doctor said, talking through all. That time while we were just like talking to each other then, because I turned around and I still saw he was talking. So, anyway, the local press came in to see the hairy boy, the monkey boy. They were like, being tight, taking the mickey out of him. And the doctor said he's only, he's only airy. Said he's a healthy young kid. The only faults he's got is he's got a little bit of eczema and a boil. He said everybody should just treat him the same. And I think he grew up a healthy, healthy kid. Yeah. So that's, that's the. That's. That's the end of the story. That's not a story. Why? Well, but I've got nothing. I don't know what to say to that. So someone was. Someone in China was born slightly hairier than the rest, and he was normal, apart from eczema and a boil. That, to me, isn't a story, but if it is, I've got a million. I mean, it's sort of like bloke from Manchester went a bit bolder than the rest, got a job on radio. It was normal. I mean, there's not a story, is it? Do you know what I mean? All right, then. Hang on, hang on, hold on. He's got the big guns. You're not going to give us hanging bacon, are you? Yeah. Come on, then. Come on, then. Come on, come on. This is it. No, this is a good one. This is the one. And this is a story. Right. Do you know the saying, chewing the fat? Good one. It's one of my favorites. Yeah, yeah. Do you know what it means? Talking. Right. Well, do you know where it came from? No. Right. What they used to do years ago when people didn't have much money. Is this the same as the bait throwing the baby at the bath water? No, it's not this. Well, it's not the same saying, but. No, but I mean, is it as wrong as that was? Let me tell you, okay, like, people go out to work and with the money they'd buy food. Oh, yeah, Come on. This is a good system. What? Go on, what do you mean? People got to work and with the. System, if you're quite well off, you might treat your family to some bacon, right? But you know, like in these days, if people earn a lot of money, they might buy a nice suit or, Or a car. What are you saying? You'll say, let me get this straight, you're saying that you got to work at money to. To buy things, to, to live. And if you get sort of enough money to live and you've got some leftover, you might treat Yourself on like a suit or a car or something. Is that what you're back then if you earned money, they'd say, this is olden times. Yeah, okay, let's get some bacon in. Right. And what they do, they'd hang it in the kitchen or to show it off. To show it off to all the neighbors and friends. Because if you were, if you had hanging bacon, it was like, he's doing all right for himself. Yeah. So they had loads of bacon hanging up and people would come round, right. And whilst they stood in the kitchen talking about whatever they're talking about in olden times, did say, do you want a bit of Ryan? And it's. And they rip a little bit of Ryan off and whilst they're having a, Having a chit chat. Well, I think that's probably true. I haven't heard that, but that one to me sounds true. Do you see the difference between that one and a man was abducted and grew a beard. Can you see the difference in why I accept that story? Different stories for different things. Different stories for different things. So see, that's a nice, that's a nice story. If it's true. I don't know. It's true. I mean, but it seems totally possible. Viable. Quite interesting. I won't be quoting that myself until I verified it, but that's, you know, I won't be telling anyone. The bloke got in the car and he had a full face beard. Why is carbon towed away? Because it was a quiet road. Was it in the way. Are you filling in the blanks again? That wasn't in the book, was it, that you read? See, that's the thing. Sometimes I think you make up bits of the story as though they were facts. That doesn't seem right. Well, that's all you can do in it. So. So that's Educating Ricky. Will we. Brilliant. Do that next week? That is brilliant. I think that was good. I, I did. I mean, I enjoyed that. I learned something from that. I mean, just, just I want to get. I mean this is all from one book, is it? Yeah, that's an interesting book. With it, with the. I, I don't know, dwell on it, but with the, With a hairy Chinese kid. What, what, what did they say about that? What did that, what was the. I mean, was it. Once there was born a kid who was slightly more hairy than everyone else, but yeah, it's all right. He only had a boil. How did they word it? How did they, how did this capture your imagination? Well, it was a picture that Grabbed me, first of all. Sure. And it was like, God, what's up with him? And that's when I read it. Did you see the boy in the XMO or just the hair? No, you see, because his face is like, just under his eyes is sort of nice and smooth and his nose is sticking out and that's not airy, but the rest of him, it looked like he had the sort of a balaclava on or something. And then. And then I read on and it's like, this is a hairy kid in China. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. Okay, good. Anything else in there? Because, I mean, I like. I like that. We'll do more of that next week. How is that alongside hanging bacon? Aidan? Objection. Abduction, a hairy Chinese kid. And a little interesting fact about the derivation of a phrase. What do you mean he didn't understand. The word of that? I knew the word derivation was going to cause problems. I thought derivation shouldn't have come out. I wasn't disputing. He's all. He's all smug because he's had a phone call that was back lost cause. Go on, tell him why you're all smug. Because Adrian just called up. Yeah. After hearing the story about the Chinese kid. Yeah. And he said. Yeah, that's true. He said that there was a TV program on it. Yeah. He had a. A chromosome defect and it made him airy. And his mum and dad used to have to shave him. That wasn't in the book. But thinking about that's not a good move anyway, is it? Because they say that for women, if you get a few hairs on your top lip, don't shave it because it'll grow back thicker and faster. So they should just, what, let him. You should have just said, well, let's see how bad it gets. But if they. If they went in there straight away as a. If he came out as a baby and a little bit airy, they should have left it for a little bit. But Adrian called up and said, yeah, he was airy. But we weren't disputing there was a. A Chinese kid born slightly hairier than the rest. We were disputing the fact that you didn't actually tell us a story. You just told us that that man was abducted by his for three days and grew a beard. That's definitely not true. No. We don't know about you in the fat, but it sounds quite viable. You see, the difference is between me and Steve and you is that what we believe isn't random. Do you know what I mean? It's not random. The thing. We don't believe stuff just because it's interesting. It's not every other thing we believe and every other thing we don't. We. Well, I can't believe stuff if it's interesting. Yeah, I know, I know. Yeah. If he thinks, oh, intriguing. And he said. He said to me on the. Before you got a minute, he said that Ollie's record. Yeah. Evie's my brother. What's that about, then? And I went, I don't know, I. I heard it was about someone who had a disabled brother and he was lifting him in and out of a car or something, and someone said, oh, do you want a hand? And he went, now? Yeah, he's not heavy. He's my brother. I. E. This isn't a burden for me. Yes. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Carl, what did you say? I'd say, no, I'll tell you what he said. He went, that's ridiculous. He was still heavy. And he said, don't turn down help. Which we were talking about that because a new feature we start in about this time every week. Oh, yeah, we start about this time every week. Yeah, yeah, we'll do that. Song's Got a Good Story. Okay. Love it. Snappy. Go on. There's loads of songs out there, isn't there, with. With songs that you couldn't fade out when you hear them on the radio. And that's. You don't want anyone to talk over the start or the end. Yeah. Because remember, we did this once before with Killing a Georgie by Rod Stewart, and I was a bit worried that it might have been a true story because we were, you know, joking about. And he went, oh, you know, that Killing of Georgie. He went, I think it is a true story. I went, why? He went. I listened to it again and Rod Stewart at the beginning says, this is a one of my best friends. It's brilliant, isn't it? It's genius. So there's loads of songs out there and what I want to do, we want to get the audience involved in this. So if you've got, like a favorite song that's got a really good audience. Yeah, go on. And the email in ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk and they say what the song is now. What would examples be, then? Examples, Ones that jump to mind straight away for me. Elvis in the Ghetto. Yeah, good one. Brilliant. Andrew Gold. Lonely Boy. Absolutely don't know. Eminem, Stan. All right, yeah, yeah, good one. You couldn't fade it out, could you? Because you go, well, what happened? Yeah, Absolutely. And that's. That's what I'm saying. Not just any sort of pop song that keeps repeating, beating itself. And, you know, it's like it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if it skips or, you know, I mean, if you turn the radio off. Yeah, but I'm talking about the fastest milk. Yeah, that is a good story. That is a good story. Oh, yeah. Did you know that one? Yeah, yeah, it's a story. Yeah. Ted from Teddington, he drove the baker's van. Well, so what. What have we got then? We got one. So we're going to kick it off today with Stevie Wonder living just enough for the city. Okay. And just, just. If you are nipping out, maybe you're in the car and you're about to pull up somewhere and get out. What it's all about is, is a lad who's growing up in, like, America in some rough area, right? And he's trying his best to do well and get a job and everything, but because of where he's from, he's stopping him doing that. Right. It's like how I grew up on an estate in Manchester. I had to leave there, there and come to London to do all right for myself. Yeah, Right. And it's his whole family and it's a tale of, like, how, like his. How his man works dead hard and works loads of hours, but the kids are always well dressed and cleaned. It doesn't mean just because you haven't got a good job, you let your house run down. Do you know what I mean? She's looking after it. The. The sister, you know, she hasn't got new clothes, but they're always clean and her knees are clean, I think it says in one point. Excellent. Clean knees always important. So will we give it a listen? Brilliant. It's a great track. I think Stevie can do it justice after that explanation. Right, so I'm not sure this is. Like some sort of like, backing tune to try. Now try and pep it up a. Bit because you have really knocked it. The socks off. Brilliant. I'm looking forward to the Clean Ease. It's a new feature. What is it called again? The story in that song's really good. Here's Stevie Wonder. Go on. And Carl back announced that it's your. It's your choice that. Right. Songs with good stories that you can't. Fade out, although you can heavily edit them. Yeah, I noticed you didn't you. You didn't play the. The full version, which has obviously got the complete story in. You've You've just played a. I haven't heard the other. That's all I know. Well, in the album version he gets. He gets abducted as well. When he comes back with a big beard. Yeah. And he's covered in hair. No, he goes. He gets arrested and goes to jail. But it's. It's just, you know, it's just because he gets picked up because he's black. He hasn't done anything wrong. There's a whole other section. Maybe we should change this section. No, what we'll do. Right, Abridged versions of songs. Yeah. No, next week we'll play the second bit and it'll be like. Like Star wars or something like that. Brilliant. Doves Caught by the river on XFM 104.9. Well, it's been a good show, hasn't it? It's been sort of like what. Quite a rock and roll 70s feel to it. Mainly the equipment, but we got through it. Carl's been telling us some great insights into his. His mind, really. We've had a few laughs, a few tears. Bit stressful. What are you telling me in the week about when you went to visit your dad in hospital? Oh, we're talking about. Yeah. When I got back off holiday and my dad was. Was in hospital, I shot back to see him, see how he's getting on and hospitals are depressing places, aren't they, really? Like, God, you know. You know, if. Even if you're not that ill, it makes you feel worse. Yeah. Because it's really like. Drags you down. There's people walking around moaning, you know, you mainly. Nurses. Yeah. I would like to be the man. That get paid enough and all that. And I do, like. No, well, that's Tony Blair. Are you listening? I don't want to look like I'm moaning about the people working because they all work really hard. Yeah, yeah. But it's just hard, depressing places. High five. Yeah. Right. So. So I'm sat there, my dad's getting fed up and. Is that because you're visiting? Just. Just. It's quite an active bloke and all of a sudden he's got to stay in bed and, you know, it's like, sit down, stop moving about and all this. So. So he sat there and there's an old woman in the bed next door. Right. And she's. I mean, she's in. She's in a bad way anyway. Yeah, right. She must have been. She'd looked about. I'd say she looks about 98 or something. Like that. Okay, good. Right. Now, I don't know what was wrong with her, but she was always constantly moaning and you could see that the nurses were trying their best to keep her happy and she wasn't having any of it. And you know, she was moaning because. Because her hands had gone blue. Well, that is a worry, to be honest. Well, it's not because she's 98. Is that what happens? But why, why doesn't the doctor. If I was a doctor and I'm not one. No, Carl, don't be modest. Are you a doctor, yes or no? I think he's let it slip. Are you, Carl, are you a doctor? No. Listen, look me in the eye, right. So this woman had blue hands. Had she seen a spacecraft? Right, she had blue hands. Now she's 98. If I was a doctor. No, she's not 98. You said, you said earlier on she looked about like. So you're making that up. It's just shifted from speculation fact now. Yeah, yeah, she's 98. Year old woman. Yeah, yeah, go on. Yeah. If I was a doctor, I'd be thinking. You're not, are you? Honestly. I don't get away with this. I'd be thinking, right, she's 98, she hasn't got long left. Why not just let her be at home and be happy in her own space? Yeah. You know, and let her, let her have a nice life, whatever's left. Because she may hurt herself, she may have falls. Some people have to go in there for their own protection. She might not have immediate family, she. May not have been dragged in against her will. She may have come to hospital because she was worried about her blue hands. Yeah, yeah. But when I was talking to Ricky, he said, oh, what it would have been is probably a bit of. Did you say it's rheumatism or something? No, I said it might. I mean, a blueness can be through lack of circulation. Right? So just. And I've definitely got a doctor. You've got blue hands, bad circulation, we're going to send you home, we'll give you a Rubik's cube, play around with that with your hands. Get, get the blood, get the blood pumping and don't worry, I don't say, oh, it's really bad. Just think, she's 98, let her have a nice rest of the life. Yeah. But instead she was there. And the annoying thing was, and they do this with a lot of people in hospital, pump you with drugs, try to sort it out. They don't, you know, there's probably a bit of guesswork going on, maybe a little. Not as much as you, but go on. Right. And because of that they sort of break wind a lot. So I'm sat there with my dad talking. Drugs do that, Steve. I'm sure if there's a doctor listening or a nurse, they will clarify, right, that if they pump you with all sorts of stuff, it wants to come out, right? So you're sat there having a serious chat. It's a quiet hospital. The woman next door with the blue hands suddenly starts seeping gas, right? Well, I start laughing because if there's one thing that makes you laugh, it's. Like it's a 98 year old woman with blue hands. Fine. So you try to hold it in because it's a really quiet hospital and it's. It'd be obvious that, that I was laughing at her and I didn't want to be mean, but it was funny. And then it got me talking about me auntie because my auntie Nora, she, same thing, pumped her with loads of drugs. She used to have a cabinet next to the bed is like boots. She's got loads of stuff, right, for all sorts of stuff. And I mean, she's not that old, but she's on loads of stuff, right. She's a bit coked up. She called up my mum once, yeah. He told us this, go on, do it again. And she said, oh, how are you doing? And that's all right. Bit worried though. My mom said, why, what's up? Should have been breaking wind. So she goes, well, you know, she says, no, but this one is going on and on and on and she was like, she was, she was like, what, what, what do you say? What's like passing wind, farting for five minutes. One, one thing. Not like, you know, trumping. And then nothing. Yeah, Continuous. Continuous drone of a fart. Yeah, I don't think she had. How big was she? She must be the size of a barn. No, she's not that big. She's, you know, she's good for age. No, but I mean, no, for five minutes. Where's all the guy? Was she circular breathing? Was she sucking it in with her mouth? It was just. I don't know, I don't know that much about it, but she called up my mum about two and a half minutes in. Could you hear. Me, mama? And it went, it went on for a further two and a half minutes. Oh, and she just stayed on the phone, did she? Where was going? Can you hear that? Well, did she hold the phone Next to her ass. Listen to that. She was off the ground trying to. Work a tune down. She was, she was actually hovering. She was 4 foot off the ground when they found her. The ambulance man. The cat's dead. Don't light a match. Don't light that cigarette. Yeah, it's like that advert. The kids come home from school, switch on the light. Yeah. Then they see granny hovering. Turn the light on. Be careful. If you have an elderly woman at home. Yeah, Drugs make you fart. So that's, that's what I'm saying, you know, just let these people. What are you saying? What are you saying? I'm saying let people enjoy the life they've got left. No, you're not. You're saying, don't put me in hospital, leave my own to die. No, I'm not. Give him a Rubik's Cube and let him die. That's what he's saying. Yeah. I'll tell you something now, right, Steve, I'll tell you something. I didn't want to do it because it bring the show down, but she did die. Who, the blue handed lady? Yeah. How do you know? Because I said to me dad, how's the woman next door? She went, she went last night. They've got an old fellow in there now. So there you go. So wouldn't it have been better to leave her at home where her friends and family can call and speak to her, even nip that round if they want, you know, With a cat, I imagine. No, it's definitely a cat. Now what wasn't that cat's cold that you imagine? Probably I'm seeing like a big ginger one. So I don't know, something like, I don't know, maybe ginger, whatever. Maybe I had a budgie. But that's what I'm saying, just let him enjoy his life. Because dying in hospital, I wouldn't like to do it. If I went to the doctors and they said, you haven't got long life left, I'd say, well, I'll stay at home. Yeah. And that's, that's the point I'm getting at. Yeah, right. If you can't do anything for them, let him enjoy the life. Yeah, A Rubik's Cube. Right, well good. Backfired. Now let's play the second of the Rolling Stones track. I'll try and do this every week. It's a feature called Too Lazy to Go and Get Another Album. What about a classic bit of rock and roll? Yeah, I'd love to hear Brown Sugar. Do you know what this Is about Carl jokes. Maybe I'll tell you later. Well, stones, brown sugar. Steve thinks I can't tell you what this is about because it's too rude for radio, but you've done it again, haven't you? You've said another call, haven't you? Yeah, Just that drugs do make. You have wind, morphine, especially. Especially. That's. That's the. The bad one to have. And that was from a medical student, wasn't it? Yeah, up in Leeds. So cheers for that. Haven't had any calls about the alien abduction, funnily enough. No clarification on that so far. Keep you posted, though. Yeah, yeah, yeah. If anything happens, we will let you know. Yeah, yeah. Well, that's it. We got through it. With all these mistakes, they've got to get this equipment fixed and get. They've got to go to HMV Monday and buy about, I'd say, five to ten thousand pounds worth of new Arsenal. That's definitely, definitely. Get this fixed now. Get this fixed, definitely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't go on about that next week, though. We'll have more educating. That's the phone, look. That's the phone. Yeah, don't do that. What? Educating Ricky. We'll do the Quiz Rock Busters. Do that again. Right. I might not be here if that's the case. Steve. What? What have you got? What, next week? No, no, I'm just gonna bring some sandwiches. I. Do you notice I was quite quiet for the last 20 minutes? Yeah, just dozed off. Yeah, well, though the air conditioning's. I'm feeling quite muddy. That doesn't work either. And this is totally serious. I'm not joking. For the. It's. I mean, it's ridiculous. So write a song for the ladies to end with as ever sly in the family stone it's always a favorite if you want me to stay. See you next time. Cheers. Sweet.",
