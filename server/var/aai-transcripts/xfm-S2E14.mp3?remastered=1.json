  "text": "Red Hot chili peppers on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant. Hello there. Carl Pilkington. All right, don't be nervous. We. We might see a difference in car. He's a little bit shy. There's someone here from BBC filming this part of that celebrity boxing thing, the Fight, I think it's called. And they're. They want to get a little clip of this. So we're gonna let them film for a minute and then they're gonna go away. Is that all right, Carl? Yeah. He doesn't want. He doesn't want to be on camera. Do you? Do you? I think it ruins radio, doesn't it? Not for the people listening, it doesn't. Yeah, but it does because people are like, oh, he sounds like a bit of a looker. What are you? Yeah, and then they'll see it on the telly and they'll go, God, yeah. You know, his head is round. It is round, though, isn't it? So guess what? I got a call yesterday, you'll love this, Steve from mtv, and wondering if they could screen test Carl. That's outrageous. I'm loving it. And I was going, yeah. And I come. I said, yeah, yeah, it's fine. I come down with him. And I was saying, what about this? And that was low. Loving it. I called him. I went, oh, no. I went, why not? He went, well, I'm looking at my reflection now in the mirror. He said, I shouldn't be on the telly. What would you wear for your screen test, Carl? What kind of look would you try and cultivate? Because you've got to bear in mind that the audience out there, they don't know what you look like. So would you be a snappy dresser, like, say, Jonathan Ross? Or would you go for your kind of street cash look? Wear a suit. You can't wear a suit. Don't hold it. Well, so I'm thinking, I don't know, I'll probably wear me woolly hat because that takes some years off me. It does. He looks about 10 with a woolly hat on. Yeah. Okay. Is it quite a cool woolly hat or has it got a bobble? Charcoal? I'd say it's the in. In colour. Yeah, okay. And I'll probably wear me anorak. Right. Oh, he's going for. There. He's going for gram. He's going for quite a gram look. Oh, dressed for a jumble sale. Wow. Yeah, I'm not that happy about it all, to be honest. Are you gonna do it? You're not gonna do it? Well, I'm sort of stuck in the middle because throughout my life so far, I've always just. I've never planned for anything. Right. It's just always happened. Yeah, yeah. The time, you know, I mean, being in plays at school. Never planned it. But when I did it, I went down a store. It was a trial. Yeah, we all remember that. So we. As I remember, you did Little Donkey. Did a little Donkey, yeah. And then later, someone was filming at the back. Was it your dad's mate? My dad's mate, yeah. And on the camcorder, he listened back, watched him playing. Dad says just off camera, what does he say? I don't want to say it because I'm in charge of the show and be irresponsible. He looks like a right twat. And so he gets home just watching that, and then here's his dad just off camera. Go. He looks like a right twat. All right, yeah. What are you worried about your dad? Can I just interject? Because I'm really worried about this idea of Carl being on mtv. Because the problem is that, you know, let's be honest, Rick, I mean, we're. We're getting by the skin of our teeth, aren't we, really? It's only Carl that's keeping this afloat. Yeah. And if he gets on MTV and the world sort of gets a sense of him and they understand him and he. He won't be ours anymore. We won't be able to control him. He'll be out there. Well, that's. That's the thing. No, that's the thing. That's the terrible thing, though, isn't it? It's like Carl is my pet, but I realize I've got to release him into the wilder. And, you know, because I love him, I know he's got to go free, sure. But I wanna. Kez, maybe someone. I'd beat him to death and we won't have to worry. I'll have you on, though. I'll have you on as a guest. Which gets me on to something we've got coming up today. Oh, yeah, he's got a new idea. Yeah, right. Do you know, like, I've talked about ghosts and we had that good discussion the other week, walking to Giddily Circus Station. Yeah. And I was telling you about ghost, and you were saying, carl, don't be an idiot and all that. Spoke to a woman in the week, done a little interview with her. You've done an Italy interview, Done a. Little interview, two minutes or so with. With a woman who's. Who's got ghosts in her house. So I look forward to hearing that later. That sounds great. Coming up later. Well, I'm gonna play a classic tune now. I've just gone straight forward. I've gone for the jugular. This is Ziggy Stardust by David Bowie, Siggy Stardust by David Bow and XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais, with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkerton. Carl's also nervous. Got a bit of shock last week, didn't you? Just a little bit. His. His dad tuned in to the show. Yeah. And Carl's never told him that he actually speaks on the show. He just said, I'll just press the buttons. Right. He's kept him from it. He used to do radio before and you told him, did you? It's because the little donkey incident. Yeah, when he went along. So Was that the 20th incident? Yeah, yeah. And so he's never told him since. But. But they promised not to listen, haven't they? Well, my dad said. My mom said to me, don't worry, don't be put off this week because, you know, I've told him he can't listen. But I hear my dad in the background kind of going, oh, look. So he might be listening. So that's extra pressure. Lots of camera crew in. I know you don't like it. This is good training for mtv because then he can watch you on tv. And what's he gonna make of that? Oh, yeah. Does he know you're bald? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't keep you out on. When you're with him and say, oh, no, I just press the buttons. No, it's just. It's just, you know, it's like when. When I was in any plays, I didn't tell him no. Any sort of parents evening. I never gave him the note. Really. So what did the teachers think? You were just an orphan? No, just on an off chance, my mate's dad spoke to me dad once, I think, and sort of said, oh, you got a school to see how you know your kid's doing. Is that what you're talking about? So there's a parents evening. So he said, what kid? He went to one. And that's when Mrs. Matthews said I'd never be a high flyer. How wrong was she? I think we should call Mrs. Matthews and make her eat her words. Well, ah, she'd turn onto mtv when. I don't know that, like their. Their slamming Session. Yeah. And they're gonna go, that's young Pilkington. He's bald, but it's definitely him. I recognize that willy hat. Yeah. Did you see Celebr Celebrity Fit Club yesterday? I missed it. I didn't watch any TV this week. The only what TV I watched was, are you good in bed? I already knew the answer. You had to have to take points. Yeah, yeah, right. It was. No, I was off the scale. Well, talking off the scales, Rick Waller, really. Yeah. Well, what he did is he lost. He lost weight and they couldn't believe it. And he had a big argument with Harvey and they said, go, Never come back to it. Right. And then he got to Wayne and he'd lost sort of like ten pounds or something. And they were really. They said, you've been starving yourself, haven't you? And he admitted it. And he just wasn't wearing his underpants. Yeah, yeah, but. But it was whinging all the time. It wasn't. He was doing a press that was going, I've hurt my arm. They was going, I feel sick. And he was going. And he was just lying all the time about whether he was doing the routine and what about what he was eating and stuff. And I thought, that's me. It is, because it's sort of like. And they go, how's it going? Do you have another drink this week? I'm gonna go, no. Haven't had a beer this week. No. Did you do the exercise day? And I go, yep, yeah, I've done all that. Done all that, done all that. And I try and get out the sparring because it hurts, because there's a man hitting me in the face for fun. Because, you know, that's what boxing is. Yeah, I like all that. I like all the bits except the being here. I don't even mind hitting someone. Right. I'd be willing to hit someone. It's the getting hit that I don't. Like, because I know you're a big fan of, like, wearing the clothes, the sort of sporty gear. You look good. And you've obviously switched. They've given. No, no, I gave it free of charge. This was free training. That's a perk you love. And I know you like kind of the. The sort of various sort of nutritional drinks you've got. I know you're a big fan of those. I love the protein shake because it tastes like chocolate. You know what? I've put on a couple of pounds since I've been doing this training. I think it is the extra meal. And so you're adding the protein but not working out enough to take it off again. Yeah, but I think I've. I have actually changed a bit. I've got an inch on my chest, but. Inch off my waist. So even though I've put on weight, there must be a little bit of muscle happening somewhere. So I just. Just to recap that you're. You're enjoying all the trappings of boxing. Yeah, but not the boxing, not the. Getting hit in the nose. Right, that's the one. And you are aware that that's what will. What. What will be happening during the action. Because I've got a cunning plan. Okay. I'm gonna duck and die. Yeah. I'm bob and weave. Dance. I'm gonna dance. Well, I read in the paper. Yes. I don't know how much truth there is, that Grant Bovey has recruited celebrity hypnotist Paul McKenna to help him win. Yeah. So I don't know if that's a finish, because I know you've got. Haven't you got Berm, you've got Spit the Dog, a couple of ventriloquists and the impressionist on your side. I've got Pork Boy from Desmond. Exactly. Just getting me cheering your corner, mentally. Yeah, well, I don't know. It's all a bit of fun. What do you reckon, Carl? What do you think he said? What's McKenna going to be doing? Is like Grant Bowie gonna be turned into a chicken and he's gonna do an Elvis impression. Yeah. If I say the right words. No, I think it's probably. He's probably gonna just have cushion. Yeah. I think there's lots of sports psychologists out there at the moment getting people. So I'm sure it's. I'm sure it's valid if it's true. I'm sure it's fine. But I've been. I've been. I've been getting tuned mentally, learning how to hit. Yeah, that was my method. Eating and hitting, I think, is. And do you work out to any music? I mean, do you put on the Rocky soundtrack? Because I know you've got CD with all. With music from the. All five films, haven't you? No, we don't. It's all. It's. I think I have the radio on down there, but you don't hear it. It's all you hear is people shouting, saying things like, that's not like a fighter. And me going, I'm not a fighter, I'm a comedian. And is it quite intimidating down there? I mean, do they. Yeah, I'm sure they're nice people, but. I'm getting used to it now. But it is. It is a different world. And I was quite scared and I didn't. When you say. I mean, is it like. Is it like they're gangsters? I mean, is it kind of. I just mean, has it got that feel, you know, when you see it in films? They walk into those places and, you know, they're kind of. They're hard nuts. And there's that feel like. Well, they're. I mean, they're all. You know, they're all X boxes and stuff, so. Yeah. I mean. But no, they're not. No, that's not. That's not. I mean, I suppose it's like they're real men. Well, yeah, and they. They don't understand, really, that I'm. I don't like getting hit on the nose. And they say, well, no one gets hit on the nose. And it took me a long time to get over that. Just. Just taking a couple of punches. I wanted to rule it out and. But, you know, it's okay now. And of course, they're. I know they're Molly coddling me. They're not. They're using about 25% power, and I'm still. And you wear the head gear. Oh, yeah, yeah. And the gum shield. Yeah. I wanted to wear a crash helmet, but they said no and carry a baseball bat and they said that's. That's technically illegal. But I'm looking for. I'm a changed man. Carl. What we got coming up? Got a bit of a Death in Vegas with vocals from Liam Gallagher. Final question for you, Rick. Do you think you'll carry on boxing. After this is finished competitively? No, no, no, just the training and stuff. Yeah, I love that. I love the training. I love learning the skills, and I do enjoy the training. I don't. I don't relish getting punched around and I'm not worried about the fight at all. I'm really looking forward to the. The fight because Grant's a novice like me. It's just when you get in with an ex pro who, you know, could destroy you anyway, so you're scared to never lose their rag. And they're really cool and they're really nice and they've never. They've never even hit me by mistake. But even just tapping you like that in the face hurts. I just. I was walking down Finchley radio and a couple of six former said, oh, you lanky gog light freak. And I just wondered if Maybe you could pop around and have a word with them. Yeah, I will. Some of your friends, yeah. An enemy of yours is an enemy of mine. Scorpio Rising, Death In Vegas and XFM 104.9. Steve. I'm Ricky Gervais. Carl. Carl's a little bit more. Less stressed now. There's a camera crew have gone. His dad's not listening, we think. Yeah. Who knows? But you're chilled. I'll tell you what, though. Me, my mum was loving it. Do you know Rock Busters? I love. What do I know? Robusters. She was taking part. I mean, she doesn't know a lot of the new bands and that, but she. She made some up for some older bands and that. Oh, she did some herself. She made some herself. Sent them in the post. So are you going to use those today? She's not quite got the hang of it. Unlike. Unlike a genius. Son, have you got them there? Can we hear what they are? You keep talking a second, then. I'm quite excited. I mean, if they're. If they're even approaching, say, the genius of Wet Knee. Houston. Yeah, yeah. There was another one which was something to do with a trench. Carl, what was that? Oh, that was Dandy Warhol's. That was a good one. Dandy Warhol. I think that was his. That was his finest moment. Yeah. Incidentally, I've got an email here from someone called Sauda, if that's a he or she. But let's assume it's a she, just for glam's sake, yeah? She said she saw an old man eating a Twix last week, Carl. So that blows your theory at the moment. I'm not having it. Okay, so if you are a bloke, he's calling you a liar. So maybe you want a little rumble later. In fact, if you are a bloke, he's calling you a girl. Yeah, exactly. Right, yeah. Then these are ones that my mum's made up. Brilliant. Right. Just in case you're a new listener, I give some initials out and a cryptic clue and it makes up a band, doesn't it? Or a solo artist. Not so much cryptic as what you're thinking. My mum sent this one. This group would be good at doing your hair. This group would be good at doing your hair. TP. Is there a group called the Hairdressers from the 60s? TP. TP. TP. Is it the something? The Platters. The Platters, yeah. That's all right. That's all right. Let's have a look. This group Sound like dinosaurs. Could be. Sound like dinosaurs. T. Rex. T. Rex. Yeah, I see what you mean. They're not so much cryptic, are they, this group. Leave her alone. They're good. This group likes being by the sand and the sea. They're the Beach Boys. This band are called the Beatles. We just have. Just have a. What else you got? It's funny, because one of them that she's done, I'm actually doing today. I thought of in the week. Right. Is it the same clue it was? Yeah. Wow. Great minds think alike. There's a last one from a. This guy sounds superb. This guy sounds superb. The Bachelors. Glenn Campbell. I like that. I think I'd say this. I think you should get onto one of the big game organizations, Parker Brothers or whatever, because this has got to be. I mean, this could sweep the nation at Christmas. Don't you think this is the perfect Christmas game? Yeah. I think this is what's going to make or break the MTV thing, right? Some kind of TV version. Yeah. I'm just thinking into our breaks, you know. Coming up next is this band. Be careful, though, Carl, because, you know, make sure you retain the rights. Because I can see this selling abroad. Yeah. And I can see someone coming along and taking the. Sort of like the. The Rock Busters and changing one word and making another name, like another game out of it and just using the same format. I know. I don't know. I can't think of them ever. They could change. Sort of like they change the word rock to something else and have it. What could it be? Brick block. Yeah. And so you have to do what. I mean, so be careful. Blockbusters will never work. Look at his little face. So. So, yeah, so we're doing that later. Got some good prizes. Okay, we'll talk about the prizes. Yeah. Educating Ricky. Yeah. We've got the woman who's got a ghost in a house. Yep. It's a shame she's not here live because I feel like I want to ask a few questions. Rick, I don't know about you. Don't worry. I've covered it all. You've covered it all? Yeah. So, yeah. Play a record. Rick. I know probably you, like me, are just too busy, really, to keep abreast of new music. Aren't you busy people. We've got, you know, important showbiz pirates to go to and stuff. That's why I have friends of mine who send me compilations and stuff. That's one of my quarterly compilations from my friend Harry. And that's all downhill from here. By Jim O'Rourke. I've got a new track coming up later, actually, that I think you might like. So, you know, we're, we're. We're inflaming each other's desire for new songs as well as going back to the back catalog some classics. Sure, sure. All right. I love adverts better, though. I do. I love. It's weird. Missy Elliott on XFM 104.9 Okie Gervais with me, Steve and Carl. Carl, why have you got headache? You got headache? Just a bit stressful because the moves. Moves on this this week. Are you living age? Oh, by the way, the exitm listeners came around to me house and bought the food on a table. Did they. Were they happy with it? Quite normal. They were well happy, yeah. Couldn't believe the luck with it. Quite normal? What do you mean, quite normal? Well, it sounds a bit scared and it getting. Getting people around. I imagine they were scared and were. They excited to see you? Could they? I mean, they were, you know. Could you tell that they were pretty pleased to see you? No, I don't think so. I mean, Pilkington. Yeah, but I. The fellas sort of. I mean, they brought the whole family round, which was a bit odd. Well, it's not often they get the chance to visit a living freak. Anyway, anyway, they were nice and you're moving now. He said. He phoned me up today, you know, it was absolutely tipping it down. He had to cycle in, right, because he said. Because the movie doesn't want to leave his bike around there. And he said, suzanne. Oh, I can't say this in case he's listening, can I? He won't know. Suzanne's hired the oldest removal man in London. You should hear him. And the thing is, right, and we booked him because everyone else happened to be booked out, but this fella's free. All right, so he called up this morning. I've never spoke to him, but he was on the phone. He sounded about 90. Yeah. I can't think that he's gonna have to do all the work. And the thing is. Well, it seems he only wanted some. Were the originals. Yeah, Listen, he seemed to be cheap because it's 50 pound an hour. But. How long is it going to take him? Yeah. When's the move on, then? Wednesday. He's coming, Right. He came around today to bring some empty boxes and he was struggling with them. So it actually happens on Wednesday. Oh, God. Anyway, so it's that you were laughing. And almost had a heart attack. Doesn't bode well, for the boxing cough at the moment. And I. I've had me lemz it anyway. What we doing there, Carl? Well, I teased you with it before. You gonna get it out again? I. I'm always, like, trying to get you, you know, thinking open and opening your mind up a bit to ghosts and stuff. Yes. So this woman who I know, she. She said she'd come in and I could interview her to try and sort of, you know, get the belief out there. Okay. So there's not enough belief in the occult and rubbish out there. So does she. She think she has a ghost? She has. Yes, she has. No, it's fact. Yes. Yes. So I thought maybe it's a new feature. We could try for a couple of weeks, see how it goes down, you know. You know, Parkinson. What about Pilkington? Welcome to Pilkington. Thank you. My guest today is Taryn. She's a plugger. You still a plugger, right? No. Do co management. Right? She does co management, but she was a plugger. She looked after therapy, Raging Speed on Slash, all the big names. Yeah. But we're not here to talk about music today. We do a lot of that on XFM today. We're talking ghosts now. Ricky and Steve, who do the show with, they. They're not having any of it. So I said, well, I know someone who, you know, gets on with ghost, does a lot of them. So I thought I'd get you in today, have a little chat for a couple of minutes just to sum up the story so they get an idea of what happened. You had a horse. Yeah. You had it in some stables. He hasn't let us speak yet. You went to, like, look after it and that, play around with it, take it for a ride. Yeah. Two of your mates were in the stable where your horses. Not my stable. In the opposite stable. In the opposite stable. And I heard them giggling. They're messing about on that. Yeah. You hear them having a laugh. So you thought, right, what are they up to? So you go in and they're messing about with the Ouija board. Yeah. Right. So this is where you come in. Did you get involved with the Ouija board? Unfortunately, I did. Right. And what happened then? Then I was like, oh, you don't believe in this? Oh, let me have a go. Right. And ask a few questions, put our hands on. And it actually started moving. So a lot of the stuff you asked it is that. Did the things happen? Yes, they did. So that's scary for a start. Right. We haven't even got to the ghost bit yet. So you mess about. Trap soul. Yeah, I like to call it trap soul. So you're messing about on the Ouija board, you say, right, I've had enough of this now. Yeah. I've got all the answers I need. Yeah. You go home. I didn't like them. You go in the house and it's a bit nippy. The house. The flat is absolutely fine. Is when I went into the bedroom. You've got to remember it's a very, very warm, hot evening. Right. And walk into the bedroom and no note. It is cold. Colder than usual. But I'm actually quite glad because it's so hot. Right, okay. Completely ignored the fact that the windows were all shut, but the curtains were blowing. Didn't sleep well at all. Right. Next evening, same again. Freezing, yeah. Very, very noticeably cold. Curtains blowing. Yeah. I'm fast asleep. Get woken up, the wardrobe's opening. So at this point, this is where we clear up. You're not. You're not on crack, you know. Never touched drugs in my entire life. You're not a drinker. No. I would have the old glass of red wine. Yeah, right, That's. That's all right. They recommend that anyway. They say it's good for your art. What started happening was as the week progressed, I also felt the bed covers at one point at night, fold over, double bed. The bed covers fold over and it was like someone was getting in the bed next to me. But you gotta remember when you're in a deep sleep, you're not quite thinking and you're thinking, I'm losing it. I was getting more and more tired, more and more a little stressed. I'm really thinking I was having a breakdown. The final straw was when the clothes on the end of my bed that I just throw hit me. How come you were going back home at night? Because I was skeptical. In fact, six months ago, I just said, I don't want to go there. People will think I'm mad. But you know what? I don't care. Yeah, I know there's more out there. Well, brilliant. Well, cheers for that. And thanks for being a guest on. On Pilkington. Incisive investigative journalism there. I like the fact that you've learned a lot from Parkinson, even stealing some of his questions. Like, are you on crack? He always asks his guests. Yeah, yeah. I like the fact that when she went, I didn't. I have the occasion. That's all right for you. Good for your art. That was great. It was brilliant. That is the best interview technique. I've ever heard anywhere. I feel like there's still some questions unanswered. Yeah. It hasn't proved it to me. I'll be honest, PAL hasn't proven the existence of. Of ghosts. I was. I was worried as soon as she got involved with the Ouija board. Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking, please do not get involved. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was worried when I said I heard some giggling from coming from the other stable. Yeah. Don't go over there. What questions did she ask the Ouija board? You didn't ask that. I noticed. She didn't. She didn't. She didn't want to say. No. Okay. Do you think it was something like why that you did. To try and confuse the computer and the spirit world got really annoyed and they got confused and they came back and started messing up her clothes. But what. What do you think then? What do you mean? What do you mean, what do I think? What do you think? What about what? What? There's. There's nothing I can answer there. There's nothing I can answer. All right. She said, well, I just keep saying I don't believe in the existence of ghosts because of the impossibility, right? Now, when she said, I mean, the interview I did for 50 minutes. You did for how long? 50 minutes? 55 minutes. Yeah. We might use that. Christmas or something. Right. But the thing is. Well, that's the best you got out of 50. Yeah. MTV are not gonna call again. I'll tell you what, right. It did get a bit dark and I didn't want. I didn't want that. But I can. I can understand the heating thing. I said, well, you know, in the full interview, I was saying, you know, that could. That could be anything. Could it heat and broke or something. Now, she said that the. What else was she talking about? Someone got into the bed next to her. Yeah. I mean, I sort of said, well, you know, how did that happen? Yeah, she couldn't explain it herself, but I said, but it did wake you up. Maybe you're a little bit sort of. Although the only explanation I can think of if she didn't actually see anyone is whether it was a ghost. Yeah, that one's probably got a ghost. What about cupboards? Opening and shutting? See, that's again, the only explanation for that is a ghost. Yeah. Anything else? Play a record. It's got to be a ghost. It is ghost. I think you've proven it to us. Yeah. Spirit. Street spirit. Yeah, nice. Street spirit. Radiohead. So, turns out ghosts do exist after all. Steve. A woman. What? Carl Knows proved it. I've got egg on my. Yep. On xfm. I should just encourage you and everyone else listening. I've got egg on my face that we're gonna say. I've just been eating an omelette. James. Randy, a hero of yours and a hero of mine. He's on TV this week on Horizon. I think it's maybe Thursday. Check press for details. Trying to expose the nonsense that is homeopathy. Oh, yeah, I saw that. Yeah, I look forward to that. Do you know what that is, Carl? Oh, go on. They've got a theory that if you say. Say you got something. An essential oil or something, or in a solution, 1 in 10 solution, and it does something to you, actually does something to you. They've got this thing where they dilute it. Dilute it to. So there's nothing in it. But because they're using the same water on the. The dilute, the water still has the same effect. It's sort of like. It's sort of like a placebo that, you know, works. You know, that's the sort of theory of it. What time's that on? Check the papers. But I think it's sort of 9:00, Thursday, something like that. It'll be interesting, though, Carl. It will be interesting, mate, trust me. I'll tell you what's also interesting, Rick. The prizes were given away this week on Rockbusters. We got for you David Attenborough's the Life Of Mammals. I don't know, is this a new show? Is this on TV at the moment? Is this like a double VHS thing there? We've also got a U2, the best of their 90s videos. Even better than the real things on there. Mysterious Ways, Beautiful Day, Electrical Storm, the new one. Stuff on there that's on video. We've also got a couple of CDs. The Smashing Pumpkins, I think this is sort of alternative versions of a lot of their hits and stuff, live versions and stuff like this. Johnny Cash's current album, possibly his last, we don't know because apparently he's not very well at the moment. So an album of covers? Yeah, well, not all covers. Some of his new stuff as well, but he's done covers of things like Personal Jesus by Depeche Mode and Desperado and Bridge Over Troubled Water. And the great thing about Cash is I read an amazing review where it says it's like he always makes them his own. Do you know what I mean? It's like you can't even remember the old version. Desperado by the Eagles. By the Eagles, yeah. I'd like to play that. Yeah, because I haven't heard that. We'll play that and then give it away. These are actually good prizes we've also. Got, including a small miniature three wheel car and only Fools and Horses video. I think this is the special that was on Christmas TV last year. So if you're one of the. The people who didn't see it, I mean, wasn't it like 22 million people watching us? If you're one of the people who, you know, desperately wants to see it again. I know I do. And wants a small yellow car, then. Then there is. And also another of these compilations, arbitrary compilation albums. The best chill out album ever, Rick. Sure, if you're a fan of the Levi's Freedom ad. Freedom, then the track that. I hate the music to it though. No. Well, that's a shame because how much do you love the Volvo TV ever? Love it. Love it. Because that's the music again though. Why that's a shame because. Oh, okay, sure, sure. There's also stuff on here. There's some interesting stuff. There's Pink Floyd, there's Coldplay, there's Roy Scott. So, you know, it's probably worth it. I love Pink Floyd. Except the music again, for me, that's. A whole heap of treats. And that's the winner of Rockbuster coming up after the adverts. Okay. Doves caught by the river on XFM 104.9 into the second hour. Now this is when this award winning show really kicks into gear. When you say award winning. We haven't won them yet. I mean, we will win time. Hang on, let me remind you, wasn't there a broader bonds in the Sony Awards? No, it doesn't count. Doesn't count. I'm Ricky. Ray's obviously with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Which is what heat right about really. Carl's the main man. Think of Carl a year ago. He was just sitting in that room going, all right, all right, I've done this xfm. It's good. Yeah, it's like a music bed. Brilliant comes on the show, we start taking the piss out of him. People start going, oh, it was the idiot you've got in. We go, is Carl. And they go, we like him. He said, he's a fool. I go, yes, he's a fool. He's a pet buffoon. And I go, we'll let him speak more. Right. And they're going, don't let him talk. Don't let xfm, the. The Fat Cats. Oh. And I said, I'm a rebel and I do it my way. Did you stick it to the man? Yeah, yeah. And then MTV call up. Yeah. He writing about him every week. Yeah. He's just been doing film for the BBC. There's some rumors he might be the new James Bond. Yeah, yeah. He's got his. He's got. Is he in lovely McVitty's original digestives? Are we allowed to. Can I. If McVit is a listening. I love these biscuits. Yeah. And. And he's got the best. If the Spearmint Rhino strip clubs are listening, I'm a huge fan. Right. And he's got Rockbusters to come. Yes. The few people have asked me this and there's also an email here from. Rich people are saying they've seen some of the posters and the adverts of advertising the show, plugging the show. Why isn't your. Why aren't you on the posters, Carl? And it is your choice, isn't it? We did ask Carl to be involved. Well, he is, actually. It's like, Where's Waldo? He's actually. He's in my trousers. You don't want. You don't. You don't. You're not seeking the publicity. I reckon you are, secretly. I don't believe. No, he's right. He's totally right. He's doing it just right. But I think there's a. There's a fine line to be drawn that, you know, if you like being in, you know, around radio, you've got. And you want your own show or you enjoy talking and they just happen to be filming you for mtv. That's different. I think what you just avoid is going to silly celebrity bashes, having your picture taken for the sake of it. It. I mean, I think you're right, but I think you should do the screen test. On a serious note, I think you should do the screen test just because it might be fun and if it's no good, they won't do it. And you can stop anytime you want. No one has to keep going on telly. I just think we're going to lose him. No, we won't lose him. Listen, right, I'll always be part of this. I just worry that you're going to get. You're going to exhaust yourself. You're going to be drained. You're going to have told all your anecdotes. If you have to help the old fellow upstairs with a bed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. £50 an hour. Oh, go on. But what I wanted to do, right, because I don't want to embarrass myself, right, I don't want to embarrass the woman at MTV when I turn up and she thinks, oh, look at him. Yeah, what a waste of film this is going to be. Because it's not cheap. I know it's not film either, but. Go on. Well, it is cheap. It is cheap. They're filming on a DV camera that they can go over. If it's no good, they won't show it to anyone. It'll be great. It's just what they want. You. Honestly, I can just see you doing little things, just like popping up, up, you know, between the records and going, all right, MTV Music Television. Hear about the airy Chinese kid born. Which is weird, isn't it? Because they're not usually airy. It just goes, mtv. It'd be brilliant. It'd be brilliant. Carl, if. I'll come down with you, I'll come down with you. Well, we'll see. Go on, we'll think about it. Right, Right. Rockwesters. So Rockbusters. We, you know, it's a little clue, some initials, three different want clues. You email in ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk you can win the. The load of stuff that we've got. So first one, here's the clue. Stop throwing that fruit about. Oh, what's the initial? That's cb. Cb. Cb. Stop throwing that fruit about. Yeah, all right. Is and is listening. Has he emailed us in here and. There'S not any response from Andrews. I'll keep. Maybe he hasn't stopped listening because he doesn't like the show. He's gone off. I. Has gone off the show. So the second one, that Scottish fellow has made an error. That Scottish fella has made an error. Yeah, that's interesting. That's M. M. Right. That Scottish fellow has made an error. Right. And the last one. God, you can make a right load of toast with them. You can make a right load of toast with them. Yeah, all right. That's G. G. I was thinking it might be bread for a minute, but no, so. So just very quickly stop throwing that fruit about. Cb. I've got the last one. Right. Scottish. Doesn't work. It doesn't count. Doesn't count. Well, that Scottish fellas made an error. That's M. And God, you can make a right load of toast with them. That's g. Email in ricky.gervais xlm.co.uk and you can. We've got the CDs, we've got horses, we got mammals on video chest. We got you two, we got a couple of CDs, including Johnny Cash. Here's a new tune from a. A new fella called Papa Garcia. See what you think of this. See, if he was on mtv, I couldn't say his name. Why, what is it again? Papa Garcia. Right, here's a new one from Papa Garcia. Brilliant. Papa Garcia, Natalie and Nussi from the forthcoming album Bring Me the Head of Papa Garcia. Catchy, that. Quite retro. Bit of a bit of out on John and all sorts through. Yeah, lovely. Right, here we go. Quick clues again and then we better do Educating Ricky. This is the favourite bit of the show for me now. Educating Ricky. I love it. I can't. Well, yeah, I'm anxious all week. Well, just quick, quickly on those clues, just in case people need to know again, stop throwing that fruit about. Cb that Scottish fellas made a bit of an error. M. And God, you can make loads of toasts with them. That's G. Ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk it's email only. Oh, I need some learning. I need some knowledge. Carl, educate me. Might be able to help you. Go on. We've got three things. As always, I give them a little heading to tease you as to which one you want to learn first. Yeah. First one is. Is the tip included? Is the tip included? Like it? Second one. I want to come here in hindsight. I wouldn't have come here in hindsight. Yeah. Okay. And the third one. How am I gonna have to thump you? How am I gonna have to thump you? Okay. What, the Internet. So. So if I can get into the mindset of this plan. Is the tip included? Well, obviously that's probably not going to be about a way. It's going to be like, is that if that's someone losing the end of his knob, I assume armor Gonna have to thump you. That's a man who lost his arm in a fight, but then picked it up with the other arm and smacked him with it. What was the middle one? I want to come here in hindsight. Hindsight. Hind. Hindsight. Yeah, yeah. Someone was blinded by baked beans. So what are you going for then? I think I better go for armor. Gonna have to thump you. All right, well, this isn't. I've been struggling again, to be honest with you, searching Iron Low for stuff and. And some of these I had to leave till this morning. Right. Because there's just not enough knowledge out in the world, is there? Just you don't know about. I found out about something in the week about a guy who was playing tug of war. This is bonus material. His arm came off. He's only. His arm. Come on. Yeah, he got caught up in the rope. Yeah. No, no, he didn't. He didn't get caught up in the rope. He just was trying that hard and didn't want to lose. He kept holding. He allowed his arm to be pulled off. Off. He really wanted to win. The other team pulled it and his arm come off. No. Well, I don't know who to believe. Well, think about it. If he's gripping. Yeah. As soon as there's tension like this, the, the arm coming out of the socket, the hand might release. I think his arm got caught up in the rope and so it was involuntary as opposed to him going, well, my arm's coming off. I'm not going to lose this. You might be right. That's the fact. That's a bonus. That's a bonus fact. Yeah, that's educated me well. A man lost his arm. Oh, interesting. Go on. Oh my. Gonna have to thump you. Do you know the saying shut your face? Yeah, I've heard the well known Shakespeare in it. Do you know how it came about? No. Joe Dolce. It's ages ago. Oh yeah, Literally. Literally. Like knights who wore armor. Okay. That's arma going after something, you know, that's how it came about. Okay. Armor. They, they wore all the stuff and they had the helmet and safety, the guarding something at night. Stood outside a castle or something. Yeah. And it's probably going to be two of them. Right. So they stood there talking and that and talk about stuff and the future. Yeah, Medieval stuff. One of them, one of them was like, oh, we should shut up. You know, I've been stood here for hours and he's going on and on. Yeah, sure. So he'd say shut your face, meaning shut the guard down on your helmet, the visor and I can't hear you then, so shoot your face. Shut your face. That's how it came about. It would be interesting if I could just rely on it. I'm not sure it's true. I know, I just, just never know I can. It needs to be cooperated. It's like, I don't know where he got it from, but anything via Carl is precarious. Yeah, I mean, I feel like maybe you should give us your sources next. Time, you know, tell us got off the Internet. Yeah, but where on the Internet? I can't remember where that one. I Mean, I always go through, like, the news pages and stuff and I. This news should be updated because they've only reached the 17th century, which is last week with people eating tomatoes on lead planes. I look at news and there was stuff about a woman who was in a shop and she. I don't know, some. They had some workman in. Workmen in, doing the shop up and they had some wood glue left out and she asked for some pear juice and then the guy went and thought the glue in the thing was the pear juice and she went and drank that. But that's not really news. No. So I thought, well, we're not here. I wish you hadn't told us there was one about. So there's some poor woman now whose ties of tiles have fallen off because she tried to put them up with bear juice. Yeah. See, that's the. That's the danger of mixing up pear juice with toxic glue. Your wallpaper and your tiles and everything just fall down. Be careful, everyone. Be careful. There's something about kids having hamburgers. It makes them fat. Hold on, what you having Food with high fat content can make you put on weight. Yeah. Don't believe it. You're an idiot. What's the next one? No, let's play tune. Let's play tune. You've still got to come. You've still got. I want to come here. In hindsight. And you've still got. Is a tip included. But we've got a bit of. Well, I think we haven't played anything for a while, have we? In terms of the Hip Hop Hooray feature that I used to be so popular for. So I thought we'd just resurrect that for one week. Only Pete didn't pick up on that one. Let me just remind you. Hip Hop Hooray was where I played. A hip hop track and then I said, hooray or. Yeah, well, no, no, I didn't even know that. Brilliant. That's a great thing, though. We could add that in. We could phase that in maybe at the end of the song. Brilliant. Brilliant. Check it. Call lil Cs. Tell that. Bring me some featuring Puff Daddy and Little Kim. That's notorious. Big. Brilliant. Notorious. Great. Lovely. Carl just said to me, ar is something you can't hold your breath to death. Have you tried it, Carl? Just another little lesson. Someone here who's in a really low F, they listening to a show, they. Were going to commit suicide. What did you learn in the week? Right. I'm always doing all the educating. I asked you you were talking about watching a program about jellyfish. Yeah. And I said, well, that'll be interesting. I'll try and find some stuff out. But I couldn't find anything that I didn't already know about them. It must be difficult for you to find anything you don't already know. So what. What did you learn about jellyfish? I agreed with you by the end of it that they should be wiped off. Off the face of the Earth because they're balls of water in membrane, right, that go around stinging people to death. Let's lose them, Carl. Let's lose the jellyfish. Yeah, that's what I think, because I was stung by one, you know. You got stunned by one? Yeah. Stung by one. Yeah. And I don't understand. I'm not a fan of them. That's that good. Sorted out the jellyfish, kind of. We've solved that particular worry. All right, then. So take your pick then. I asked him if he could have any animal the other day. Did I ask him on air as well? Don't know. Off air. He said, I've got it down to two, right? And this was. He said. He said, what a favorite animal looking at? Or could I own one? And I went, you could own one. And he went, right, but could I own one? Or whatever. I have trouble. Wait, Carl, you've got all the expertise. You can just have it in whatever it needs. And you're going on there. Went, right, that and I won't regret it and get fed up. Said, no, Carl, just what animal? If you could have any animal. What animals? I've got another two. I went, what is it? He said, either the rhino or the hippo. What's your logic? Well, I don't know that that was then. I mean, ask me tomorrow. I might have two other favorites. Do you know what I mean? When was that? A couple of weeks ago. When was that? You were there. Yeah, but, you know, what are they today? Quickly now. First animal comes in. Quickly now. Any animal I want, you can have. Any animal in the world. World. One that's maybe extinct. Anything you want, right. I might have. Am I. Just for today. Just for today, I might have a scorpion in a little box. A little scorpion in a box. What's your thinking? It's the chimp every time. It's the chimpanzee or the gorilla. No, but if I tell you that program about the scorpion, how they all help each other out. Right? Scorpions all help each other out. No, no, this is brilliant. Right? Somewhere in the desert. Okay, in the desert. It's like these little monkeys that are underground or something. And there's these holes. Is this Beneath the Planet of the Apes? The fourth in the series. No, and you've got it wrong. Anyway, they're not monkeys. There's little monkeys under the go. What are they doing then? They're toiling into underground mines. They're lizards, if you remember. And the lizard goes to sleep and the bloke comes along. You've told this. I've done it. All right. Monkey from monkey. That's what happens in his mind. From lizard to monkey. Oh, evolution would have been so much easier if Carl was around. Turn it into a monkey. I'm fed up with a lizard. Just promise me, once again, Carl, I've asked you before. Promise me you'll never have children. Go on. Right. Okay. All right. What you having? Is the tip included? Yeah, go on. That one. Right. In Turkey. Nice. It's not actually. That's where I went. And there was them little fellas after Suzanne in the kitchen. What? What do you mean? We stayed in. We went to Turkey. You went to Turkey and there's some little fellas. Well, they had quite a few sort of midgets working in the kitchen. Why? Is it a theme? Is it a theme holiday? I don't know. Might get them cheaper or something. Was it so they get them cheaper? They were working in the kitchen and one of them fancied Suzanne and kept sort of eyeing her up. And she was winding me up, saying. Oh, not ironing, up and down, just eyeing her up. What was she doing in the kitchen? No, it's like a pick. Pick what you want to eat type, Buffy. But you have people clearing their tables and that ready for you to come along. Are they low tables And. And, you know, he was just keeping an eye on her. What did he say, though? He was Turkish, so I don't know what he was saying, but he was. What do you mean, a little fella? What do you mean, little fella? Sort of dwarf like. Dwarf like he had magic powers or. He was 4 foot. What do you mean, Carl? A little bloke. Just like a normal bloke, but small. If you stood him in the desert, you wouldn't know. Right. Clark, you should watch out for the monkeys underground. You can't just say there was a little fella who was eyeing up my girlfriend and then leave it. What do you mean? What? What was happening? This is a story to us. This is much more interesting to us than. And she was deaf, Right? And she ate red. That's Much more. I don't understand how this. How it manifested itself. Did he come over and say something? No. Do you know, you know when it's like girls know, don't they? When. When some. Someone fancies them. What do you mean? There was lots of them as well. Do they? That's worth knowing. Right, Come on. So you went into this, you went to this holiday. Yeah, yeah. And you went into the, what, the dining room or something? Yeah, downstairs. And you looked at, you thought, this. Is all there's no one's turfing. Yeah. Hold on. You look down and there was a little waiter. There was loads of them running around, busy. Why can they get summer? What do you mean? They had more. They come out in summer. They come out in summer. What do you mean they had more? What do you mean? Because it's busy, isn't it? Why were they all midgets? I don't know. Maybe it doesn't heat stunt your growth or something? No, well, they just happened to. Maybe it was a thing that they did for tourists or something. I don't know. I just got on with my meal. It was a holiday. Do you know what I mean? Go on. Some midget sieving. I'm not gonna ask any questions. Right, okay. Yeah. So they're all little fellas running around and this one always was like, you know, oh, do you. Do you want a new serviette? You know, I mean, going out of. His way, turning on the charm. Yeah, it was going out of his way. The others weren't right. I think what was happening is he'd been working with Santa all winter break. This, this one was your waiter and so he was being polite to you. Maybe, maybe, maybe. But what did Suzanne say then? Well, she was. What, using it to wind me up? What was she saying? Always just like, you know, look, he. May be small, but he's well built. Like a. Yeah, he's all man. So were you jealous of a. Then you were jealous. It is a bit annoying, isn't it? Why? It wouldn't bother me as much now because I've been with her for ages. Right. But at the time that might have been one of our first holidays and it's like you don't want to be pay for this holiday and then you. Get off with a. Yeah. Oh, so anyway. But it doesn't matter because you got chatted by a bearded lady. What? No, that's got nothing to do with that. What were you going to say? What were you going to say? I was going to say the hotel was half Bored and maybe. All right, I thought you're going to say it's just one of her shortcomings. So listen, right, Play a record. Right? Baddie drum boy. Born again. Right, Just get this Educating Ricky out the way. So, Turkey. Yeah. So what is this again? This is Educating Ricky is a tip included. Apparently a fellow was on holiday in Turkey. He's just having a normal holiday. Weather's good, you know, he's having a good time. Wait, is there all normal height? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's having his meal. He is a load of screaming going on in the kitchen. Hold on, is his girlfriend wandered in there? They do with a step ladder. The. The circumcised people in the kitchen and apparently. What are you talking about? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow. We were so. What are you talking about? Well, I'm excited about two things at once here. One, they ^ it in the kitchen. Two, I guessed it was someone losing the end of their knob. I started thinking like Carl Pilkington. Extraordinary. That is amazing. Apparently it was. It was going on. It wasn't just a one off either. Well, when I say a one off, I mean they did it more than once. Yeah, Right. And it was. It was there for a week and apparently the first night it was quiet. And then the rest of the week, every day, it'd be like having his. Having his breakfast or even his lunch or even his tea. Yeah, he'd be doing it all day. Oh, you'd be here in lunch and breakfast. Fair enough. Yeah, don't do that. And apparently it's a tradition over there. You can't even make a complaint about it. It's like. Well, you should have, you know, should have found out before you. You come over. See, I can't believe this is. Sorry. He's in a restaurant in a hotel and there were people having circumcisions in the. In the kitchen. I'm even worried that we're bordering on the racist here. Suggesting that that is petition that Turkish people cut the end of their off in the kitchen. Yeah. At meal times. I think you're wrong, Carl. This sounds ludicrous, Carl. No, I don't think it happens everywhere. Right. I think this is. This hotel. Certain. Certain places. Certain hotels. Certain hotels. What is it? Like two stars? Yeah. Why did he go to the Foreskin Inn? It was his own fault, wasn't it? Sorry, that's it, is it? Have they clue? That's the story. You educated me. Right. Once a fella saw some Turkish people cutting the tip of their Namoff in the kitchen. Thanks very much. Thanks very much, Carl. Got any more? Well, there's things you can learn from it either. Don't go to Turkey. No. Don't have calamari when you're over there. Carl, you've done it again. Well. You too. I love that one. On XFM 104.9, I'm Ricky Germais. Steve Merchant. Carl. Okay, Carl, one more. Can we just don't get the ump. Just because so far you've come up with nothing. What's the last one? Give us the teaser clue. It was. I want to come here in Ironsight. I wouldn't have come here in Hindsight. Yeah, right. Give me some education. This would be the thing that teaches me something. I can feel it in my bones. Come on. There's a kid in Kenya, he was messing about with some beans. Magic. We guessed that as well. You did? Yeah. He sped up because we've guessed his puns. I think they put one of them in his ear. Yeah. The mum or the dad said, oh, what have you done that for? Or whatever. So I'll have to take you to the doctors now. So they took the kid to the doctors and the doctor said, oh, he said, I can get that out. I can sort that out for you. So he took it out, out. And the doctor said, right, that's. That's three pound fifty. And the dad said, I've only got 270 on me. And the doctor said, right, well. And he put the beam back in his. His kids here. I. I don't know what to say. I don't know. I mean, I don't know what to say. I mean. A couple of questions for me very quickly. Are you sure that those were definitely the sums involved with it? Well, the equivalent of whatever, whatever the deal with in. In Kenya. Yeah, it was the equivalent of 352. So you would say. What currency was it, Carl, that you translated into sterling? I don't know. No, no, it was saying in, in the thing. It said the equivalent. Did it say that? Yeah. Sorry. Did it say that? Yeah. Did. Carl, look at me, look at me. Did it say that? Yeah, he said. He said that's. That. That was the. Did it say that? Yeah, yeah, it did. It definitely said that. Definitely. Yeah. So it's just like. I suppose. I don't know. I mean, all these things. The idea is, it's not like a lesson, it's like. I'll tell you this, see what you can get from it. Sure. So you look at what I've told you already. The knights who said, shut your face. That's like. That's. That's amazing. That explains itself. Yeah. Turkey with the circumcisions in a restaurant. Yeah, that'll hold me in good stead. Yeah, don't. Don't go there. Whatever. This one, if you're in can. You don't put beans in your ears or something. Or carry £3 50. Or the equivalent of. It's just the idea that the doctor put it back in his ear. He forced it back in his ear. So is it still there to this day? I mean, is there any update on that? Or did he go back with the 350? I presume he either went and got, like a second opinion, see if he could get it cheaper. Right. For another doctor. Yeah. Or he said, right, I'll come back next week. Yeah, after I've been paid. Or he saw how the doctor did it and thought, well, I'll have a go at that. She'll get home. Yeah, for free. But he never said what it. How it ended. No, no, but I mean, I. I apologize for this week. I mean, I. I haven't got that much out of it. You've not been en. Oh, it was very, very light. Like I said, it was the. The tug of war. There was a fella in Scotland who had a load of tattoos. Okay. Is that it? Is that the end of the story? 98 covered. Right. Just between his toes. He didn't have done. Why not? Because it looks stupid. I don't know. It just said it just had 98 done. What else? Are you gonna drop the feature? Are you worried? I'm thinking about it. Don't drop the feature. To be honest with you, he'd have. Probably written about this already. This has been a classic. I'm concerned because it's my favorite part of the show. I'm wondering, is there something else we could. What could we do to help you out? Because I just. I hate to see it going well. We can't really. And he's moving this week with the old fellow, so that'll take him about four days. I'm worried that you're not. I'm worried you're not looking at the right. Why don't you go to a library? Quick question for you, Carl, who is a possible guest on next week's Pilkington? I mean, what about your removals, man? Right? Listen, if you. If you've had a experience, it could be anything, right? It doesn't have to be. You've seen a Ghost. It can be that you've, you know, you think you're gonna live forever or you can, you know, do. So any mentalist out there, if you, if you're slightly, you know, wrong, if there's something wrong with you, just email Carl, is it carl.pilkington@xfm.co.uk carl.pilkington atxfm.co.uk Would. You like to be interviewed on next week's edition? Yeah. If you are a mental of any description, just lonely, bewildered, stupid, just something wrong with you, right, and you've seen somewhat that's, you know, interesting to you but absolute bollocks, then please call Carl.
