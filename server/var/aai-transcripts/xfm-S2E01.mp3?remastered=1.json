Yeah, it's gonna be a proper DJing. Because I think coming up soon, some great tracks, including a new one from ABS and an old one from Snow Informer. You know, we're gonna be Stormy Ekka Boom Boom down. I'm joking, of course. We've got some fantastic tracks. This is a great chat. And we've got Carl. This will be great chat, Steve. I'm Ricky Gervais on XFM 104.9. There he is indeed. With him, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington, of course. Say hello, Carl. All right? Yeah, nice. And you. You say you read. The beginning of a radio show is very much your wares. Your shop window laying out your stall. I don't think you could choose a better track than the Only ones. Another Girl on the Planet. I'd love to hear it. Another Planet. One of my favorite intros. That amazing. Oh, that was dangerous. Cuz I once heard on Capital Radio, this has got to be the greatest rock intro of all time. And they played Money for Nothing by Dire Straits. Brilliant. Yeah. I can just imagine them putting their head down. I remember a friend of mine when I was at school, he just bought a car and he took me outside to show off the stereo system, Money for Nothing, just to just. He just played that. I've never heard a song before, just played that for its entire four or five minute duration. Yeah, it's a good song for showing off intros and sound systems. Exactly. Yeah. You said you were driving along earlier, you saw someone. Are you? Are you? Yeah, yeah. It was one of those zooped up, sort of sporty saloons, you know, the big boat, like a Mondale or someone as big. And it was blaring out and the bloke and it was sort of like. I could tell he was 24 but already going bald from like, obviously his estate agency jobs. He's made a bit of money and he's got. And the seriousness was ridiculous. I mean, so loud. And it was going through Covent Garden. He was playing Snow Informer. Oh, do people remember Informed by Snow? It was a big tuning moment. I don't know. It's great. Yeah. I always enjoy it. Can I bring that in next week? Can we play Snow next week where. You can play a tiny little bit. Tiny little bit of snow. Yeah. Loved it. Oh, happy song. You were saying that you've turned over a new leaf. Yeah, yeah. Is that in all aspects of your life or is that just in your broadcasting career? Because the reason I bring that up is because. Do you want to describe what you were eating just now when we came in? Because you're a 40. You're 40 year old man, you put on a little bit of weight. So presumably you're watching what you eat. Well, no, but it sounded exotic. I went into a cafe and I didn't. They didn't have a cheese sandwich. Right. And can I describe what it looked like to me? Right. It looked to me like a big slab of cheese. You've just got them to just cut off a big block of cheese, like the size of a CD case or one of those double albums. Right. Of cheese. Right. And just lightly melt that for me so it drips over my hand and it gets really greasy in the back. But just lay some strips of bacon on the top. Yeah, but listen, you've embarrassed yourself. No, it's a croque monsieur. So it's French. It's a what? A croque monsieur. A croque monsieur. Yeah. And so I got. I thought, I've never heard of a croc. Monty. You're embarrassed to say. Is that how it's pronounced? So is it croque monsieur? Oh, you didn't expect me to be bringing out the French. Hey, Tremulous. Music pop. Oui, Je t'em the music pop. Le plume de matante Ouella. Sandy Cad Initiative. That means my aunt's pen. So what was it then? A crop. It was a crop and it was just too greasy. It was just too. And it was all wobbly. Well, I like toast. I like it to be crisp. Sure. It's the thing with like. What? This is rubbish. Play Coldplay. Coldplay. That's all right, isn't it? Yeah, it's not bad. Yeah. Nice little track. Well, Steve, we've been away now for what, 12, 13, 14 weeks, really? Yeah. I've been looking forward to coming back. It's great. It's great to be back. Yep. Yeah. And, yeah, we've had some. Some. Some laughs and tears in the interim, I imagine. Yeah, we've had a few ups and downs, obviously. Me working on the TV show the Office, BAFTA winning, coming soon. I just need to mention something quickly to you. When did I last see you? I saw you yesterday, didn't I? Yeah, because we went up to Edinburgh yesterday. We were. We were very nicely invited to go and talk at the Edinburgh International Television Festival. It Was quite a big deal. We went out there, we were interviewed and Ricky chose to go on the train because it takes like four hours at four and a half hours or something on the train. But it's quite leisurely, it's quite gentlemanly thing to do. Yeah, I opted to go for the plane option and fly up there. More modern. Exactly. And. And they bankrolled that. They paid for it all. And that was all very nice. And as I recall, when I last saw you, we got cab, didn't we? And you asked if you could get the cab to drop you off at the train station. Yeah, and then it took me onto the airport. Ye. Did I Now that was. That was before the last time I saw you was before I got to the airport and missed my flight, wasn't it? Because. Because I had to drop you off in the center of town. Yeah, no, that was. So that was just before I had to pay 165 pounds to upgrade to another ticket. Did you not tell me that in the last hour? £165, Ricky. I had to pay because we dropped you off at the train station. So I mean, do you want to go halves on that or what? Do you want to. How do you want to deal with that? How do you want to sort that whole. That whole mess? Why were you late? Why was I late? Because we dropped you off in the center of Edinburgh and you know how hard it is to get out of Edinburgh and rush hour traffic. But it was only. It was only three minutes away, so you'd have missed it anyway. No, because if we'd gone the other direction, it would be 20 minutes. It took me like an hour to get to the trip to the airport and I got there and the plane had already left and the cabbie was just laughing. He was saying we're never going to make it because you were a religious man, you better start praying. I thought he was being facetious. He was absolutely right. 165 pounds. Hold on. Why didn't he tell you that when he. When, when he picked up a car. It makes you wonder. So obviously I'm a little bit annoyed because, you know, I'm not a man who likes to sort of spend unnecessarily. But wait, but this is not my fault because you were there when we made that decision. I didn't impose this on you. We both decided that might be it. It's both our fault. I mean, it's no one's fault. It's both our fault is. That's fair. That's all I wanted to hear. It's both our fault, therefore it's both our financial obligation. No. 165 pounds. Just split that in half. Write a check, Rick, Write a check. I trust you. Phone in. I think everyone. This is. You're clearly irrespons. No, of course I'm not. If you. If you share a cab and then one person's lucky enough to not be late and one person is unlucky enough and that's what it is, bad luck. I don't think you share the obligation. It's a moral dilemma this, isn't it? But it's more than that though, isn't it? Because let's be honest, even if you had known that I was going to get there late, you'd have wanted me to hang around just so you weren't left around waiting for a train because you get bored sitting there. You'd have wanted me to at least got in that car. I got there way too early. I actually got there about. I was there about 30 minutes. So you made it fine then. That was. Well, exactly. So, I mean, I did. I. I sacrificed me hanging around for half an hour so you could get it a quarter past four. And the other thing is this. You were going to get it a quarter past four anyway. Yeah, but I would. If I'd gone the other direction, not dropped you off in the center, I would have been there in time. Would we? Would we? Is that true? Wow. Only God knows. Well, and the cabbie, what I mentioned it to. So I'll tell you what, to cheer you up, I'll tell you what' better than 80 quid. I'll tell you what's better, shall I? Music. What are you paying the whole 165? Listen, I've brought in a little track here. Bruce Springsteen off the Ton Of Love album. And I know you're a Springsteen fan. We should just qualify this because a lot of people who listen to XFM obviously a bit edgy about Springsteen. They just think he's this old kind of ludicrous 80s rocker. The bandana, you know, the flying the flag, which he never really was. No, that was Bon Jovi. Exactly. But seriously now, do you know, I mean, he did write some great music in the 70s and he just got a little bit kind of pompous in the 80s. But he still turned out some amazing tunes. One of which I imagine is this one, Rick. This one's called Brilliant Disguise. Bit of Springsteen there. Brilliant disguise on XFM 104.9. I think that's. That Soothed you a little bit. That's, that's not really taking the blood off. I just remember something. 80 quid. You know what? We finished the talk about sort of three and we had a couple of hours to kill before we got the. About half two, wasn't it? A couple hours before we got the, the taxi and, and we were eating in this cafe and Steve said, how long's your train? Jenna said, I'll have four and a half hours. He went, so you said, I'll get about 10. He went, half six me. And he's quite smug. And I went, yeah. I said it is quite a long time. I just started to sort of relax. And over he went, yeah. I said, but he said, I think I'm come off better here because usually you've organized all this stuff. He said, but I think you've chosen wrong. I think I said, I think you're right. You think. Those words were coming back to for me as I was handing over 165 notes, all I was thinking was first. Class, drinking John Smith's. Yeah. And listening to Mercedes. But I had it over my initial card. She said, 165 quid. Then I went, fine. I had overcard. It was a switch card. She said, we don't take switch. I was thinking out, what am I going to do then? I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't know where I'm going to get the money from. What did you do in the end? Luckily I had another card all right, and, and she managed to accept that one. But I, I don't know what I'd have done. I don't genuinely. You didn't tell me you had another card. Yeah, I got two cards. Have you? Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, yeah, yeah. I was so depressed because I just kept thinking about what I'd said to you. I've won this time because normally I'm always like legging it for tubes or I'm just, you know, where I get stuck in the rain and I've organized. The driver or something because when you get me, I said, why, it's up to you. It's up to you, you know, I mean, every man for themselves. But this time it was four and a half hours and I was just in that 40 minutes on the, on the plane, there'd be no problem. Yeah. Unbelievable. I'm so livid. Do you know, I got off because I was not very well either. I'm a bit ill at the moment. I got off the plane and I thought, well, I could get a cab from the airport all the way back home, but you know, I've already been stung for 165 quid. Got the tube. Took me forever, really. Not gonna lie to you, it took me forever. So I got it probably later than you did, around the 11 o'clock mark. You didn't really. No, I wasn't quite as bad as that, but I was so I'm really depressed, Rick. So I was saying 50 quid is what we're. I mean Steve does not like to waste money and I mean, by that I mean. I mean I don't have to spend money. No, we actually had to go out and get our shirt for a photo shoot. Not quite an important photo shoot for. I think the times I went out, he was buying a shirt, buying a shirt, went out, planned it, wasn't sure, came back four night in 14.99 from Henny's. Henny. He knew he was aiming. He aimed straight for Henny's. He knew where he can get a bargain. This is a man. But it seems to me that that kind of price you can throw them away at. You don't even need to wash them really. You can throw them away using like Kleenex. Have you ever thrown one away? No, just scrape off the stains and. Keep on wearing time. When we went to the casino for my birthday and I was like under quid down and some people under quid out. Under quid down. He. After the three hours we were there, was down £20. Genuinely depressed. I was almost crying. Yeah, because I don't want. It's because it's a mugs game gambling. It really is. Was that where we. Because I went there. It was when it was one time we went there. It was our agents. Oh, that was another time we were there and he was up and he'd got. He got away and it was 30 quid up and so I said, it's your round then. And the round was more than 30 quid. And he couldn't believe it and he sat, sat down and he went, I couldn't believe it, he said. And I bought him a present. So I was already down. Yeah, I was. I turned out. I was already down because I bought our agent a gift. I didn't see him, Byron. And you know that thing where you're buying a round of drinks for people you don't even know? So it's like, what's the story there? Why am I suddenly bankrolling new drinks? It's like I Don't know you people. I'm not going to get any kind of. I'm not going to see you again to sort of reap the benefits. Because he came in. Most of you are married or engaged, so I'm not even going to pull from it. It was a waste of time. It was like just pure generosity. It was something like from Swingers because he came into the cocktail bar holding three chips up worth £10 each. Hello. Like that. Yeah, I was 30 up. That's a lot of money, you know, Carl, you. You know that 30 quid. You don't want to sniff at that. Oh, what, what. What song should we play? Let's. We put lots of songs in. It's hard. Bit of a. Bit of Incubus. Just a little more depressed. I thought it was a bit slow. I know, but I'm a fan. I like slow songs. But always been a fan of. Even from, you know, early days. I thought his first sound was really great and much maligned. People didn't like it because they were expecting like, you know, the Verve. Yeah, yeah. Urban Hymns and all that. Yeah, yeah, that's. That's great. On XFM 104.9. Who are you? Ricky Gervais. Who are you? Steve Merchant. Is that little round headed fellow Carl Pilkington? Carl, I've had a lot of cars today. He's a bit tired, aren't you? Just a little bit. What happened? You came back from Edinburgh today as well, didn't you? On the plane this morning? Yeah. Got an early, an early flight. Yeah. It's just annoying me because there's. There was like people on the plane fighting over where they wanted to sit. Surely they've got designated seats. Well, they have, but that wasn't good enough for them. They wanted like, they wanted to sit next to the friends and then it's like, well, you can't because you didn't check in together. So that's. That's the way it is. Yeah, done. But the thing is, it's from Edinburgh. 40 minutes. Yeah. And I just don't understand this sort of. You can stand for that long, can't you? Well, why do you have to sit next to the person anyway? To be honest? I mean, fair enough if you're going on a long flight, someone to talk to. But for 40 minutes it really doesn't matter. I never want anyone to talk to. I don't want anyone sitting next to me to talk to me. Why? What are they there for? What? I don't mean people I go with. I mean If I'm traveling alone and I sit next to someone, I don't want to talk to me. Yeah, but I don't really know. If I was traveling with you, I'd really not want you to talk to me. Not if you're gonna talk like this. Yeah. Oh, you sound like you're suicidal, mate. It's just a couple of people arguing. It's over, man. Yeah, Playing dirty space. Why is it still stupid? He paid 160 quid and he's not winning. He doesn't care. 165 quid. Let's get it right. If we're gonna bring it up, we're gonna mention it. And it's like Waterford's back to him. He said. He said to me, rick, it's only money. And money is just something you have in case you don't die tomorrow. He's got a great attitud money, Steve. It's like easy come, easy go. So just take a leaf out of Steve, the I'm not spending that much merchant and you're have a happier life. Sorry, I just need to defend myself for a minute. There are certain instances in life where now you're giving me an attitude like that. I'm tight. It's not tight. Shut up. Let me defend myself. It's not that I'm tight with money, it's that I want to get value for money at all times. Because, you know, you probably got a lot of cash given to you maybe as pocket money when you were as a kid. Every penny I've ever had is be money I've earned. So frankly, I'm going to spend it wisely. Like, for instance, you might say you're in party. So you're at a party, maybe in a bar with someone's birthday, you get talking to a girl, right? Maybe you buy her some drinks, right? You're chatting to her and then you're chatting away for two hours. And then at the end of the evening, she says, oh, I gotta go meet my boyfriend now, right? She's wasted my money and my time there. That's two hours wasted and money wasted, right? Now, she should have told me straight away that she had a boyfriend and I would have bothered with her, right? She was just having a chat with another human being. Rick, where you. I'm being deliberately deceived so people can extract money from me or. Interesting conversation. She knew what I was after, it was obvious, the drooling mouth, you know, the bdis. And. And yet she was leading me on. And she was a prostitute and think how he felt about that. I mean, what a stuff in the face. Try and cheapen it with that kind of cheap sexual innuendo. Right. She. She could occasionally slept with it for a few. It was for meals. Yeah, but the point was, do you know what I mean? It's just that sort of attitude generally in my life. He's like, don't waste my time, you know, don't waste my time or my money. Life is. The clock is ticking as far as I'm concerned. And, you know, and so just. If you've got a boyfriend and I come up and I'm chatting you up, just let me know and I'll wear a bag. I won't bother you. Glad you mentioned that, because I feel we should. They should definitely introduce some kind of bad. You see, the problem is that women without boyfriends will be wearing those badges now and you won't be able to, you know, I mean, you won't be able to say, have you really got a boyfriend? No, I just think there should be some kind of sort of. This sort of. There should be an etiquette. There should be an understanding. Yeah. You know, because they know, like, they can see what I'm after. Is it obvious? Is it? I make it very clear. You're not a subtle man. No, I just come over and pant. Do you still. Do you still try and attract their attention by throwing small rocks at them? Yeah. Does that. Has that ever worked? Occasionally. Is it really, you know, the desperate ones or homeless ones? Oh, the homeless. Once he once, right, he said to me, he came in to work and he said, I gave a homeless girl a pound, right, because I fancied her. He said, is that wrong? Is that really bad? I don't think it is. You see, I don't think it is, because it seems to me, if she was an attractive homeless girl and she deserves some of my money slowing down. I might seem like going past loads of tramps going, get out, babe, get a job. And she goes, ah, hello. But I have to say I did for a moment just pause and think to myself whether I could kind of scoop her up in my arms, take her back to my place and kind of turn her life around. Like My Fair lady, kind of teach you to speak properly and dress her up in smart clothes and take her out into sort of society. I think that's where your first mistake was. You said, listen, love, I'm up for it if I can hose you down. That was where you went wrong. Smith's Cemetery gates. Great one it always cracking off. Queen is Dead. Voted best album of all time, I think, in the Enemy poll. I don't think it is there, but strange. Here we go. I agree, I agree. Yeah, yeah, cracking. Anyway, Carl. Yeah. So people are arguing on the flight. How did you enjoy Edinburgh, by the way, anyway? Because I saw you up there briefly with you and Nick Frost, your new mates. Nick Frost and Simon Pegg. You know, he prefers them to us now. I know. Apparently I could tell that from just talking to him. It was just. It was the way he was sort of looking at them over there. He was just smiling at Nick Foss. He's his new best chum. You love Nick Foster. Would you have preferred it, right, if I went to Edinburgh and had to sit with some people that I really didn't like? Would you have been happier for me? No. Do you know, But I had a. Great time with Simon and Nick and they. And they'd nice be. Kept going. He kept going. He kept going to her. Oi, oi, Nick, tell Ricky that story. And Nick and Summer, well, all it was, right? And they're ghost stories. That's. He loves them. Because they believe in ghosts. Oh, it's not just. They're great sense of humor. Just because they believe in ghosts. You go and tell them that. He goes, how'd you explain that? I was going, well, I wasn't there. Yeah. What was that one you told me? And it was completely wrong about the. It was. Oh, yeah, right. It's years ago. Oh, yeah. Some. In olden days. Yeah. Some doctor or something who was into, like, the way bodies work. They got their head cut off. The doctor, yeah, he was doing a bit of an experiment and he cut. His own head off. Yeah. Okay. And it was about. So when my head's in the basket, I'm gonna blink my eyes. Right, okay, sorry, hang on, let him finish. And so the doctor has chopped his own head off. And he's told everyone, I'm gonna blink my eyes. It's in the basket. And he goes, like, right, I'm gonna blink my eyes about, you know, as many times as I can to quit. Count them. And. And they count. And he got to like 15 before he. Right, now, this is how Carl told me that until Nick Frost explained that. Carl told you guys. He said, right, well, a bloke, right, he had his head cut off. And as. And when his head was in the basket, he went, count how many times I can blink. And I went, well, that's probably. No. And Nick went, well, no, he actually said when my head's in the basket. And Carl went. Oh, I said. Said Carl. Do you know the subtle difference? Do you see the subtle difference? I have to say, though, guys, I still don't really understand what went on there. I really. You both lost me. The story is that a bloke who'd been found doing. You mean that? Carl just explained it, and that was a clear. Because I still don't know what you're talking about, Carl. Well, this bloke had his head cut off for experiments against God. He was a doctor in the. You know, in olden times. And when they cut his head off. Why did they cut his head off? Because it was crimes against. Exactly. He's executed. Yeah. And he said to his assistant, when my head's in the basket, I'm gonna blink. Count how many times I blink and write it down as an experiment, right? Carl told it to me like his head was cut off and he went in the basket. And when his head was in the basket, he looked up and said, count how many times I blink. Yeah, I love that. I love the difference in that story. Yeah. Both rubbish. But, you know, one's. One's possible and one is anything you. Believe, anything that you're told, except when we tell you the truth. Right, here's one. Ghosts and that we got talking about. And Nick. Nick said, right. He said, you'll like this one. He said, my. My auntie was having loads of problems. Why are you whispering? It's not illegal to talk about ghosts on the radio. No, but. So the aunt is in the house and that, and furniture's moving about all the time. Oh, God. And they were like, oh, Steve, you. Told me this one. This is such rubbish, mate. Now, come on, let's listen. I'm gonna sit back and enjoy it. I'm just gonna watch your face, Steve. All right, Sorry. So I missed the beginning there, Carl. There's an antenna. Basically, Nick's anti. Right in the house, things moving around all the time. It was just annoying. Every time she tidied up, it was like, it's just annoying making a mess. It was one part annoying to two parts scary. Yeah. Y. So stuff was. Stuff was moving around all the time. And they said, right, rather than we need the housekeeper, rather than having the house a mess until we saw. Stop. I've got the vicar coming round. Stop around. Oh, yeah, go on. They said that shouldn't be in the pants draw. Let's put all the furniture in one room, right? So just have one room that's a mess. And have all the others empty because. I love the poltergeist. Can't really. It can move wardrobes around but it can't open the door to put it in another room. Yeah. Park was going, oh, I'm just making this room messy. I wish someone opened the door so I could go on. Yeah, but so. So all this stuff's in this room. So they moved all their furniture into one room. Put like the drawers in there and everything. And it was really uncomfortable because they were all like on top of each other. They sat in the room with all the stuff. Yeah, they had to. Cuz that's where the three piece suite was. Okay. Oh God. Oh God. So they sat there all crumpled up on that. But nothing can move because it's so tight. Tight things. I think things were trying to move. Yeah, everything was so tight. They foxed that photo guys. So. So anyway, one night they sat there like sort of bit awkward watching the telly and that. And yes, I'm banging. Yeah. In the next room. So she goes, oh God, what's that? Oh, he hadn't moved in. I knew the ghost. So to some of the empty rooms. So does this move some friends and family in? There's this banging about going on. She gets up, up, right? Yeah. And what it is, they had the baby in the next room because there wasn't much room for the cop. Right. So they left the baby with the ghost. So they go into the room where the baby is and the banging. Yeah. Is like. Do you know those plastic balls you get that you can chuck around the room and like they go mental, right? The ones that you chuck once and they keep bouncing for ages that was bouncing around the room. The baby had thrown it in all the walls and the baby was there, there stood in the cot sort of laughing, right. And looking at the ball. And wherever it looked, the ball went. Yeah. And then she said, she said, stop doing that. Yeah. And the ball just stopped. Did it and it rolled a bit. Right. So the baby had thrown the ball and it was watching it as it bounced around the room. It wasn't throwing it, it was in control of it. No, the point is, Steve, the baby has been doing. It would have been the baby all along. The baby had been messing with the furniture. It was her superpower. Yeah, it's the baby that had the power. Special baby. It's the baby that had the power. It's the baby that had the power. What? The power of telekinesis. They were then trying to convince me that telekinesis was not like all the other stuff that I didn't believe in. But that was a science. Right? Telekinesis was possible. Yes. Yeah. It's not. It's not like. It's not like ghosts and demons and all that stuff. Telekinesis is different. Yeah. That's science. But Nick's auntie saw it and I. Love the fact that you're telling me that someone else's auntie saw it. So I should be. I should be satisfied with that. Yeah, I should be satisfied with that. I mean. So does she still live in one room with all her possessions? No, I think he grew out of it. Apparently the baby grew out of it. So it doesn't use his telekinesis powers? Well, no, he's making carry in it. She. She was upset for a bit and then she got over it. Okay, I'm just gonna say one thing, Carl, that was a film. Do you want to play record or get free? Right. On XFM 104.9. Can I just tell you a story that Carl told me a couple of weeks ago? Is this another ghost story? Yeah. I called him out, what are you doing? He said, oh. I said, I've just been reading ghost stories again. He went. He said, right. He said, you don't believe in him, but how do you explain this? Right? I went, go on. He said, I'll tell you. As he told me it. He went, bloke, right, just sitting at home, just sitting at home doing, you know, watching telly with. With his cat. And the phone rings and it's a bloke going, oh, is that fire in your oven okay now? Because your wife called and you went. Carl went, well, one, there was no fire in the oven. Two, he wasn't married. I went, right, go on. He went, well, then, right? There was a knock at the door and there was two sort of people in sort of white coats. And they kind of said, oh, we've come about that fire. Your wife called us. He went, one, there isn't a fire in Ireland. And two, I'm not even married. All right? He said, they saw the cat and they sort of. They looked at the cat. It looks a bit weird, the cat. The cat coming out. And he said. And then he went back and sat down. Phone rings and they said, oh, did they sort out the fire in the oven that your wife told us about? Oh. He went, one, there is no fire in my oven. Two, haven't got a wife. And Carl went, what do you think of that? I went, that's not it. He went, yeah. I went, that's the end of the story. What? What, What? He went, well, how'd you explain that? I went, explain what? I thought he was gonna say. A year later he got married, but she died in an oven fire. Right. I thought it was gonna be that. Anyway, that's what. People winding him up. Yeah. Or, or someone did report a fire oven and their name was Johnson and they looked up Johnson, they got the wrong thing, it was a gas boiler and they sent around to the wrong person, right. You know, he went, yeah, I said, I explained to him. He went, yeah. Why do they look at the cat funny? Oh, man alive. Carl, this is really weird, right? I was, I was in my house once, right, and the doorbell rang. Yeah, right. I opened the door, there was no one there. Yeah, right. And then I looked across the street, kids running away. Yeah. Now how do you explain that? Yeah, there was another time, right, where like I opened the door, there was like, goes, you've ordered pizza. I went, I haven't ordered pizza. And I heard my mate upstairs giggling and putting the phone down. Yeah. How do you explain saying that? Carl, seriously, what did you, why did you tell me that story? What did you think? What do you think it was weird about that? The fact that it was three different people. Is this all the information? Is that the entire story of you three different people? Did you fall asleep and not read the end? A fire that didn't happen about a wife that didn't exist and a cat that didn't look happy. Oh, I'm gonna have a heart attack, girl. What? I mean, why, why did they look at the cat funny? Because cats don't, don't like spirits, do they? What other blokes were ghosts? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it. So these, these are kind of beetle about type ghosts. These are ghosts who walk the. Walk the earth as the undead. Just winding people up slightly. That's lovely. That is lovely. That did not look half. But seriously, why would ghosts wander around just like winding people up? Oh, maybe something did happen there years ago, some fire, some woman might have died in the house of a fire or something. Yeah. And it sort of all happened again. Yeah, it's certainly a mystery. It's a mystery. I mean, I can't. What's this book you were reading? You're reading a book which is interesting enough. It was, it was the fatigue and 14 times. Oh, Carl. Yeah, well, I, I don't know what to say. Well, I'll tell you, this car, there is a track that will that will spook you right out. This is Warren's Evon from. Was it like about 1979, early 80s? Great track. Werewolves of London. Play this Car But don't be scared from 1978. Carl, werewolves of London by Warren Zon. Are you a fan of that? Great track, is it fans of Warren Zon? Maybe if you know he's got a new album mate, as you speak. Although if you're a fan, you probably know that already. Yeah, if you are, people who hate him would be interested in knowing that he's got a new album out. Do you believe in, I think, lycanthropy? Is it. Is it not called. What's that, sorry? Lycanthropy? What's like anthropy? Isn't that werewolfism? Isn't it? Isn't it? Do you believe in that, Carl? They've. They've found stuff, haven't they? They found kids walking about who are all airy because they've sort of grew up with wolves and that. Yeah, yeah. You see two things there, right? You cannot take on acquired characteristics genetically. So if you grew up with wolves, it wouldn't suddenly make you hairy. There's been pictures. There's been pictures. There's been stories on it. And I reckon most people have, or a lot of people have seen the stories. It's a popular thing. You mean the kids that are born hairy? No, there's kids who have been born airy. Right, yeah, that's it. No, but listen. And they walk around on all fours and they drink milk from a saucer. Oh. Oh, Steve, this is. No, remember, listen. Remember that time with the maggot and the head and getting out with bacon and you were, like, laughing and then people called up and said, yeah, I've seen that. I've read about that. Yeah, this is the same thing. Have you seen an XFM listener up close? Have you ever looked? They drink milk from a softer. Yeah, they've got to be kept on leading people who listen to this show. There's no point in me telling you about stuff. There is, it's comedy. When you were out of school, did you keep arguing with the teacher, saying, you're talking rubbish there. Teachers didn't teach us about werewolf boys and ghosts. They taught us maths. God. Right, tell the story about the man I'll cover. Right. In the same magazine as the one with the. With the cat and the fire and that. Don't tell me that story again. It gives me the shit. Yeah, a cat that's got a weird Expression on his face is against God. Anyway, this isn't a scary story. This was just like physics. Physics. It was going on about the nuclear bomb and how powerful it is and they put a manhole cover on top of one. Blew it up. Yeah. Never saw the manhole cover again. Man alive, Carl, what's going on there? Something weird is happening there. If anyone has ever seen that man on cover. Yeah. Please get in touch. We'd love to know where it is. Oh, that's fantastic. What sort of experiment is that? I imagine all these scientists on multi billion pound research budgets, they're going, we test everything. What would you do with mano cover? Don't know. That's like letting a couple of students. Exactly. Do you reckon it can send a traffic cone into orbit? Go on then, put it on there. I love that. I imagine that. What of what value is that we could do? We could let the put the manual cover on it and aim it and then blow the bomb up and it would, it would. The manual cover would have someone's ey. Fire it. See if you can fire manhole covers off the nuclear bomb. Tie bangers to a bomb. See if it's louder. Oh God. Okay, listen Carl, play on the track and then afterwards can we probe your views on the week's news? If you want, we'll do a bit. Of a white van, Carl. Same session. Smashing Pumpkins Today. Today. Today is the greatest. Cuz we're back. That's true. All right. I hope people were listening to that loud in this lovely summer's day. Oh, I mean not too loud. Don't annoy people. Yeah, white van. Yeah, white van, Carl. I mean for those that don't know, we do this, we ask Carl the question. Questions that the sun asked someone else. That's right, the sun every day asks some, you know, average Joe his views on the week's big stories. Carl, let me ask you now, what do you make of Prince Harry smoking openly at a polo club? Are you aware of this story? No. Was it gone? Prince Harry, you know that he's one of the royals. Yeah. And he was seen smoking openly. Openly a. A cigarette third in line to the throne? Something like that, yeah. Imagine that someone's smoking a cigarette. Is 39 to the throne a secret, Carl? Is it a non smoking polo club? You know, I don't know. But, but if it were, would that make things even worse for you? Seriously, what do you make of it? This is, this is, you know, the whole, you know, the Ferrari is. He's a role model you know, he's a royal. Should he be seen puffing away in a public place? I don't think it matters. Does it not concern for you? How old is he? Is he old enough to smoke? I think he probably is, yeah. I think the trouble with this role model thing, with anything that's legal, it should either be illegal or not. Yeah. I just don't think you can impose things because you could say that it is bad for you and it is bad to start smoking and it really is bad for. You know, it causes cancer and everything. Everyone knows that, don't they? Well, yeah, but you should either make it illegal or shut up about it. So this is Carl you're asking, isn't it? I am indeed. So we can throw these questions your way as well if you don't. Yeah, but it doesn't matter. But, Carl, what your views generally. I mean, it's obviously cigarettes are perfectly legal and so on, but what about stronger narcotics? Because I know you're very scared of drugs and stuff, aren't you? I'm not a fan, no. What's your concern? What's your worry? Just like you might get into them, just like you might have them and go, oh, this is all right. Exactly. Exactly. Although I was talking to you about it earlier and you weren't that you weren't very sympathetic about a lot of young people who. Who have perhaps gone to crack or smack you. You didn't you describe it as their own fault? Sometimes it isn't it. Yeah. I mean, I could have turned to it where I grew up, but I said, well, don't want to do that. It's not good for you. So I avoided it. You turned to ghosts. So you've got no sympathy for anyone who's a drug addict. It's her own fault. It depends, doesn't it? Sure. Do you know what I mean? You can be an addict if I don't know something. I'm trying to think of a nice. Way that most people start on stuff like that because something really traumatic's happened to them. Very few people go out for a laugh. Yeah. One night and. And go, let's all try it. So, you know. But yeah, just say no, I suppose is the. Listen to the cast of Grange Hill. Now, this will scare you now, this car. You will be a little bit unnerved about this. Have you seen the film Jurassic Park? Yeah. You know what happened there? Well, according to the sun here, it says scientists are planning to clone mammoths for a theme park. Look at his face. Look at that. He looks like a dog caught in the headlights of a car. He's terrified. He sprung to attention. Is that the best news you could have? Man moths. Right? Yeah, man moths. The fact that. That's why he was so excited that they bred a man moth. What. What is this? Yeah, it's. It's a human being that. That hides in your wardrobe and eats the entire jacket in a day. Yeah. What do you mean, man moths? Man moth. Mammoths. Mammoth. The big hairy cow from the Ice Age. I mean, elephant. You're not so excited about that. Then. You could take or leave bringing back mammoths to life, but a man moth. A man moth is a different matter. If we. If we'd have never brought that up, he'd have gone and told someone now, yeah, you know, I've bred an half man, half moth. And that's how things start. This is what we mean. When you do these ghosts, are you slightly deaf? Is that it? When you hear these stories is you're slightly deaf? And his head. And his head was in the basket and he went, count how many times I blink. Is it? I. Is. Is English your first language? Are you actually foreign? Is that. Yeah, yeah. We mean, not of this planet. Yeah. Should we speak slower? Would that be of help to you? No, go on. What do you make of her? Prehistoric animals. He's John. Giant elephants. They're slow, aren't they? It's not as if they're gonna, like, get out and run fast and they can't capture them. They'd probably be a fence. But they're. But you're asking it as if, like, oh, it could all go wrong. But it couldn't, could it? Well, but. But the point was about Jurassic park is they thought it wouldn't go wrong. They thought they had it all under control. That thing from Jurassic Park, Carl. Dinosaurs would say, oh, think about it before you do it, but with a. With a airy elephant, it's. It's not gonna not contain you. Would you go along to see him? Would you be interested in that? If it was in the area. He's great, isn't he? I'd love. I'd love a queue. No, but what I'd like to do is Carl sitting like Yoda in a little cave. And I just like to see people like Tony Blair and, you know, Stephen Hawkins in a queue and they go and say, carl, got a bit of a problem. You're thinking of cloning a man and a moth problem not an issue. No, If I'm in the area, I want cruise around and have a look at it. Otherwise, just don't send it near my clothes. Oh, that's fantastic. So just for a second, as the words man, moth came into your head, how excited were you? I mean, were you both terrified and excited for. Just for the moment when you thought that they cloned a man and a moth? I pictured. What kind of face did he have? Did he have the moth's head or was it a man's head? Just a little head. Little man head. Right. What. What was his face? What did it look like? Just. He just was like a bit, like perplexed. Yeah, like so it was like he'd been. He'd been. He'd been grafted onto the body of moth when he was asleep. Yeah, he'd woken up. He just. He just went in for to have a goiter removed and they said, we've replaced your goiter with the body of a giant moth. Yeah, just that. All right, Mr. Jenkins. So he had the head of a little. Was it a little boy or a man? Little man. Right, okay. And he's just bumping into a lamp. If you went into hospital and they'd done something, what's the worst thing I could do? Right. What would you rather have done? Do you. Right. You wake up and you've got lobster claws for hands. You wake up and you've got ducks feet. Or you wake up and you've got one horn coming out of your head. The worst thing. Yeah, probably the. The horn coming out of my head. Why get in the way? That'd be useful, wouldn't it? In fights and stuff and for like, parties. Well, I suppose the lobster claws would also be quite handy, though. Definite. Black level Motorcycle club. Spread your love. You enjoying it so far? Yeah, I suppose so. First show back? Yeah, it's not bad. It's great to be. I'm just thinking about that money, Rick, to be honest. I know, I know, yeah. Could we maybe get like a sort of telethon type thing going or a little charity thing, just sort of help me pay? You can't really ask people to send you money. It's technically begging. Is it? Yeah. Okay. Are you a registered charity? I suppose not. Not really. We could probably get your status. Yeah, but could I promise? I mean, could I pretend to give them something in return? I mean, am I allowed to sell things on the radio? Yeah, you are. Yeah. Although you probably. You probably get in trouble with the authority if you're using it to sort of like to your own, like everyone else. Doesn't look exactly free Lunches and sponsorship and God knows what. You know what I mean? Yeah. Put the people that work here small fry. The scum. Exactly. The newbodies. Yeah. Yeah. But 165 quid is pretty. It's quite a lot of money. So. I mean, if you want to contribute anything, Rick, as I said before, you're more than welcome to. Yeah, no, I. I would if I felt any responsibility. Right. Yeah. Or cared. But, yeah, I got there too early, which is annoying. What we should have done, really, was get you your plane and come back because I'd have had time. You know, I was going to mention it at the time, but I didn't want to because I knew the answer would be no. Oh, Carl. Oh, I really. I've had a great time. I've forgotten. I've forgotten how good it was just to have a normal con. I say normal just to have a conversation with you. You. We've been looking forward to this. He's really down today, isn't he? It's interesting because I said to him, I said to him, did you enjoy Edinburgh? He spent the week up in Edinburgh, obviously. And he said, yeah, well, after me. Loved it up there. He's been partying every night and he actually enjoyed it. And I've never. I've never met him when he's actually enjoyed anything before. He's never enjoyed anything as far as I know. And we weren't involved. It's paper. He loved the paper round and this is the first time. He was talking about that the other day as well. But I said that's when he really thinks that that paper only had when he was 14, was the best job he'd ever had. He still thinks the best job because he was home. He said he was his own boss with. No, you weren't. He went, well, I'll get on my bike and think. And he said, I bet if I phoned those people who I delivered the papers to, they'd say it was the best delivery they've ever heard. He said, in fact, I bet a lot of them have chucked in delivery because it went downhill. This is all he's thinking this. He went along. Yeah. Didn't you? Yeah. Imagine phoning someone upstairs. You don't know me, but I used to live your paper 10 years ago. Was it the best delivery service you ever had? No. But if I said I delivered it 10 years ago, you used to. If you got up at like, six in the morning, it was there for you. Yeah. There's no other paper boy who could guarantee that they'd have that paper when they got. If you could earn enough money, Would you do a paper round again if that was your job but you were being paid enough to make a living from it? Is that something you think about? Do you think you'd enjoy it as much nowadays? Yeah, I reckon I would, yeah. Be honest and listen to some music. Sure. A thousand pound a week. Would you do the best? Yeah. Would you really? Yeah. Is there anyone out there who is willing to test that? So anyone who's willing to pay Carl? Right. Some of them are grand. Yeah. To take a week off work and deliver papers just for that week. All day, though. It's all day. No, no, no, no. I'll get up and the. The customers will have their paper. Yeah. But can I tell you what street it? No, because. No, no, it's the M25. See, you are being paid a thousand pounds. The M25. I'll tell you what, let's. Let's. Let's take the mood down a little bit and play one of the most beautiful songs I've been looking forward to getting, by the way, just to play this, to be honest. It's Jimmy Web's version of Galveston. Galveston there by the brilliant Jimmy Web. Who wrote it? Who wrote it? He wrote it, Yes. I mean, yeah, yeah. Who wrote it? It was all one sentence. Yes. Did I confuse you again? Yeah. With my speech pattern. It's just. Just using the English language is always. Helpful, but compared to Carl, I'm. I'm Oscar Wilde. I suppose so. Electric soft Trade on XFM 104.9. Not long to go on our. On our triumphant return. I think. I think the places to be saying Steve. Yes. Yes, Carl. I met Carl a couple times in our sabbatical and he said to me once, he said, oysters. So I said, have you ever tried oysters? I don't like them. And I went. I said, oh, just think about swallowing them whole, you know. Well, the reason you have to do that is to stay. They're. They're fatally poisonous and if you bite into them, they kill you. And I went, well, of course they don't. He went, yeah. I went, well, of course they wouldn't. What if you chewed on that? He said, no. I said, well, so you swallow them hard. They're not poisonous. He went, yeah. Ah, see? He said. So he said, when you swallow heroin in a. In a johnny, he says, that doesn't kill you, does it? That was it. Oh, and then about a week later. And I was wrong about them. Yeah. I went where. I said, yeah, yeah, yeah. And what did you say? It's if you eat them and then you have some whiskey. They. They turn deadly. When. When whiskey comes into contact with them. Yeah. When. When they've had a drink, they get. A bit rowdy in your stomach, they start fighting. They can cause hilarious rupture. So what are you saying now? You're saying you don't believe that? Am I saying what are you saying you don't believe? He thinks he's got us here. He thinks he's got us here. Yeah. I don't believe that. If you eat an oyster, then drink some whiskey, you die. You might not die straight away, but you won't eventually. 50 years time, if you've got. You've got to keep on drinking whiskey. Yeah. 50 or 60 years later, he was dead. Yeah. Oyster and a bottle of escape. Oh. Then out of nowhere, 40 years. Where does this information come from? If some doctor called up now. Yeah. And put you right, would you believe. Him if it wasn't Dr. Fox? Yeah. What about the airy, airy lads growing up with the werewolves and that? They didn't grow up. Werewolves grow up with werewolves. About three different genetic mutation. Where this, you know, they were born with very, very hsu. There were a couple of kids. Yes. We grew up with wolves. And you can't kill them with a silver bullet. I mean, you're confusing two things. There were some kids who were very, very hairy. Yes. Yeah. They're in folklore. There were some kids who grew up with wolves. Yes. I don't think the two were connected. Yeah. There's no such thing as werewolves, Carl. You, you believe me? I saw a documentary on it on the History Channel. You'd have loved it. You, you, you grew up with the mad world, you know, you don't flap around, do and steal people's jewelry. What was the thing you told me about? Snails. Have you ever had any, any post that. That looks like it's been opened? Occasionally, yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, what it is, it's not your postman having a sneaky look. A sneaky look. Problem is, right, Slugs the problem. Slugs. Slugs. At night, they like nipping about and that, and it gets a bit cold. And in London, like in the country, they go into the grass, don't they? Right? But in London, it's like, oh, what can we do? And they go in letterboxes, slugs going letters, getting boxes. It's nice and warm in there, dry and what have you. And these are homeless slugs, are they ones that lost their shell when they're. In there, they only found out that they love glue. They've been eating. Eating the glue off the stamps. Right. And people have been getting charged for post because it hasn't had stamps on it. It's like. Well, I put a stamp on it. It's like slugs have been eating it. Sure. And they also eat the glue that's on the actual envelope. Sh. Shutter. It's a real popular problem this, that letters are being lost and opened and all that stuff. Slugs. Slugs. Like stealing postal orders and things and cashing them in and stuff. Yeah. Again, you know, if there's a doctor, if there's a postman. Yes. Well, with us, two expert witnesses, a doctor and a postman. So. So postage is a real problem. So when we see a slug bug's trail or a snail's trail, it's glue. That's glue they've stolen, is it? That's. They've just. That's a little. I'm not. I'm not gonna say yes. I'm not sure. But we could follow that trail and find them and they'd have a big. Yeah, stamps and. Yeah, there they are. Like birthday cards. Yeah, but two pound notes. Yeah. Oh, that's fantastic. Slugs, oysters and whiskey. Kill you and slap. Be very careful if you're going to go out this evening. You're thinking of having a whiskey, maybe some oysters. Be very, very careful if you are. Going to post a letter. Please, please not use tasty glue. Flaming Lips. That's the penultimate track this week, Rick, isn't it? We got you off now. I'm sure there'll be more high jinks and great conversation next week. I can't wait. In an effort to persuade people that Bruce Springsteen really isn't the laughable rocker a lot of people think he is. We played one at the beginning of the show. It was cracking. This is what I'd like to leave you with. A song for the ladies, Darkness on the Edge of Town from the amazing album of the same name, Springsteen. See you next week. Bye.",
