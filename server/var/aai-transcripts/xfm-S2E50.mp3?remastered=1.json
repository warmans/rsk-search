He's sort of a bit sweaty and fed up today, aren't you? Because of the heat. Too much though, isn't it? He's taken out. He wanted to fight, you know, he doesn't use like a fight. I sort of like lead on him and try and rub his head. Yeah, but today he was sort of leading it. He was sort of like getting a little bit. If I didn't know better, I said it was sexual frustration. I was watching, Rick, if you don't want me saying I was watching, not in that way, just watching. Oh, I want to hit you. And I was thinking, does he want to hit me or does he want to do something else to me? Exactly what were your thoughts, Carl? Exactly. I mean, I saw him sort of wrestling with you on the floor and you clearly weren't enjoying it, but he was. Really? Yeah. What was that going on? What's the change? Why are you suddenly sort of. What are you trying to say? No, I'm not. I'm just saying it was weird that you suddenly. It was like you were all you. Saying that a bit, sort of. A bit gay? No. Is that what you're saying? No, but what was. Suzanne accused me of that in a week. Why? For being a bit gay. So I'm sure you're gay. Why? Just because I was moaning about stuff. She said. Oh, you're a drama queen. Right. What were you moaning about? Not having enough gay sex. No. That she didn't have a knob. Yeah. It's going, oh, why don't you get yourself a nice little knob? Yeah. I mean, can I call you Frank? Could you wear this false beard? Yeah. It's just. Well, we'll talk about later. It was about the Seven Wonders. I just wasn't that impressed. He said, he said. Well, we say that. Yeah. Well, we got a top show coming. Up, but if you are a little bit, kind of just a little bit sexually, you know, don't be afraid to, to let it out. I mean, if you want us to relieve you of it. I'll tell you what, let's have a little bit of Maggie May by Rod. Some beautiful play. Killing a Georgie. That's your favorite song, is it? Oh, that's weird, isn't it? Strange, is it? That's weird. I, I, I like to hear Rod Stewart singing about a lovely lady. Please, Carl. As would I. You can picture whatever you want. Maggie May on XFM 104.9. I'm looking to Vase with me Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkinson. Steve? Well, I. I've only just read about this and I'm quite. I don't know anything about it. This naked rambler, Steve Goff. Yeah. Is he doing some kind of. He's doing a walk from Land's end to John O' Groats. Is he? Completely nude? Yeah. He's been arrested 10 times on the way, apparently. Right. It says here that Nora Gough, his mum, she's in her 70s, she's begged her son not to walk naked from Lansd. Enter John Negroes. She said, I don't know where he gets this from, Certainly not me. I am. And I've always been quite conservative. He would never have been allowed to walk around the house without covering himself up. I wouldn't go as far as to say I'm ashamed of him, but I do not approve of what he is doing. Having said that, it's good to see him on the telly. Yeah. Yeah. It's all about anything embarrassing to. They're famous. However embarrassing it is. But I can't believe my son's a serial killer. Not nice to see him on the telly. It's. It. Well, it's. It looks like one. It's not, obviously, you know, I mean. What is he doing? I don't understand. I wouldn't say he was. And he's not. He's just a rambler. Just. But he's there. Right. What's his motivation? He's just walking to. I don't know, just. It's just a nudist, I suppose. Right. And there's a picture in there and Carl looked at and he went, oh, what's the point of that? He went, well, look at him. He's got shoes and socks on, he's got a rucksack on, he's got a hat on, he's not nude, he's just got his knob out. But he's got a full beard, thinking, I want to hide some skin. Whereas this little chap needs the air. I pop him out all the time, I can. They really annoy me because he's in. In the supplement today as well, with the. With the mirror. Right. And they've done. Done a bit about nudists and that. Yeah. Again, same problems all the time. Come on. There's like an old fella sat there. Just how do you know he's old? Well. Why are you looking? Carl? Yeah, Looking at his face. I knew. Presumably. Yeah. I'm just. I'm just saying he's old and he sat there. SM pipe. Sure. With his sandals on. They're quite normal. Just with his. His knob out. But look, we always make the same mistake. He's got a little white deck chair. Yeah, yeah. If you nudist, don't go. Don't go for white. Why? He's sitting on that, getting a bit clammy and stuff. White. Don't go for white. Go for darker colors. I don't know what he's talking about. I love it. I love the fact that he's just got loads of pictures of naked men. Yeah. Dirty ass on that. I think we've discussed the news before. I don't understand the impulse at all. I don't. I do find it bizarre. I mean, there's a picture there of three men nude in a pub. Yeah. Just having a chat. Yeah. Oh, look at Carl carrying. I mean, okay, fair enough. Walking around outside, but indoors, in a pub, nude. Well, it must be a. Newest. That must be a nudist holiday, I assume, as opposed to, like the local. There is though, isn't it? There was a thing in Bizarre magazine the other week where there was a picture of some people. They've got an airline of their own now. What? Nudists, nudes. Nude airline. So you just. You can get on there. Your holiday starts as soon as you get on. Sure. And. But what's the point? Well, I'd be for it just about banging against things, you know, so to speak. Yeah. My shoes and things. Or spilling the hot when the waitress comes along. She spilled hot coffee. Yeah, that's a good point. Would she have to be nude? But do the stewardesses have to be nude? I don't know. But that bit as well where they walk down the aisle and they have to check if you've buckled up. Yeah. She's like, excuse me, miss, can you just. And over 50s. Always over 50s. Right. Yeah. So it'd be an old woman on the plane. Yeah. Can you just lift your left tit up so I can see the belt? Yeah. Oh, God. Oh. Imagine if you've got to go into the crash position. Oh, God. Yeah. The last thing you see is your John Thomas as you go crashing into a mountain. And then what if you've got an abandoned ship? I know. Well, how would they explain that? Yeah. Onto an island. Exactly. All right. Or being picked up by, you know, a passing ship. Yeah. Carl, you notice they also play volleyball a lot, don't they? Yeah. I mean, you've always mentioned that, but I thought you were joking. But they love it. Yeah, they've said. They said that's what they do. They get to this special holiday that. Can only be either they got the idea from sort of like Carry On Camping or Benny Hill, or they actually like it. Jiggling around as much as possible. Yeah. But is that safe? Well, I assume so. You play volleyball with trousers on, don't you? I wouldn't have thought there's a better, like, support there. I mean, I was watching athletics. Right. The other week. Yeah. Right. And I was watching it because there's a lad who I went to school with, these, like, winning gold medals and everything now and stuff. Right. So I was looking out for him. Now, if you went to school with him, I'm assuming he's got three legs or something. No, no, he's not just a regular guy. He used to push me on my go kart. So I feel like I've. You've trained. I was there from the start. Training up a bit. Yeah. And watching the program and it was swimming in it and was watching that for a bit. Getting a bit annoyed. Because that butterfly stroke. Yeah. I don't. I don't know why they do that. No, nor do I. It's just hard work. It doesn't make you go any faster than, say, the. That. That stroke. Yeah. Don't do that. That stroke on radio doesn't work. The crawl. Yeah. So I was watching that, you know, that's annoying. Yeah. And then they got onto the running bit and me mates in this race. Yeah. Now they do the side shot, don't they? So you can see who's in the lead. Sure. And then they do that front shot where it's absolutely pointless. The only reason to do the front shot, I. I think, is to keep women interested because you can basically see his tackle going from left to right being battered all over the place. Why were you looking? Seriously, you had no choice if you wanted to watch it. It was like, I was interested if he was going to win, but it's like, you know, watch Charlie's Angels instead. Because I wanted to see if he won the race, but. Well, flip back at the end. Just flip back to get the result. If you don't or at least turn away or close your eyes. Suzanne was happy. Suzanne was loving it. Yeah. And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah, just go to the other shot. But they were showing you the front shot. And running along there. They could have just shown the top half but they didn't. Sure it was there. It's just heads moving along at 25 miles an hour. Yeah, Well, I think you're meant to see the running. The actual legs. Moving is athletics coverage, isn't it? It's not like. But they don't show you a shot from behind. Did you want that? I know I didn't want that. It sounds like you were disappointed. Yeah. Play a record. What? We're having better radio ad. Yeah, we really didn't want it last week. You remember we began the show by talking about knobs. Yeah. I think we've got a bit more mob news this week. Nobody's coming up. Is it Radiohead. More. Radiohead and go to sleep. That's not to you. Please don't go to sleep. We've got another hour and 35 minutes of fun chat and great, great music on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Pilkin. Okay, man Pilkers. Little baldy twat. Mank. Whinging a little bit bent. Pilkers. There he is. There he is there. Now, Rick, you may remember that last week we opened with some quality knob news. Knob news. Yeah, it was. It was Hitler's. Hitler's knob. Hitler's knob was one of them that just. That just sparked off into a whole bunch of other knob related discussions. And I'm pleased so far to see that we're almost at the halfway mark for this first hour and so far we've only talked about nudity and or todgers. So excellent work from us. Well done, lads. I'm looking forward to Dr. Fox and the rest of the Sony Award Committee listening to this one. Yeah. But more knob news. I don't know if there's jingle for that maybe. Oh, he nearly had the eye out. Knob news. Knob news. Excellent. This is an extraordinary story. A woman tried to sue her bosses for 210,000 pounds after finding a cooked penis in a canteen stew. Hospital cleaner Sophie Something something I can't pronounce that name, was eating goulash for lunch and could not cut one of the lumps of meat. You can see where it's going. I've got so many questions already. I know. She picked it up and tried to chew it, but it was too tough. Then she inspected it with workmates who all agreed it was a penis. Imagine that discussion. Yeah. Yeah. Ms. Matlauta said she vomited for the rest of the Day instantly became a vegetarian and had to have psychiatric help. It's not known whether the organ was from a human. The case continues. Well, it can be found out. So that's one thing. Obviously, that doctors aren't confused. They're not going, I don't know, I've never seen one like it. Also, why is she eating goulash? I mean, that is my first question. Why? Yeah, you got your. Oh, lunch. Oh, what do you want? I don't know. Fancy some goulash? Yeah. Oh, some goolie lash indeed. Lancashire cockpot is on the menu. Only £5 50. Wangers and mash. I'd love some wangers and mash, please. If you've got any knob related puns. Knob food related puns, then call XFM on 342-614-094. Ricky.gervais@xfm.co.uk Call Chris Miles at radio1.xfm.wingen mank. Yeah, cocker van. It's already done for. Listen, there's Wangs and Max. Cocker van. Luggage cockpot. You know that's just off the top of our brains. Yeah. So if you've got any of your own, keep them to yourself. We're not interested. What'd you make of that knob news? And he's in a hospital. I don't think so. Oh, yes, it was a hospital cleaner. You're right. Oh, God. I know what your mind's thinking already. There's been a mix up. That's been a mix. What kind of mix? I love that. What? Some blokes gone in, some lesbians gone in. Want a sex change. She's got a carrot for a cartoon steak. Oh, that would be great. You're not a doctor, you butcher this. Not funny. There is some. Some other news whilst we're doing the nod news. Just cram this one in. There was some story on some news website about some lad who wasn't happy with what. What? What had been given. Right. What do you mean? He had it. He had an op. No, no, no. He wanted to have an op. He wasn't happy with what God had given him. Yeah, yeah. What, the Lord had popped downstairs for it. Sure. Sorry, the. Wait a minute. Was he a bloke who wanted it? Yeah, fella. Yeah, fella. And what he wanted, he didn't want a knob or he wanted a bigger knob. What? A bigger one. Right, okay. Cost five grand. Right. And they made a mess of it. Well, what do they. How do they make a mess of it? You know, it came out smaller than they went in with no. What do you mean? I don't know. All the ins and outs. Oh, God. He borrowed the money. There's been a slight mix up. He borrowed the money off his mum. I love that. How bad is that? What do you want for your birthday, son? Yeah, interesting. Thanks, man, for asking. A couple of bits of news as well. Hello, Doctor. How did it go? Well. Well, firstly, don't look under the bandages and don't have the goulash for lunch. It was smaller than you went. We got five grand. Why? Just give me that, tell me what it's for. You can have it if you tell me what it's for. Well, look at that. Oh, you need a big one. Yeah, definitely. There's the money. On you go. Nothing can go wrong. What did he say to the doctor, then? That's rubbish. I didn't read all the ins and outs. I just. Like I said, I saw. Just look for the picture. They want a picture. But you just thought. Well, thanks for. You just thought you'd pop that one in. Thanks. Yeah, that's the end. Knob news extra time record, Carl. So if you've got any knob news, we've got one more show left. Send that to ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk and we'll hopefully get that Knob News on there next week. Yeah, some Dizzy Rascal. Oh, Dizzy Rascal. Yeah, he's one of the hot new English rappers. Let's play it. Dizzy Rascal, apparently, according to Carly, hails from Bo. If he's listening. Good work. We have a number three hit with that. XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais. Reading a magazine. Carl Pilkington in a good mood today. So everything to play for some adverts. Loosen your hold South. That's great. And I love that one. On XFM 104.9, I'm Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant and Kyle Pilkinson. Good choice for it. Good choice for it. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. What are you thinking, Carl? What you been doing this week? What's been going on? Yeah, you'd be miserable. Miserable because of the heat, obviously. That's getting me down. Yeah. It's just the way people wander about as well with Next and out on. Yeah. I'm always amazed by the men because there's a certain breed of man sometimes it's kind of builders, mechanics, taxi drivers, van drivers, but not necessarily students, all sorts of guys. And you sort of watch them walking down the street. They'll be walking down the street. Girls, you know, we'll see. In their sort of summer gear. And it's literally, you know, eyes. Look at those legs. Oh, knockers. Oh, I can't believe I like. Oh, you know, they're sort of talking to their mates. They're checking it. Oh, it's an arse. I can't believe it. Oh. And it's like. It's like they sort of forget. There's like some kind of amnesia that sweeps over them during the winter. Like it's a surprise. Yeah. And then it's like every time summer rolls around again and girls pop. I can't believe it. Where have they been? They're back. Yeah. And they get so excited. Excuse me now. Have you had tits in there? All windows. Oh, yeah. It's great to see him again. Yeah. Where've it gone? They just don't say anything. They just don't get on with it. They're reminded. They completely forget. Yeah. For sort of half a year. There was a fellow this morning, I just nipped out, having a cup of tea, reading the paper, reading that bit about nudists and that. Sure. And little old fella, Must have been 75. Okay. Walks past. Shoe, socks, sort of shorts. But because he's old, I don't think he's got, like, a normal pair of shorts with, like, suit pants, but short, really smart shorts I've never seen before. Yeah. But the thing is with him being old and thin. Yeah. It's just. Don't do that. Don't walk around. Well, the legs. The legs in the back. He looked like a little tortoise without his shell. I always wanted to see a daughter shell on. Yeah. Just to see if it would run really fast and go, this is brilliant. Just scamper along. I saw. Grotesque thing I saw. I think it's Britain's fattest man. I'm not sure. He was huge. I mean, I don't wish him any ill, but so big. It was ludicrous. He was waddling down Oxford street and he was. I mean, genuinely, you know, I'm not a big fan of, you know, ginormous people. Rit Waller, for instance, turns my stomach. This guy was twice as big. He was extraordinary. And he sat down on a big bench and literally took up the whole space. And he reached into his bag. He's having his lunch, and he was eating an apple. And I really felt like I wanted to slap him on the back and go, he's a bit late for that, mate. It probably started now. He's probably starting thinking that I'm gonna Make a change. And imagine if you'd have said that. Yeah. And he'd have. It'd have been awful, wouldn't it? Yeah. He took. He cut it in half, put it between two slices of chocolate. I don't know how you get it. And waited for a pig to come past, shoved it in his mouth, swallowed it. I don't know how he gets that big. And he was like. He'd come out to sort of soak up some of the sun, you know. We look better with a tan. Yeah, yeah. Was he wearing loose black clothes? He was. Of course, that works up to a point. Yeah. And then, you know, it's not falling anywhere. Vertical stripes. Yeah. To make it look just. People just walk past and think it's night. Yeah, exactly. So, Carl. So. So that's. That's, you know, that's been annoying me with the weather on that. Yeah. And then I love the warm weather, although I can't sleep at night. I had two hours in front, just went and lay down in front of the window, in front of the French window, just because it was just too hot last night. But if I can sleep, I love that weather. I love working moment. It's sunny, it's better for you. People are usually happier in that way that the sun is good for you. I mean, it has been hot. I mean, it's 100 degrees. It's probably too hot to work, but mental account. I can't think straight and stuff, you. Know, your little baldy head, isn't it bad for it? Because it just doesn't get. You make your brain a little bit hot. Well, I mean, I'm just got my head on show. What about the nudists? Worry about them before you worry about me. Right. Another. Another thing that happened in the week, you know, I've just had builders round, so. In the kitchen, out. Yeah, sure. So virtually skin. Another problem happens. Boiler starts playing up. Right, Right. So. And you gotta have a shower in this weather. You gotta be able to have a shower on that and freshen off and what have you. Well, I'll shower every day anyway. I mean, two sometimes, but. Yeah, yeah, but if you haven't got any hot water, you can't, can you? Right. Cold showers. All right, go on. So anyway, so fella comes round. Yeah, ninety quid. Ninety quid. Ninety quid. All it did turns up, says, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, just bang it. Bang the boiler. 90 quid. Last time I banged a boiler, it cost me 90 quid. And there was. There was a lot of leakage then So I know, you know, I understand where you're going. Yeah, I do sympathize. But, you know, like, I. I catch them out as well, you know, like, you know, I know that they're up to no good and stuff. They don't earn the money. Sure. And it was in the bathroom. So I sort of creep up and I try and stick my head around. The door to see what he's broke. In the bathroom. Right. That's weird, isn't it? So you creep up to a man in the bathroom and put your head around without seeing you. Go on, though. Fair enough. Right, do you want to go over what happened that time when we're in the pub and I go to the toilet and you're trying to get in? What happened? Is that normal? Go on, what happened? I'm not ashamed. What happened? Go on, say it, say it. What happened? Well, don't start a story and then don't finish it. Oh, we'll do it later. He was in the cubicle and he got in the cubicle to have a piss to avoid me annoying him, right. So what I did, I got some of that liquid soap. I just put it open and squirted on him. And he came out going, look, it looks like someone's just effing jizzed on me. I've got effing jizz on my back. I had to walk through Soho without me back. I was walking through. So when was it we had to go to the. When we went to the Ivy with those people. Wednesday, something like that. Yeah, we had a business meeting, right. And what I was. We were walking up the Ivy, it was about half 11, and I was going down Old Compton street, and as I got to just going past Mamma Mia, something hit me on the shoulder. I looked down and obviously it was Bird. But just for. Just for a split second, I thought it looked like jizz. And I. I just thought, oh, God. Because. And I sort of wiped off and I thought, right, I went on, I gotta wash my hands and, like, get in. It obviously wasn't. It was. It was pigeon shit or something, right? But I. I had this pamphlet once when I was at Yulu. Terrence Higgins Trust left this pamphlet, and it was all stuff like safe sex. And it was stuff like. Honestly, I swear, it said things like, you don't have to have full. Of course. It said, you can do lots of other things with your lover. Like, it said, like. Like, come into some fruit. Eg. A melon. It says, with friends, just come on the back of One of them. Right. And then this is the bit that made me think. And I thought, oh, my God. When I looked down, sort of on my shoulder, it says, come out of a window. Yeah. On any passing celebrity. Oh, God. Oh, gotta get that pamphlet. If anyone's got that pamphlet, it was brilliant. So. Yeah, good. Right, well, let's play around. Do you reckon Nile Edmonds did stuff like this on his show? He's back. Oh, dear. Shyness is nice. Smith. And ask Alexa FM 104.9. Before the. Before that, we had. We had Spunky News. Spunky News coming up. Monkey News. That's the sort of linked. This is Dr. Fox is no better than this. No, you must see we're getting better now. Have you got any other news there, Carl? Well, you were just talking about bird muck. What a classy show this is. Yeah. I imagine someone just having a barbecue tuned into this. Yeah. Can you turn the radio off? He's talking about coming out of windows again, darling. It's putting me off me sausages now. What? I was walking down, down the street and this pigeon sparrow, whatever, did its thing and it landed on me air and I was like, oh, God. So I thought, I'm not gonna wipe it off. Why not? Because I don't want to get it on my hands. I thought I'd leave it till I get home, so it's probably. So you went to work, went on the po. Best man so often speeches. That is brilliant. It was on there for, I don't know, half an hour or something like that. Brilliant. Get home. And did it not kind of slowly ooze down your neck? No, no, it's fairly hard. Right. And corroded me here. What are you talking about? Why did you leave it there, then? Why not just wipe it off with something? Pop in a news agent, buy some. Tissues, then I look stupid. Where is the birds muck on your ear? Brilliant. They're all. They're all wearing that now. But no, it's alkaline. It's really strongly alkaline, isn't it? Or is it acidic? I don't know, maybe someone knows. Is Bird Mark acidic or alkaline? But it is corrosive. Yeah. It didn't seep into your brain. Listen, do you want to do. Do you want to set up Songs of Phrase? Yeah. If you've not heard the show before. I thought we were doing this this week. No, we'll do it once. Right. And then next week's the last one, so we'll do Rockbusters. That might Be the last one ever. Depending on whether Carl decides to come back in October or not. I'll tell you, I'm bored of it. Why are you bored with it? I get bored quick with stuff. Yeah. I told. I told Suzanne the other night. I was lucky. She was. I haven't got rid of her yet. She's things. Did you put on a soft music though first? Yeah. You didn't just like start getting that right, you know, You're a very lucky girl. Sorry? Well, I usually get bored with you and that. Yeah. Oh, dude, you're lucky you haven't pissed off. Yeah. Do you want all the champagne or what? Well, she was annoyed. Oh, what's that on your ear? Don't worry about it. We're walking to the pictures. Right. To go and see Bruce Almighty. Sure. Why? Just something to say in it. Yeah. So you were. You were trying to sneak in the back. So on the way, cutting across Leicester Square and those fellas who sell roses, he comes over. Do you want one? Do you want one? So don't do that. She's allergic to him. Right. So. So we'd go away. Yeah, she got all annoyed about that. Because she's not allergic to them. Well, she's not allergic, no, but they're about three quid each. But the point of mankind is not that she really wants a rose, it's that you're willing to spend three pounds. On her taking us to the pictures. How much was that? That was eight quid each. Did you pay for it though? If I know you, you had her dressed up as a small child. Me and my son, please. Or you've made her sit on your shoulders and wear a long coat. Yeah, exactly. Anyway, listen, songs are for a son. You paid for it at. And then you went another pint while she watched this. Yeah. There's no point both of us seeing it. But tell me about it. Tell me what it's like. Oh, right. Songs. So let's explain what songs are. Phrases. You do it. Okay. Oh, really? If you think that Carl is bored with life, then you will be even more bored once you have heard this particular quiz. The gist of it is that Carl has taken a well known phrase. Well, no, stop me there. Not a well known phrase, somewhat that. He said once on this show. Yeah, probably. And he's somehow compiled together a number of different songs which have somehow built up that particular phrase or sentence. If it's anything about Chinese people, Philip Bailey will be involved. That's all I can say. Okay, let's hear it then. Carl. All right. I don't know what that was. This is appalling. This is appalling. Cow. Cow. I do not know what that is. What is the phrase I just was. Saying last week about everyone's raving about Galileo. No, they're not. No, they're not. No, they're not. That sounds like a sort of B side from the Buggles. Everyone's raving about Beyonce and Robbie Williams. They're not. They're not. People going pop idol. What are you into? Galileo's good. Forget it. Forget it. No placebo song for Carl there. That's Special Needs on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilgrimton. We were doing Songs of Free. Oh yeah, I forgot about that. Oh, God. So what is this phrase? What is the phrase, Carl? Last week we're talking about Galileo. Right. And I just was saying years ago, I can't remember now, when was it? When was he doing his thing? End of the 16th century, I think. Right. And he was messing about, trying to find out about speed of light or something, is it? No, he did lots of. He did lots of stuff going along. All I was saying is surely everyone was saying, stop messing with that. Make us a telly, you know, I mean there was other things that people would have been happier with. Sure. Back then. So the phrase is. The phrase exactly is what? The well known phrase is what? Galileo. Oh, it goes like this. Television. So it's Galileo. Stop talking to me about science. Make me television. Make me television. Yeah. So you email in with. With the bands and that. Brilliant. Right. That is rock bottom. I mean, the welding phrase being Galileo. Stop talking to me about signs. Make me television. That's a well known phrase is the. One of the weirdest things I've forget. Jizz out of windows and things like that. That is the weirdest thing I've heard on radio as a competition. Can we have that one next week? Okay, well, here are the prizes. If you think. Rick, if you think the quiz has hit rock bottom, wait till I tell you. These prices. Brilliant. Oh, I know that we're very much pushing new music on XFM and it's an alternative music station. So you'll be pleased that we're giving away. Now that's what I Call Music 55. Featuring the likes of Busted and Daniel Bedingfield. Brilliant. You really know how to cater to our audience, don't you? The best dance album in the world. That includes DJ Sammy Scooter and Liberty X. Look forward to that this is not so bad. Nick Cave in the Bad Seeds. A live DVD of a Pardon me A performance and some. Pardon me again. But anyway, that basically sums up the prizes. So I won't tell you the rest. They're all monotonous. But anyway, I think those crisps Rick, have gone down the wrong way or. Although I was eating goulash earlier. Sorry. I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. So anyway, yeah, that's. That's some of the prizes and you can win some tat if you can identify these artists. A well known phrase. Galileo still told me about science. Make me television. But easy this week, I think those. Yeah, Play record Kyle. I mean it's ridiculous. Ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk the Pixels the Pixies on XFM 104.9 holiday song. You're talking about people coming around and just banging the boiler and charging 90 quid. I think it was last Christmas. We had a dripping tap, right? And it started off, just dripping a little bit. And then after a cut, I thought, you know, we'd get that sorted out. We couldn't actually turn the tap, couldn't. It was just solid whether the. The wash would gone. And then over Christmas, like, it's like, that's before Christmas, it just started flowing. It was just like on. And I was thinking, this is terrible. It was totally worse. It was a hot tap and of course everything's caretaker going away. Everything had been closed down. So I called out an emergency plumber Christmas. Yeah. But he couldn't get it. Just turn the top off, right? So he was trying to try and in the end he said, well, what I could do is I could just squash the pipe, right? Cut the pipe and squash it and then you could change the whole thing. All right, yeah, whatever, right. Because I can't have this, I guess. So I gotta go to the van. And he got this tool, came up to squash pipe. It's only young man, right? Wasn't strong enough. So I had to help him squash the pipe, right? He squashed the pipe, cut it, put a little nozzle on it, you know, just to seal it, right? And I was underneath. Quid. 180 quid. And I want to say, surely that's half mine. Yeah, I helped it and I was sort of being sarcastic. Well, Johnny was there. I was going, how much was that tool you. He went, it was only about nine quid. I went, pay for yourself in it. Yeah. I was going, could I get one of them? He's going, yeah, get them anywhere, obviously, yeah. And then he went, I wrote a check around an eight quid. And he went, oh, I didn't charge you for the nozzle on the end. I went, no. He went, I said, how much is that? Then? He said, 2:50. So I'll give you cash for that. £2 50. £182 50. So he hadn't even really sorted the problem. But what can you do? What can you do, you know, he wasn't ripping me off. That's the prices. Yeah, he's not gonna go, I'll tell you what, mate, because you helped me call it quits, yeah, buy me lunch. It's not gonna happen. Yeah. My mate was locked out of his flat once and he went out and shut the door behind him and that was it. And he'd look through letterbox and he could see his keys, right? Phone the locksman, says, look, can you come round? I can see my keys, right, let's just have to go out. And he went, well, yeah, but I don't know. I said, I'm trying, it's 90 quid. And he went, 90 quid, but I can see the keys. He went, yeah, I can get them for you. And he went, and my man said, you're gonna come round, you're gonna charge me 90 quid and you're gonna scoop my keys up with a bent coat hanger. And the locksmith said, have you got a bent coat hanger, mate? It's brilliant, but it's a fair point, isn't it? Point. That's it. And what, what can you do? Yeah, I'd have gone, ha, thanks for the expert advice. And then asked a neighbor for a. Bent coat hanger and they went, well, we call it under quid. Yeah, but that's more expensive than locksmith. Well, yeah, because you're going to illegal traders. Exactly. We've got no license. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We can't play a little bit more in case we get fined. Exactly. That's. That's what was going on when, you know, the. The fellow was around the other day fixing the boiler in the bathroom. Just wanted to make sure that it was. That he was working on it because it all went quiet in there. He had the door shut. I'm trying to have a little quick, quick sort of peep, seeing if he's doing anything. Just pushing the door slowly and he's going, don't come in. He's like, what are you doing? Well, what was he doing? I don't know. But then he's like three down. Probably doing a crossword again. That's what annoys me, the way that, you know, it's all secret. You're not coming in. And you hear the odd bang now and again. He's probably sat there, crossword, three down. Giving it the old. Just now and again, with his foot just kicked. Just annoying. How much did you charge you? It's just under 90 quid. Yeah, yeah. And all he said was, you know, give it a bang. If you don't work again, give it a bang. What does that mean? Is that an air block? And they're just like, what's it? I don't know. It's not that complicated. You wouldn't think a boil is that complicated. It's not like understanding, you know, how a fast breeder works or a computer. It's a big lump of metal without water in it. How can we not know that? We're discussing. Yesterday, me and Glenn were trying to work out how a fridge works. Right. It's pretty cool. Magic. It is. The magic comes down the electricals into the frozen peas. That's what I thought. Yeah. Yeah, I know. It's something to do with the. The hydrofluorocarbons can exist at much lower temperatures without freezing. So when they're entering the fridge, sort of under pressure as they flow around, because they're. The. The pressure goes down, they take energy from the. The. It's perhaps a discussion to have in. But not on the air. I still can't figure out. I've never quite understood how a plane stays in the air. It always unnerves me when I'm in. A plane turning a tap on, getting water. Basically gonna go, gargo's walking. Yeah, yeah. Here's a bit of science for you. Go on. Right. Read the other day, yeah. If your dog of a girl, right, God, started digging, say, in wherever. The Trafalgar Square, right? You dig a big hole and you keep digging and you go right through the earth right out to the other side. Yeah. So you. Somewhere in Australia or something, right? Yeah. And then you go back to. Come back again, come back to London, right? Stand next to the owl, jump in it. Apparently you can jump through the world in 42 minutes. It's interesting. But then I was thinking, will you fall? And then when you come out the other end, would you fall back again? Well, yeah, you would, wouldn't you? What would happen is you'd accelerate 10 meters per second per second to the center of the earth. But, you know. But you'd have such Inertia. You'd nearly go as far out the other end before it was like a bungee jump. So you'd nearly get as far as the other end and then you'd go back again and you'd keep going until back and forth, getting, getting further and further away from making it until you went sort of back and forth in the center and then you'd stay still in the center. Have you drilled a hole through the. Oh. Get in touch. Email xfm.co.uk. and just let us know how you got on. Did you get to the other side? Did you get to Australia? Did you buy one of those funny cork hats? Did you see Paul Hogan? How does a fish work? Darkness growing on me. Xfm 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. I bored. I lost him denying a little conversation. Yeah, you were talking about quantum physics to me. Yeah, I was explaining what a black hole was because we were talking about that as well last night and just halfway through he just went, yeah, yeah. And put his headphones on. Brilliant. Yeah. The thing about cars, he speaks with such authority about things that he thinks he knows about. And when you try. Yeah, and when you try to explain to him about stuff, you know, he thinks he goes, no, of course ghosts exist. And he's trying to explain to him why it's conceivable they don't. Ah, no, no, you can't. He can't be bothered with that. Yeah, you did all you Learned in about 12, didn't you? Yeah, but I'm still picking bits up now. Said without irony. What have you learned recently? Anything interesting recently? You've learned Darwin. That's why I was asking you about him. Right, yeah. Darling, we know what do you did. Do you? I don't know what he did. I just read the other day that they've. They've got a treatment for whatever illness he had, so that's a bit late. Imagine that. Saying that to his family. What did Darwin do? What did Darwin do? I don't know. You were, you were just trying to explain it to me. But I'm busy doing stuff, aren't I? I can't take it all in whilst I'm sorting the ads out, putting CDs in, you know, I mean, kicking off the knob news. No, but he formulated the theory evolution based on natural selection. Yeah, but wait, wait though. Do you think that's good? Do you think he's sitting there. Well done. You impressed with that? Because you're not impressed. Things like, you know, you famously said Newton, so it said gravity, but it was already there. If we'd have been floating around, it'd been a problem. We weren't, so keep out of it. That's what you said. You said Einstein. I've never used EMC squared in my life, but the bloke invented the recorder. I watch one a week. So I wonder if you're impressed by Darwin formulating, I think, the most important scientific theory since Newton's laws. Has it made a difference or. Or whatever he said would have happened anyway. You can't do that. You're not allowed to say that. You can't say, oh, well done. I'd have found it eventually anyway. You can't do that. You've got to give people their due. Do you know what I mean? But. But now it's difficult to find stuff because there's less to find out now. Huh? It's not a competition. On what scale? On what scale are you looking at? Why do you mean there's less to find out? Well, no, I mean they're bringing stuff out that. Do you know what I mean? It's just the ipod. Well, yeah, sure. Didn't see the point in that. He actually listed the three songs he'd ever want to carry around with him. I can't remember. They were. What are the three songs? Georgie Killing Georgie. Yeah, yeah. What else? Probably have Elvis in the ghetto, Right. Moving, living in the city. You know why? Do you know why that? Because that's. That's like a little film to him. Yeah. That's three songs where there's a little story. He knows the ending. Yeah, but it's someone singing it to him a little. Just put them on it. I thought, how many songs can I hold? Put that on seven half thousand times. Sure. Well, you don't need to, do you? I mean, that is like that joke, the. The wish. Imagine putting on seven half hours. Yeah, that joke about, you got three wishes, it says, a never ending bottle of Guinness and he goes, second wish. You're gonna have two more of these. Yeah, that's. You don't need to put them on seven and a half thousand times, do you? No, you don't have to. Never mind, Carl, never mind. Answers rushing in. We should point out for the quiz, most of them agreeing that it's pointless. Some people have called it Songs of Phrase. Of course, some people are referring to it now as Songs of Arsenal, which is more than appropriate. But you'll be pleased to know that it's ending this week and next week we've got the return of the even more pitiful Rockbusters for the last one. That's back for the last one. We perhaps also need your petitions to Carl. If you want us to stay on the air, then you need to petition Carl giving good reasons why he should stay, why this show isn't boring, or rather why he shouldn't be bored by it. I mean, you're bound to be bored as listeners, but obviously he's running out of steam now. What are you fed up with? You're just fed up with in general. I mean, you want your Saturdays back. Do you just want a bit of. A life back, that's all. But you don't do anything with your life. Why don't you do this instead of, like your day job? Can't. It's more important than midday job in it. That's what earns the company money and that. I mean, wow. So what you do, why don't you do a regular show, then sack someone who's, you know, quite frankly, not putting away? I did that years ago. What do you mean, done it? Told you. I've done a lot of stuff. Boxing done. Tick dancing done. No, you turned out the place was shut. Dancing. When did you do dancing? That's right. When he went and said, I want to do dancing. And he went along to the place and it was shut and that was it. And he said, anymore. That's not doing it, is it? Boxing. He had a fight with one lad, then the lad beat him up and he didn't go again. Oh, dear. It's pathetic. Well, anyway, yeah, so this is basically our penultimate show. Next week's the Final and we're all looking forward to that enormously. Yeah, but that may be it forever then. And this, this, you know, all for One. All, you know, one for all for One. The Three Musketeers gone forever. Yeah, I, for one. I'll be pleased. Oh, I have to get some of these taped because I like coming in sort of, you know. Incidentally, Rick, don't be afraid to nick as many CDs as you see fit on that last show. People have already nicked them. No, I just take whatever you want. Is that 4 non blondes is still there in it? I think it's still there because I. Don'T want that to be nicked. And I got a feeling there's. Because I don't think there's any Smiths in the library, but there is quite a lot of Gina G. Really. What. What was that, Cy? For. Nothing. Nothing. What? Play Record. Monkey News is on the way. Plus three. This isn't radio. Keep. You gotta keep talking or playing music. Listen. Music. Yeah. Heart of Gold by Neil Young on XFM 104.9. Pop Idol, of course, begins this evening. I know you're looking forward to it, really. Yeah, I love it. It's always a joy. And especially those early rounds with the mentors. Yeah, yeah. They are always extraordinary. That's the only reason I watch. I mean, I can't be bothered with the later contest. It's just watching the freaks for the first couple of weeks. It's an absolute pleasure. Yeah. I sort of like watching the judges. They're good as well. The judges are good, yeah. They've got their little stick. You know, the special jokes I've obviously written just waiting to get them in. Yeah, it's just great. But I love when Pete Waterman cries as well. Does he cry? Sometimes? If he's moved by it, he's better than bloody Bobby Dallin. Like it? Yeah. Rosie Ribbon made him cry. It just wells up and then. That's good. I like that. He talks a lot of old ass, doesn't he? Pete Waterman? I sort of quite like him. I don't know, I find him irritating. Well, it's like he genuinely thinks he's up there with Leonard McCartney. That's one of the great kind of pop Svengales of his time. Yeah. And, you know, you. I don't know, you wrote songs for Sunita. Well, let's not knock them. There's foxes on there. True. No, no. Dr. Fox is a genius. Obviously. You can step in if there's any medical emergencies. Rick Waller, you'll be pleased. Now, I'm obviously, as you know, I'm a huge Rick Waller fan. Not only has he got a great singing voice, but he's. He really is a picture, isn't he? No, I know it's a bit harsh, I've said it before, but he does. He does make me a little sick to the stomach when I look at Rick Waller. And to be honest with you, it's his own fault. You know, he went in Celebrity Fit Club, he had a chance to sort things out and his attitude was wrong and he didn't trim down and he's, for want of a better phrase, a bloater and slightly grotesque. But. But, you know, he's in the paper this week saying that it was all because of his image. He didn't fit the stereotype of what pop star should look like. Blah, blah, blah, Blah. Well, he's disgruntled by this. He's got a great singing voice. Well, he has got a great singing. Voice, but the point is this, Rick. The point is this. Since the days of Elvis, since the days of Bing Crosby, he's not as bad as Elvis. You're a star because you have to have the whole package. The voice, the sex appeal, everything. We know how it works. Kids buy it. It's pop music. That's what pop music is. You know, if you want to be a big fat blow tear, you've got at least be as good as Barry White. He isn't. Or Pavarotti. Or Pavarotti. And so anyway, he set up a. He set up an organization. He's always got a band. So you're saying, get over it. The world should revolve around looks? Well, no, I'm saying pop music. That's what pop music is. I mean, this kind of obsession with. He should get a chance on record. No, I know, but be a session back, be a backing singer. The point is, this kid wants to be a star. He wants to be a star, doesn't he? That's the point. He doesn't want to sing and make a couple of records. He just wants to be a star. I thought that's. That's the real rub, that actually he's not being truthful with himself. He doesn't just want to make beautiful music and sing. Well, he. He wants to be, you know, carried around on a sedan chair and adored. Imagine that. I know. A lot of money to pay for the entourage that can carry four elephants needed. But he's got a company now. He set it up with his dad. It's a management company. It's called Star Search. And basically he's hoping to break the fickle industry, you know, expectations. And so if you're a bit of a grotesque, if you're a freak of some kind, if you're someone that Carl, you know, would be impressed by or, you know, alarmed by, then you can get in touch with Rick and you can put you in there. Women with beards, little fellows, whatever, whatever. It does not fit the usual norms. Should we cut along? I'm thinking the three of us next week. We won't have much to do after next week, you know, Ricky's got a bit of a singing voice on him. I'm learning to play Blowing in the Wind on the keyboard by Bob Dylan. Yeah, it's like a master there. I don't know what you can do. You can dance. You can dance. Can't you? You know that you've done it. You've done dancing too. Exactly. It's like, you know, donkey love a hair at Christmas. Perfect. I'm good at that. What were you meant to be playing when you did Little Donkey in the play? Drums to We Three Kings. But you just busted live, didn't you? We're just talking about looks and stuff. Right. Always. Because, you know, it sort of cheeky freak of the week. We did that. And I stopped doing it. Sure. It was upsetting a few people. There was a thing on the website the other day about Elephant man. Right. Just keeping up to, you know, up on the news. What's going on there? Drunky news. They did a thing about him and what it'd look like if his head wasn't messed up. Yeah. Yeah. And they made a little picture for him. Is he quite good looking? Not bad looking. But he can't use it. It's not like you can't. You can't put it on a passport. Sure. Yeah. Well, and the fact that he's been dead for several years. No, but they also do that sort of thing for people who are alive. They say this is what you look like. So you can't use it for that. You can't use it. That's sort of like rubbing it in though, isn't it, really? Yeah. Unless they said good news. You were ugly anyway. Yeah. Ze got honest. You wouldn't have pulled it. You didn't look like. If you're symmetrical, you weren't a looker. You couldn't use it on a little date and agency picture. This is what I look like. Yeah. This is what I would have looked like. And they throwing up and go, I'm into it. What do you mean would have looked like? Well, I see you as we said seven o' clock. How will I recognize you? I'll be eating buns. Yeah. Look for the giant cauliflower. Yeah. In a goat. Exactly. I love the fact that you're keeping up. Keeping up to date with what the Elephant man might have looked like. Yeah, exactly. That is amazing. Carl's news is largely what's happening in. Around. Around 1880. Yeah, yeah. Or what might have happened. No, but it's sad though. Did you watch that thing in the week that what are you staring at? Program. I didn't know. I couldn't face it. I know what you mean. It was about people who'd had unfortunate deformities. Yeah. Yeah. And it was. It was really sad. I suddenly felt bad about, you know, some of the stuff we'd talked about and what have you. Can I just say something like, that's quite a nice thing. So, about some of the things we talked about, should we go over what we've discussed today? What. What subject have we brought up today? How can you feel sorry about things like that when we're still doing it? No, I'm just saying, you know, you have a laugh and that, but then you see a program about it and you go, oh, what? You realize they're real people you're talking about? Yeah. When do you ever forget that? When do you ever forget that? When you bring up these cheeky freaks of the weeks or when we talk about Rick Waller. That there's not a real person on the other end thinking about it. Yeah. But sometimes it's hard because they don't look like real people. Don't snag off, Rick. That girl was on with a big head. It's like BO selector. We played some dizzy rascal earlier and that was wicked. Exactly. And he's the new kind of. The kind of London rap sensation. Yeah. Let's not forget credit to The Nation from 1994, Birmingham. Now, Steve, whatever happened to MC Fusion? He got a lot of bad press at the time. People didn't respect him. But I'm listening to that now. I think it was bloody brilliant. Yeah, all right. And crucial. Exactly. Adverts. Kings of Leon, Molly's Chambers on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais, you're Steve Merchant. And that little. This little bald head, a mank over there is Carl Pilkington. Cockaliki soup. Cockaliki soup is fine. That was one from Nick. Thanks for that, Nick. Yeah. Referring to the woman who chewed on a knob in a goulash. Exactly. If you just tuned in, you've missed that. Hilarious. Yeah. We still don't know why she was eating goulash. I've got a rash, look. Come up my arm. Look at that. Brilliant. Fascinating. Thanks for that. That's from rubbing his head, getting him an edlock. And have you got some on your hair? Because. Look at that. That's like a heat rash. What do you wash your hair with? Have you still got that bird behind your ear? What is that? That's really worrying, isn't it? It's like how, like, the body changes over many years of sort of certain things. Yeah. It's like your body changes to protect yourself from the sun and what have you. Yeah. My head just got used to being rubbed. Yeah. It's reacting now. That's a defense mechanism. All right, I see. All right. Look at that. That's horrible. Anyway, something on your hair. You know, Monkey News. Well, I was gonna say the winner. I don't think anyone cares. Oh, come on. Someone got all of them, didn't they? Well, okay, play it again then. This was Songs of Phrase. We did this. The well known phrase is Galileo. Stop talking about science. Make me Television. Please. Television. The most convoluted, banal quiz on any radio station ever. I mean, I'm including Mos. Chris Evans. Do you know what I mean? Simon Bates. That's worse than anything they ever did. Apparently Channel 5 have bought the. Right, anyway, what the answer is called. We had Queen in There. Altered Images. Thomas Daldy. Yeah, Beatles. Aretha Franklin and Red Oak Chili Pepper. Well, extraordinarily, Tracy and John Burton from Colchester and Essex got all of those. Right. Why they would want the prices, I have no idea. But good luck to them. They can enjoy those at some points. God bless. Okay, Monkey News. Do you want a bit? Yes, please. This rush is weird. Oh, chimpanzee that. Monkey News. Right, they were filming a documentary, right, this telly company. Yeah. Doing a documentary. Which one? Which one? Which one? Don't know. No, what was the documentary about? Not monkeys. Yeah, where was it? Right. When was this? I've got a date. Okay. Recently, though, since the Avenue. Television, obviously. Yeah. Actually, a bit of extra monkey news if you want it. Okay. Always. Do you know the Monkey News extra? Go on. Do you know the Halfords ads? Halford's ads? I don't think so, no. What happens? Alfred's. They've, you know, they sell nuts and bolts and stuff. Right? They were using monkeys in the ads. Okay, yeah. And what happened? Don't they sell bikes, Alfred? Well, mainly bicycles and motorbike stuff in there. Okay, so, yeah, so they're using monkeys in the oven. What happened? I can't handle it. I can't do this. Look at him, look at him. I don't care what he's doing. Well, basically, right, they've. There was a load of hassle because they were using these monkeys in this alpha tadvert. Yes, and what happened? Get to the point. It turned out there wasn't a problem because they were mechanics in the first place. Well, they were monkey mechanics, yeah. What are you talking about, Mental? What are you talking about? That's not a story. Anyway, listen, let's get. Let's get back onto it. There are mechanics in the first place. All right, listen, right, so they're making this documentary Right. And stumble across a little gang of. Little gang. Come on, just. Get on with it, please. Little gang of monkeys. That's the first time I've ever laughed. I'll hear that. I know. Well, brilliant. What do you want, a cake? Come on. Can we play a song? Oh, I don't understand. What is wrong with you, you freak? It's making me laugh. Just tell us the story. All right, then. All right, so anyway, right, so there's this. This documentary being made. They found a little gang of monkeys. Right. Play a song. I don't know what's going on here. I apologize. It's just if you were looking forward to. Monkey Gotta hide your love away According to the Beatles on XFM 104.9. I'm making you raise with me Steve Merchant. Right, Carl, come on. Everyone's composed the jingle, please. Oh, chimpanzee that monkey news. Excellent. Okay, Right, where were we? We would just start again. There's some people making a documentary. What? Okay. Making a documentary in. In the jungle and that. Right. Stumble across a little gang. Okay, okay, come on. All right. A little gang of monkeys. Yeah. Come on. So the camera crew are there filming it. Yes. Everything's going normal. Nothing odd about it. Okay. They don't. They're not running a restaurant. They've not got any barbershops. Nothing. No, just regular monkeys going about their business. Yeah. So anyway, what normally happens is the monkeys sleep with the partner. They don't sort of sleep around in that. Once they find the girlfriend or the boyfriend or whatever. Yeah. They stick with them. Right. But anyway, they were watching this one, right. And it's. It's going around a bit. Sleeping around. And it was getting fatter. I thought, this is a bit odd. Yeah. Right. So followed it round and see it having it away. Turns out, little prostitute. Oh, God, it's a little monkey prostitute. It was getting fatter because it was charging him bananas. Load of old charging bananas. What was it, a boy or. It was a woman. Little woman monkey. That's the most extraordinary monkey news I've ever heard. Oh, that is genius. Has this documentary been televised? I don't think it's been on yet, no. And that's all the information you've got? Yeah. And. And is that. That's. That's one banana for everything. The half a banana is for just oral. A poor job. Right. If you want full blown monkey sex, it is two and a half bananas. Sure, sure. Let's just play a song. All right, well, this is our penultimate show, which we'll be back next week. We're going to make it a barnstormer, I'm sure. Lads, I want 100 behind 110 next week. All right? None of this giggling. None of this infantile giggling like two schoolboys. We're going to come back. We've got some quality monkey news next week. We're going to have all kinds of treats, I would think. Okay? Some great prizes. All right? Okay. Yeah. Let's make next week the best show ever. Good luck. If you miss it, then you miss out. We're ending with a track from a couple of years back, I think it was 92. 93. Dinosaur Jr. Start chopping. Play that. Start playing. Forget start chopping, start playing. All right, all right. See you next week. Yeah.",
