They'll have to order a new dj. All right. That was genius. Hey. Oh. Simple as that. I'm Ricky Gervais. Steve Mitchell and Carl Pilkington. Oh, man. Did anyone read the Guardian yesterday? It was Steve's big. We. We interviewed together. I've never been interviewed before in the paper. I've certainly never had my Photo International. We were very excited. We loved the interview. It was talking about our top ten albums between us. We loved it. We talked really fast, like school kids. We were excited. It was a great interview. And all the way through it was Ricky Gervais with his writing partner, Steve Mitchell. Stephen Mitchell. It's not even like Merchant. He phoned me up the night before and he was cut. And I know he's awful. And it was big letters and just all the way through in the caption. And it's just like, oh, God. But it's embarrassing. Do you know what I mean? It's embarrassing because it's like I was trying to get in the paper. I couldn't believe my luck. And then that just draws attention to the fact that I'm not a celebrity and consequently they can't even remember my name. But the worst thing was that one of my favorite albums of all time, I said in there was Blood on the tracks by Bob Dylan. And I said, because, you know, I think one of those beautiful songs ever is if you see her, say hello. And of course, these people were sort of transcribing it from, you know, a Dictaphone. It came out my favorite song of all time, which. If you see a sailor. If you see a sailor. Hello. Oh, Bob. Bob Drill boids up on the trap with where's the sailor gone to? With Ricky Gervais and Steven Mitchlings. Oh, I don't know. They must have thought my name was. Was Mitchell all along. They obviously never knew. The evidence is there. I don't know why. It was like, they reported in the paper that we'd be nominated for a Sony. And it said Ricky Gervais, who hosts the Breakfast show on xfm. And it's that sort of. It' just guessing. It's like, presumably someone's gone. Did you host show? Someone has gone. Yeah. And that's. That's their research done. Yeah. But there was a thing about the office set in Swindon. That's someone going Just write an article about the office. Where's it set? Swindon, I think. Is it? Yeah. Okay, that'll do. Yeah, yeah. Even we research the show now and again, don't we? Even we look things up while. Actually people phone in. Usually that fella. What's that fella's name that calls in, who's got the website? He's got a funny name. Gilbell or something. James, phone in if you remember what his name is. Yeah, James. James at Lose Control. Yeah. What's his surname, though? Oh, for goodness sake. This is just gonna be interesting to him and his friends. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You remember. We better play another record. I'll tell you what if. Johnny Mango. Mango, that's it. Yeah. Now if you like Alvis Costello's Alison or maybe Freeze. Freeze, My Brother Jay. One of my favorites. Stay tuned. Badly Drawn Boy, Silent sign, cracking tune. Xfm 104.9. Maybe there'll be a few Silent Size around London on the 4th of May when. That's it, we're off the air for we already. Yeah. Wow, you're really getting into the DJ patter today. Yeah. Brilliant. Yeah, it was good. Yeah. It's only taken, what is it, five years? Yeah. Now you're finally as good as Foxy. Coming up. Yes. That anecdote that Carl didn't get to last week about Neil Armstrong. I can't wait. It's because he took three links telling us about the horse. Yes, of course, of course. Think of that. I went out with Carl on Thursday night. Right, right. It was one of the most enjoyable nights we just had. Like went out for about what, five or six pints. A little crawl and adventures happened around Kyle and just me sitting talking to him was just incredible. I'm thinking that a competition would be Win a P with Carl. Yes. Just. They just have to go for a point and they can ask him anything they want. He's just. He's just great. We met on My Friend, didn't we? Tell him all about that. Yeah, yeah. Well, did you enjoy it as much as Ricky, Carl? Yeah, there was things I learned as well, which was good. Okay. You know his mate Robin, don't you? Yeah, yeah, I'll. You'll discuss that later. I'll tell you later. He's got all his near death experiences to come. Winner. And of course, coming up, Carl's homework was the quotes. And Carl's come up with a great idea to show that anyone can do quotes. He's. He's invented a thing like faking it where he's got two real quotes, right? And he's made one up. Okay. And he's gonna fool us. I bet we won't be able to. Brilliant. Sorry, what was the challenge last week? Look at him looking at us. What's the matter with you? It's just that before you were like, no, this is good for you, but now it's turned into a game at your expense. Yeah. Have just. It only just dawned on you, Carl. Well, I'm joking. It's great. Honestly, it's really good. What was the Carl challenge last week? You said it. I thought we did the quotes last week. No, but I gave him a. Happiness. It's all about happiness and what the, you know, pursuit of happiness. And it's in sort of like quote form and everything. But Carl's gonna do a couple ones and faking it just to show, I mean, because he's been coming up with fables all week as well. Now he comes up with something. He goes, that's a favor, isn't it? And he tells me the. So he's. He's getting good now. Looking forward to it all. If you play another track, we got something. You got something special. I saw Alvis Castello on Jonathan Ross a couple weeks ago and he did just an acoustic version of Allison and I forgot what an amazing song it is. And it's just. He's. He's fantastic. He's. He's. He's the man. Listen, this is guitar sound. It's so beautiful. My aim is true to provide quality entertainment of a Saturday and his attractions. And Alison on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. Steve Mitchell here. And Carl Pilkington. Oh, yeah. He's going all right. It's going all right. I obviously been doing some acting, as you know, I mentioned it last week. Doing this, this sort of comedy pilot this week. Car, you're going to be loving this. I've been doing stunts. I swear to God. I've been doing my own stunts with the guy that once made Christopher Reeve fly as Superman. Right. And I was doing stunts. I had to do a thing where I. That my character has to commit suicide. Don't think we didn't bring that up. Were you anywhere near that horse? No. Fine, let's carry on. And I had to. My character has to commit suicide and he has to sort of leap off a building. So the first thing that's a something for comedy. Well, you're up on a roof and obviously they had the crash mats and stuff. And I had to Kind of leap off and land on the mats and stuff. And obviously, I was petrified the whole time because I was wearing my glasses, petrified that they might get broken. So I was, like, not really doing it properly and kind of leaping like. Like what? You know people when they can't dive into a swimming pool. And so they put that one foot out first to sort of break it. Was it you that told me that you. You could never get into fights? No, I can never get into fights or go in a mosh pit because of my glasses. I've missed out in life because I can't. Because if. If I was in a fight and I said, come on, then you are, you know, and I was in a pub or something. They just have to whiff off the glasses, just knock them off. I'm done for. Yeah, but anything's an advantage in a fight, isn't it? And the fact that they're just a blur is bound to hand from my otherwise brilliant, you know, ninja skills. So. So, yeah, I've never got into a fight. I've been in a fight at all. Never been in the mosh pit. So this was making me sort of a bit worried. And anyway, so then I think, well, fine, I've done my stunt. And I did it, and everyone clapped. They were pleased with it. And the guy who said I was really good. So then they drive us to the next location, right? I'm thinking, I've done my stunts. Now there's a crane. I think, what's going on here? Now they need to shoot me. Like, I've already done the stunt where I've sort of left off the building. Now they've got. Actually see me falling, right? So I have to get strapped in with this huge belt, and they click wires onto me and they hoist me about 30, 40 foot into the air on this wire, and I have to. And then they drop me at great speed and I have to scream and shout, you know, it was partly acting glasses. By this time, I'd managed to get some wire fixed to my glasses so they wouldn't come off my head. I assure you, they were stunt glasses. They were doing their own stunts. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. So. So they hoist me into there on this thing. They do a couple of sort of sort of demo versions, you know, and just gradually ease me up higher and higher so I kind of become acclimatized to it. And they get about 30ft up and they got these huge crush mats, like those great big ones you always see stunt people have, and they set up the camera and stuff down below. And while I'm up in the air dangling there, they remove those crash mats and they replace them with those really thin ones that you always see, like teenage gymnasts using on blue pa. Do you know what I mean? The really thin ones used to have at school, right? And I'm looking down at this, I'm thinking now they may as well have shouted up. If you fall, you're done for. But we might be able to protect the equipment. Do you mean it was so rubbish. But you weren't gonna land on the floor, presumably? Well, the idea was that the wire would stop that. Oh, I see. But there was no say that, was there. That was the safety net. Why did they not leave the real ones in? Because they. They had to, I don't know, for the shot and stuff. They had to. They had to be able to do it. But anyway, what was particularly joyful is one of the other actors pointed this out, right? This is the. This is the health and safety statement from the stunt guys, right? And they obviously have to write up this health and safety statement about how they do it. And it says, we confirm that we have proper safety policies, procedures to comply with the Health and Safety Act 1974, and that we will not do anything which compromises the health, safety and welfare of your production crew, actors or members of the public. If the above situation changes, we'll advise you immediately. I mean, if they think that maybe they do want to hurt members of the public, look at that fat one over there. Just try and hit her and bring him down. Don't worry about that one. She can take it, you can take it. But. So that reassured me, obviously. And now my whole body's racked with pain. Limbs, arms, head, neck. Unbelievable. Well, it's a shot worth having. You wish you had. The cameraman whispered to me. The camera whispered to me. He'd probably never use it. Yeah. Steve, you'll wish you hadn't told that wimpy tale when you hear three, just three random tales of near death experiences that Carl told me. Right, coming up. I mean, honestly, really, at least you had stunt people and crash maps. Yeah. You got paid. Yeah. The things that he got up to, just through stupidity, will put you this. What? Which? What, what one what? One of them wasn't through stupidity Cakes. I'm already excited. The cake one. Yeah. Which one's that? So you had a near death experience involving. Hold on, I've got three. I've got the. I've got the paper round the snicking Slate. And the. The Mr. Freeze. What's the cake one? Yeah, I suppose. Look at the cream cake. Oh, yeah. Right. Now you're talking in riddles. You have these next, yeah? Yeah, Please. Cooper Temple Claws. Who need enemies? Good question, lads. Nobody. 6 FM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. Oh, they should print a little book of those. They're great. Oh, how you can relate any song or artist to anything else. Easy, easy. Well, yeah, so me and. Me and Carl went out for a beer and it was. It was great, wasn't it? Yeah. We started off and you met my mate Robbie, didn't you? Yeah. And some of the stories. Do you want to tell Steve some things about Robin? Robin. Do you know him well? Yes. Well, do you know about his. His worm problem as a kid? Go on. Right. He. What I can remember is, he. He had worms as a kid. Not sure how you get him. He never answered me. He was getting a bit touchy about it. This is like the second time I met him. I think he was a bit annoyed that Ricky told me about his problem. What now? What now? Straight away, you not being there, instinctively. What do you think went on with this story about worms? My suspicion, yeah, is rather like when a group of people that Robin had once suckled milk from a cow's udder. Yeah, I. Yeah. Did he mention that as well? Yeah, yeah. My suspicion is that, like the cow story, the worm story is not true. Why would he get so sort of uppity about it? Well, imagine. Imagine if he. That wasn't the first time he'd done it. Imagine if he did that every single time he was with somebody for the first time and Robin was just met them. He tells that. He will tell that story to anyone. But they do say there's no smoke without fire. Poor Robin. I also told him that's a fable. I also. I used to told him that the way Robin cured these worms was because the doctor told his mother, right, to hold a piece of ham or cheese near Robin's anus so the worms would come out for the food. And he believed it. I'll tell you why, though. I said Robin used to sit on Spam to try and get the worms out. And he believed it. But Steve, right, do you remember that story about three or four years ago where there was some bloke in the army, he went away to somewhere, Vietnam or whatever. He was messing about in the woods. Shouldn't he have been fighting? Whatever. Yeah. Right. And he walked through some lake and I think he Caught his toe or something on something. And some worm of some sort crawled in the. In the gash. Yeah. And it was in his body. And the doctor said, we've got to get this out of your body. So what they did was, they said, right, the thinnest part or something of your body that things can crawl through is on the top of your head. So they wrap where the skull is. So they wrapped some bacon. No, they didn't. They did. All right, so he's gone in by the toe. So what we do is. I'll tell you what, that worm's probably heading straight for the head. We'll put a bit of bacon on it. The thinnest part of the body. Is that the skull? Of course it's not the thinnest part of the body. It's where your brain case is, isn't it? It's the hardest. The skull. There was. There was a reason for it and it was like the. They stuck some bacon on his head. As ever, the vital piece of information, I. E. The reason Carl seems to. Have forgotten, because the worm was in. In his body. And they said every. You know, everyone likes the smell of bacon. Including worms. Even a. Even a Vietnamese like worm. Remember last week when I said about the little fellow with the bone with no brain and you were proved wrong? No, no, no, no, no, no. We were saying it wasn't a little fella. We were saying it was a stillborn child. It wasn't a little fellow changing it. Now, you weren't having any of it last night. Right, hang on a minute. Let's just. I'm getting confused. There was a Vietnamese. There wasn't a Viet. There was a Vietnamese snake that went inside of soldier. A little like maggot or some sort that you have to get out your body because it causes problems. Yes. And so in order to get it out of the body, they strapped bacon to his head. That is great. This doctor. And did that work? I think so. They had a picture of him smiling. Oh, what, the worm or the bloke? The bloke. Oh, honestly, I hope someone knows the story. And. Right. Just. It was about three years ago, I reckon. Okay, yeah, it did work. So this is why I. I went. The worm burrowed out of his head to get the bacon. To the bacon. Right. That's great. So this is. This is why, when Robin was telling his story, I was a little bit disappointed if it wasn't true. Right. Because in a way, you know, Robin's. Never been to Vietnam. No. But what I. I would really think that Robin. Well, as Robin said at the time, Carl, why would I sit on Ham then tell Ricky Gervais. It's a very good point. Because if he was a kid. You do daft things like that as a kid. Right. It's the telling Ricky Gervais, though. Yeah. And then. Oh, bless him. Okay. And then. Anyway, then Robin left and I tried to chase him, but he got away. And he knows that we. Yeah. And then we had a few pints and then Carl embarked on some of the greatest stories ever told. Have you. Can you tell the story about your dad? Let me run it. But I haven't spoke to him all week, so let me run it by him. Okay. Play records. You know what we got? We've got one of Steve's. Yeah. Well, bizarrely enough, this comes from the Teachers 2 soundtrack. The soundtrack to the. The current TV series. There's a slight whiff of nepotism in the air. Yeah. Rick, would you like to explain why? Well, that's why you're doing it now. My girlfriend worked on it, but. Yeah. You were gonna play this anyway? Well, I was actually, bizarrely enough, I was going to play some. I Am Clute. And this is from, as I say, the. The Teacher soundtrack. This is called to you. It's a good track. That's I Am Clute. And a track called to you from the Teachers soundtrack. That's also got, I noticed the Electric Soft Parade, the Hives Star Sailor Feeder Train Break, Smoky Rev on there. It's a good little collection. Lovely. Carl has just had confirmation. He's looking smart because someone phoned up and went, it is true. It's a Lao Gai chi worm and you wrap bacon around your head. That's all the bloke knew as well. Yeah. And his name was Gary. Yeah. So I'm not having it. No. And he said. He said, see, that's why the Robin thing isn't so weird. He said. But when you said he tried it with cheese, he said I was having none of it. He's got standards, strokes. Hard to explain. Like Carl, really. Yes, yes. So, Carl, concentrate. So we'll. We'll leave the worm with the bacon wrapped around the head, shall we? Well, if you're ever caught in the jungle. Yeah. Always carry some bit of Danish. Good advice. Lovely. So would you like to start on your To Steve? Because I've heard all these. Well, won't do them all. Well, we'll start off with the. The Mr. Freeze. Tell Steve the story of Mr. Freeze. This is the first time he nearly died. This. This is the most serious of the lot, really. So what it was. Do you know, like, I don't know if your mum and dad did the same thing, but, like, they do the weekly shopping on. On like a Friday. Yeah. So when, when you got to Thursday, there won't be much stuff left in the cupboard. It'd just be like, you know, your Jacob's crackers and stuff like that. So when they'd. When they'd been to the supermarket and they came back, I was like, you know, what's that saying? Like a pig in. You know, I loved it. It was like, loads of food coming in, loads of biscuits. What is that saying? He nearly said pig and. Right. It's not the same. Yeah. Right. So. So, yeah, all this food comes in. Thank God he didn't. Otherwise he'd have been in trouble. That's true enough because he's. He's culpable for our actions because he's a producer. So technically that twats in charge. Gone. Right. So anyway, so there's loads of food and I'm like, oh, yeah, look at this. And chocolate biscuits and, you know, penguins and stuff. Bacon. So I'm bacon. Just in case. You never know. So. So anyway, my mum. Dad's putting the food away. Me and our kid are like, he's already grabbed something. Gone back upstairs. It's like feral children. It's like a quest for fire. And then they run upstairs. What, did he just sit under the bed, gnawing at some sort of pig's trotter? So. So I saw. Do you remember Mr. Freeze Pops? I do, yes. Well, they're kind of like popsicles. Icicles. Yeah, but really long, like a foot long. Right. So I thought, I'll have one of them. So I grabbed it. Went for the nutritious stuff first. Absolutely. And. And like my mom, dad are pointing this stuff away and what have you, and I. I rip it open and knock it back. Right. Straight away. Just right back, like. But it went down the wrong way. Right. So I put down your shirt. So I was like, oh, God, can't breathe. And my mom and dad didn't. Didn't even know what I'd ate. Do you know what I mean? It went. I ate it so. So quick. Yeah. And I'm sort of tapping my mom on the back going. She's going, oh, God. You know, he's choking again. Because I was always choking, if it was one thing. I don't know if I've got like a small throat, but I mean, Even Ricky knows I can't drink that much, can I? Yeah, or eat pebbles. I'm not a quick drink drinker. I'd always. I think I'm scared of, like, swallowing stuff. Yeah. And it was like bottle tops and mint Imperials and stuff. I was always, always choking on stuff. So anyway, she. Oh, God, what's he picked up? And at. Now. Drop it, drop it. His nose with a stick. So I was going, I'm choking at this point. My dad had, like. I think he'd put his. His share away, you know, his food away. And he'd gone. His chair, I love it. He'd gone to watch like, Winner Takes all or whatever in a lounge. And I. I was in the kitchen and I was starting to, like, just. I didn't care anymore. Do you know what I mean? I hadn't. I just got to that point where I wasn't struggling anymore. You just thought, I'm done. I was just like falling to the ground. I mean, Mum's going, you know, getting here. I think it's serious. My dad comes in and sort of starts shouting at me, saying, that's what you get for being greedy. He didn't even know what I'd eaten. Well, it was. It was the moment to teach you a lesson. So he's there like that and my mum's going, oh, look at him. I mean, lips were going purple and my eyes were rolling into the back of my head. Yeah, Marilyn Manson. And so anyway, she grabbed me from behind and did that. That fireman thing. The Heimlich maneuver. Yeah. And, you know, winded me and it came up and I was all right. Well, the whole Popsicle came flying back out. You see, that's what I don't understand. Because there was nothing there. No. Just a little bit. No, it swells up, doesn't it? Because it irritated it. So you went down your. This sort of like your epiglottis. It went down the wrong way. Like it went into your air canal instead of your throat and it sort of, sort of spasms. And that's the. That's the fear. You've got to calm it down and relax. So in time, I would have been all right. Yeah, well, no, you might have. So that's. So, so, so. Hang on. So. But, but, no, but the weird thing is, like, for like three days after that, I felt like a sort of a special person. I was. I went to school, I did full days. A special needs person. Yeah. I went. I went to school the next three days after that. I didn't like wag it or anything. I did full days. I love that. Three days turnover. Exactly. After three days you thought, screw it. Yeah. Did a quick history exam, but have. You ever had that where you've like, felt like, I've been given another chance here. Right, next one. That's Popsicle. That's Popsicle. Hell, we call that. Right, next one. Which one's the next one? Oh, what about your paper round? Right, Can I ask very quickly, did your life flash before your eyes like they say it did? No, I just sort of went really calm and like, I'm ready for this now. Right. I wasn't bothered, you know what I mean? I wasn't. You had no regrets? No, no, it was weird. It was really weird. Yeah. But anyway, the paper round, one paper round. I'd still say it's the best job I've ever had. And he means it. No, I really enjoyed it. It's like, you know, you don't have to work with anyone else, right? So you make your own rules. Just think of that. You know, you're sort of around spreading. Information to people, vital information, giving a. Service and no one else is around. You know, you can just do what you want and think about stuff while she's cycling around on your bike. It's really good. Yeah. So. So anyway, imagine the stuff he's thinking about when he's riding around. Oh, so getting in the head of a salamander. So anyway, I loved it. And even though I only got like 50p a day, right, no matter what the weather was like and stuff, I used to get up at half past four and go and do the round. And why'd you get a bar pass for? Because I wanted to watch the Pink Panther at 5:30, so I wanted to get me paper round done. I said, why didn't you watch the Pink Panther? He went, oh, I can't sit there thinking, I've got my paper round to do. You'll ruin it for him. Yeah. So is it a good job or not? 4:30 I was up, up and about. And this morning it was like, win a really bad winter, Bad snow, you know, freezing cold, really windy and all that. I mean, Mum said to me before I went to bed, she said, don't be getting up tomorrow, I'll give you the 50p. I said, it's not about the 50p. So, you know, people want the papers and stuff. So. So anyway, I went to bed thinking, you know, that's it. I've told her I'm still going, so, you know, whatever, go to sleep, get up in the morning and put all my kit on. And I used to have layers of clothing on because it was really cold. They had, like a big anorak on with the fur on and, like, waterproof pants. And I got me paper round bag and I went downstairs to get out and tried to open the door and it was locked. So she'd locked it so I couldn't go out. So I'm searching around the house looking for the keys. She must have heard them somewhere. I thought, oh, God, you know, I've got the papers to do. So I thought, how can I get out? So I went upstairs, climbed out of the bathroom window. God. Right. And to try and jump out the bed. Bathroom window onto the porch. But the problem was I had so much gear, I was like the Michelin Man. So I could hardly. I could hardly move as it is. Yeah. And I'm trying to get out the window and I. I'm, like trying to stretch down like that, get me foot on the. On the porch. And my bag got caught on, like, the hook of. Do you know, like, how you have a hook so you can put the window open? Right. Yeah. A little arm goes on your bag. I got caught on that. I was holding on to the. Like the. The wall and my foot on the thing so I couldn't sort of pull it. Pull it away in case I pulled it away and then fell on my head. Yeah. So I'm stuck there. Dangling. Dangling. My dad comes back from working nights. Yeah. He thinks I'm a burglar. Gets out his gun. So he's shouting and stuff, going mad and going, dad, it's me. And he had to give us a hand using. He's heard that wily trick in Manchester before. He had to help me using a washing prop thing, a big stick. What did he do? Well, he said, just hold on for your dear life and I'll sort of push the paper bag off the hook. Why didn't you go upstairs and sort out. It was at that point where I was in the middle. There was nothing you could do. Do you know what I mean? It's at that point where you've just got to make a decision. Yeah. And by the time you go upstairs, who knows what might have happened? You've got to act there and then. Messing around. Yeah. So. And you could hear downstairs now, here he is, the Pink Panther, dad. Ever so pink. Oh, so that was close to death. Because I must have been about 30 foot in the air. Yeah. And I would have, you know, that would have been nasty if I fell. Fell to the concrete painting, so. Well, there's more to come. Should we play a record and come back to this? Because he's got more. Oh, yeah. No, there must be one of them where you did fall on your head. This is the one I'm waiting for. There's got to be one. That was explained so much. Yeah, I nearly did. Nearly broke me back. Jeez. Once my dad said, I bet I can't. Kick me out. And I said, I bet I can. And I don't remember this. You didn't tell me this one. No, but it can't. What? Yeah, I was in the garden, summer's day, and it was that era when like doing kung fu and all that was really popular. Sure. And I was like messing about in the garden, punching the tree and stuff. And my dad said a lot of. Kid he must have been. My dad said, I bet you can't kick your height. Kick your height? What you mean kick as high as yourself? Yeah. So I must have been like 5 foot or something then. And I said, of course I can, so bet you can't. But instead of doing on the grass, I did it on like the. The concrete bit. Kicked it actually did it. I went, there you go. But then like get me foot down quick enough and oh, you paused to. Force to say, there, I've done it. Yeah, as opposed to putting your foot back on the ground and landed on. My back and I. I'd still get back trouble now, do you? Because they say that, don't they? So it's cut a long story short. He gave me about four or five, near to the experiences. And he went. And the whole point of this, he went, so that's why I think I'm gonna die of something horrible like cancer. And I went, why? He went, right, you ready for this? Yeah. He said, well, I don't check my balls. Wait. He said, I don't like the feel. Carl, Carl, always check your balls. Why don't you like the feel of your own balls? They just. I mean, you know that I don't like bodies anyway. Right. Do you know what I mean? It worries me a bit that you've got all that going on in your body. Right. And your skin's keeping it all in place. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. We're going down a whole other avenue of discussion. Let's play a track. Let's come back to it. Oh, right. I've brought in this. This is free, you know. You'll know from the jeans commercial. Yeah. All Right now. All right, now. Yeah, but this is a great little track. This is my brother Jake. My brother Jake. Week, Stereophonics, Vegas, two times, XFM 104.9 into the last hour. Yeah. And then three shows to go. That's true. Until we're off the air, I'm Ricky Gervais with him. Steve Merchant. Carl. All right. Yeah. Let's go and tell you. You. We. We cut short last week, weren't we? You had a. You had an amazing story about Neil Armstrong, didn't you? Well, we've been doing quotes and we like famous quotes. I've, you know, gone down in history. Yeah. And I was saying, you know, quotes don't really matter. It's more the situation that you're in than. Than the quote itself. So like Neil Armstrong, if he'd have said, what, you know, tie bacon around. Your head, I'm as happy as a pig in dust, that would have still. Gone down in history as, like, being the thing that Neil Armstrong said, wouldn't it? Yeah, yeah. But space is driven in mental. Probably, but he chose to say something profound and meaningful to befit the situation. It's. Well, he got it wrong, actually. It's a small, small step for man. One jointly for mankind. But he was meant to say, did. We discuss this last week? Yeah. Stop showing off. Well, no, but people might have been listening last week. Yeah. It doesn't matter. I can't imagine. We better tell him every week, then. Yeah. But he said. He should have said, this is one that's all set for a man. Yeah. Anyway, he had a good effort and that's quite. And that's. That's an example of what I'm saying, the fact that he got it wrong, but it still went down in history. Right. But anyway, the bit that. And it didn't happen anyway, did it? What do you mean, it didn't happen anyway? That's what a lot of people say, that no one's actually been on the moon. Ah, yes, of course, they've. They filmed it in Teddington Studios. They were saying something about there was shadow on the film, and you won't get shadow on the film. And there's all sorts of things. These people that you always quote as they. Who are they? Are they living in jars? Are they little fellas in jars? You know, do they appear to you in dreams? I've spoke to different people about it and there's loads of little things that, if you watch that program there that you know of. Of them being on the moon, there is no Way they could have done it. Right, done that's. Put to bed. Yeah. But anyway, as he was getting back in the spaceship on the moon, or whether it be a TV studio. Yeah. He said, Good luck, Mr. Croucher. Right. Have you heard this? No. And the reason he said that was because when he was a young kid and he was. I think it was Croucher, but when he was playing as a young kid in his garden, he was playing baseball with his mate and he chucked the ball to his mate and his mate hit the ball and the ball went over the fence to the next door neighbour, right? So he goes, right, I'll just nip over and get the ball. And as he was getting the ball, the window was open to his neighbor's house and he heard, like the woman shouting at her husband, saying, I'm not going to be giving you a bit rude, so if you've got a kid in the car or whatever, turn it down. What? Yeah, that's covered, that. Yeah. Right. Genius. I'm not, I'm not. No matter how many times you ask me, I'm not going to be giving you oral sex the day I do. That man would have walked on the moon. Right? Yeah. He grows up, he gets on the moon and he remembers all that story. And as he gets back in the spaceship, he says, good luck, Mr. Croucher. Now do you know. Now we'll have to say, I've heard that story before, but when I heard it, the woman said, the day I give you a blowjob is the day the boy next door walks on the moon. Which makes it all the more profane, impossible, Enjoyable. Yeah. And unlikely. Yeah. But, yeah, no, I've heard. I've heard the same story, Carl. Yeah. Look how pleased he is. I love that. Right, so not only have you remembered that anecdote, which may or may not be true, but of course you've also. Proven that kid in the garden's probably gonna walk on the moon and say something about giant leaps. But, yeah, you must have heard the thing, that it never actually happened. Yes, we've all heard it. We've all dismissed it as nonsense and moved on. Yeah, yeah, go on with our lives. Right, Carl, should we do White Van Man? You didn't, you didn't. You didn't prepare me for that. We better play a track and then I'll fish out the newspaper and stuff. Oh, this is a. Oh, it's a good little. Little bootleg track here from Meats and Poultry here. They've mixed a. With Outcast. Right, of course. It's great. Is it highly illegal. Is so people shouldn't rush to their tape machines now and press. Okay, so whatever you do, don't. Don't record this now. If you're recording. Hold on, don't say anything. All that bootlegs going into the name of nothing, Ms. Jackson, I think by Meats and poultry. So there you go. I do love these bootleg things because they're so pointless, but they're so enjoyable. Yeah, it's great. It's fun to do. Yeah, exactly. They're great. But not as much fun as White van car. White van car. Absolutely. Do you want to explain the premise? Well, we take some. The sun asked someone else and asked Carl. It's simple as that. The son of just taken a normal person. We flipped it. We can ask Carl the same questions about the week's news. Yeah, just basically your opinions, Carl, as ever. What do you make of. Well, obviously the big news. David Beckham's broken foot is this big concern for you. No, I mean it's sad, you know, it's sadder for him more than anyone because, you know, to like be in the World cup is like the main thing for him, innit? Yeah, but he's still a young lad and I don't think he'll give up. I reckon he'll still turn up. He'll be all right. And yeah, good luck to the lad. You know, I like David. I'm not gonna slag him off. He says that like he knows him. Like he's popping around for drinks later. Yeah. Like we tried to stitch you up, but obviously yesterday. Was it yesterday? I think maybe, maybe Thursday. The sun printed a big picture of David's foot and encouraged everyone to touch it at midday because hoping that this would somehow, if we all thought and prayed together, somehow that would help his foot heal. Do you. Do you believe in that? No. You're going down the old. Like you're a Gellerute, aren't you? Sure. And stupid. I mean it's nice effort and everything. It sort of cheers everyone up. Hold on. You believe in ghosts and warlocks and licking toads? Why is that any more stupid than all those things? It's just that it's not gonna work, is it? All right, fine. It's rubbish. Okay, okay, what about this then? There's apparently now available 1.5 million pound apartments available on an exclusive ship which sails around the world. Yeah, it's like it's huge thing and you just. Did you live on it and it's. I mean, in theory how big is it? It's. It's mental. It's like town center. Do you know, like, people said that the Titanic was the biggest ship? Was that only then they've got bigger ones now, haven't they? Yeah, a lot bigger. Oil tankers are much bigger and. Yeah, no, but actual liners. Yeah, yeah, it was. It was the biggest thing. Yeah. Because my mom told me that there was one that that was that big that it had, like, rough areas on it. Oh. Oh, God. Don't go starboard. Oh, God. No, but you know what I mean. We're thinking of moving. We're seeing the captain. We're thinking of moving to a nicer area. Oh, I've heard they're very rough in aft. Oh, God. Oh, that's. They steal your tires. A ship so big. That was rough areas. Oh, how. How big is this one that you're talking about? Well, I don't know. It doesn't give me the specifications here. But they're still huge. They're huge in theory. I mean, it's. It's that thing with them. It's obviously marketing, but they're gonna solve the overpopulation crisis where soon we'll all be just be floating around the city. But. Yeah, I can see that. Because, I mean, think about it, right? I've been talking to Ricky about it. I was hoping to buy somewhere in London, but there is no way in this world that I can afford it. Right. And you look at all the. All the wasted space, like with the Thames. All it's doing is like collecting crisp packets and stuff and Coke cans and people have to clean it up. Whereas if you think. If you've got a load of boats on there. Yeah, problem solved. Yeah. Would you live on a problem solved? What's his name? Did it, didn't he? What's that program? Is it Berger? Noah Bergerac. There was one where. Where he lived on a boat. I think it's quite. That was a shoestring. I'd give it a go anyway. No, I'd like to see you living in. In the air. Maybe in a giant hot air balloon. Yeah. All right. But now the boat thing, because it. It is going to get bad as well, isn't it? They're saying that the water's melting or whatever. The water's mountain, the ice is melting. Yeah. And there's gonna be more water and less land. So in the future, it's probably going to be the way we're going to be living in it. Have you seen that film Water World? No, I don't fancy it because that. Sort of predicts that. Yeah, well, they're saying that. The ice thing. Exactly. Yeah. But at the same time, I was thinking about this a couple of weeks ago. If you get. I mean, I think I read that like a big chunk of ice fell off one of the ice. What do you call them, caps, ice caps, something like that. I think they said it's the size of the Empire State Building or something. It snapped off and went into the water and it's melted. And they said, oh, it's bad news, you know, that something that size is melting. But the way I look at it, if something that size falls into the water, it's like a big ice cube and it's gonna freeze it up again. You hear me? Not really. Go on. Right. You get a giant ice cube the size of the Empire State Building, stick it in the water, it's gonna make that. It's gonna stick back on again, isn't it? Well, no, only if it freezes up again. Yeah, it will freeze up. It won't get cold again because you've just put a giant ice cube in the water. So when you put. When you put an ice cube in a drink, the drink doesn't freeze, does it? No, the ice. Not if you put one the size of an Empire State Building in your glass of Jack Daniels, it's gonna make it freezing. It's not going in a glass of Jack Daniels. It's going in the ocean. I know, but you see that? I'm using me Fables. Imagine the world. I use your brain in the world instead. Imagine the world. Imagine the sea at the Arctic or whatever as a glass of Jack Daniels. Okay. A big ice cube falls into it. Yeah. It freezes. It melts back on again. So it's. We're all right. I don't know why everyone's worrying. Thank God for that. I was getting panicked. Oh, fine. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah. No, you're right. Yeah, that will happen. Should we play some more music and then come back to my dynamite? The shining there on XFM 104.9. We're doing white van. Carl, got another one there. Well, it just another. Your thoughts really on the Queen? Mum's very British send off that she was given this week. Yeah. What do you make of all those people queuing up to see her? Did you think that was incredible? Right. Well, we said last week, you know, there was a. I don't quite understand why there's so many people there who were like getting really Upset do you know, I mean, really upset. Crying and stuff. And, you know, you can lose someone who's, like, related to you and you don't. You don't cry like that. You sort of sit there and you think back to what you did with them and stuff and. And then that's it. But the Q thing, it was one. It like miles long and stuff. Yeah, it was. Yeah. Right. I was sat watching this. We see 12 hours, Kieran. Yeah, it never got to 12 hours. It did, but that was the estimated time. Now, how long is a queue when they're just like, you know, walking along? Think how far you can sort of like, you know, stagger in 12 hours. Incredible. It was ridiculous. Yeah. But again, you know, if they want to do that, it's their time and not in it. It was at the weekend, so they could have. It's not as if they got out of work to do it. I mean, they use their own time, so good on them. But I thought, right, what they could have done. Remember when I studied Che Guevara? Yeah. Right. And don't be offended by this. It's just an idea. Because they did it with Che Guevara. Remember when they caught him up? Yes, they cut him up. What was the reason for cutting him up? Well, they cut up Che in order to try. And you. You told us that they were going to send bits of his body to Fidel Castro and various other people. Wasn't that right, as a warning? Wasn't it, though, to do all the people, like one to. Yeah. My understanding was that they cut him up in order to. So they could bury him in different places so that there'd be one. No shrine. There'd be not one place that you could go to in order to make him into a monitor. A little bit like that. I've, like. I can see where this is going. Six cues and it's like, number one, you can, you know, go and pay respect to her head or whatever. Oh, God. No, but think. I just was thinking the way of speeding it up. I'm not having a girl, not because they haven't done it, so it doesn't matter. But they did it with Che Guevara. Yeah. Everybody would have felt like they've got close to her and it would have speeded it up. No, I mean, I can understand. Could I just say that, genuinely, Carl is not being disrespectful here. This is his best idea to. To cut down the cues. So don't phone in. He's not suggesting we should have done this. He genuinely is. It's. Well, but I mean, he's not doing it to be nasty or wacky or. Or, you know, he thinks this is a good idea. So can I just throw a thought? Guevara, who was like a powerful man who did a lot for the world and what? Yeah, yeah. And I feel slightly responsible for this because have you heard of the quote, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing? Yeah. Okay, Steve, next one. No, very quick question. I can understand those that have queued for 12 hours to see the head. I'd be a little bit annoyed if I got there to find a toe. I'll tell you what, though. I'll tell you what they could do without chopping her up. They could put about nine cues each could see each hip she had. That's true enough because she's. She's had about nine of them. Yeah. So it'd just be. If you want to see the whole body, it's 12 hour cue. If you just want to see a couple of the hips. Here's another suggestion for you. I just thought, right, instead of everyone queuing to see her, why not put her on a trolley and wheeler past everyone else running? Yeah. You could have. You could have some students on Rag week that combine it, but when they're always pushing a bed, you know, they could just run it along the queue. No, that'd be fantastic. That'd be disrespectful. Right. As opposed to the chopping up. So. Sure. But just. Just an idea. Just. I apologize. Now. Anyone's offended. Anyone offended? I'm sorry. Okay. Finally, this is more frothy. Liz Hurley lying low, apparently at Elton John's house to try and avoid the press now that she's had a child. That's a good place to go to avoid the press. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Out in John's out, everyone seems to. Be friends with Elton John. Pop into Elton John's house. What is he running? Some sort. But it was like when Robbie Williams was a drunkard and a drug addict. He went to Elton John's. Yeah. And there's another fellow that went there as well. What? Someone had to, you know, to recuperate and shoulder the crown. Is he giving out false passports? I don't know if people have seen his history. He's not the man of, you know, I mean, I know he's cleaned himself up now, but, you know, and maybe that's it. Maybe he's got this kind of insight into how to deal with celebrity. Yeah. I think it's just genuine mates with Him I think he's such an offending. She's been doing too much lying low in the first place that's part of the problem, isn't it? That was a genuine joke from Carl there and he's so proud of himself. Look at his little face Too much lying low. Oh, that was my van. Why, why can't she just go around to her mum and dads or something rather than Elton John where everyone's looking? Yeah, yeah, yeah that's the point is it? Yeah so that was good yeah, very. Good yeah Right what music we got? We got a Flaming Lip Flaming licks Excellent. There's the classic Race for the Prize should have been big it never was sadly, sadly the Flaming Lips and Race for the Prize Just playing that Rick for everyone who emails the thing we get a lot of emails every week but obviously don't really respond to them because we're very lazy people but we obviously appreciate it and I play that particularly for Claire who's emailed in saying her friend Sarah Prosser would like some Beatles we're not gonna play the Beatles this week but Sarah apparently loves us more than words can express More than. Carl could express Absolutely. I'm gonna stop you there Spread Your Love on XFM 104.9 I'm Ricky Gervais with me Steve Mitchell and now it's Carl's bit. It's Carl's. It's the re Education of Carl he's like Liza Doolittle and now he's He's Coming Or Lawnmower man if you've seen that film More like Law Merman if you've seen the film you'll know what I mean and his homework was to just study quotes really on happiness and stuff and general well being he's not a big happiness quote fan eyes Carl. Not really so what have you done? You do come up with something right? Yeah I told you Right. Because a lot of these are just things you say every day they're nothing special so what I'm doing, you say them every day the sort of things you come out with and you don't even think about it, you know what I mean? Yeah they're on the TV all the time people on the radio are saying these sort of little quotes sure. And what I've done is. Remember that program on Channel 4 Faking it? Yeah where they got some like posh kid to be on a door and all that what I've done, I've imagine. If that was the pitch for the Show Dear Channel 4 just gonna get a poscid on the door. Or summer. Yeah, yeah, yeah. TV producer. Yeah, yeah, go on. So what I've done this little book of quotes, happiness quotes. I've. I've picked two that are real, okay? And I've made one up, all right? And we've got a guess. And you've got a guess. Okay, then. Well, I'll tell you what, Rick. Why don't we. When we've heard them, we won't confer. Now write down yours. Yeah. A, B or C. And I'll write down mine and we'll see how. Okay, Carl, off you go. Right. And just because I'm looking at this book, it doesn't mean I'm actually reading. No, I. Don't worry. We're clever. No, no, we know, we know. We can't see. Yeah. Can I call my bluff? Yeah, go on in. Nothing is worth more than this day. Okay. Yeah, all right. Yeah, the way I see it. Oh. Oh, God, my head's gonna burst. No, hang on. My head's gonna burst. No, no, this might not be Carl's. It might not be. How do you know? I haven't tweaked them a little bit. Yeah, good point, good point now. Good point. The way I see it, if you want the rainbow, you gotta put with the rain. Yeah, okay. All right, all right. Yeah, okay. No. Come on. Cat food. Cat food. Go on. It stinks a bit, but if you don't put up with the smell, the little kitten will die. Steve. Steve, I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. Why is this even faking it? Imagine their faces when he says that. And they're going, oh, my God. Oh, Carl, play a song, mate. We'll have to confer on this one. Well, that. That's just amazing, Carl. Just read them again. Two. Two were real, one was fake. Go on in. Right, first one. Nothing. Nothing is worth more than this day. Excellent. Next one. What does that mean? Well, cherish, cherish. Now cherish your time, okay? Because you. You can't get it back. And, you know, that's where I saw it. Carpe die and whatever it is. Seize the day and all that. Okay. If you want the rainbow, you've got to put with the rain. Yeah, of course, yeah. Rough with the smooth. You know, it's not all plain sailing, but, you know, rainbow's beautiful, but it comes because of the rain, which you might not like. So, yeah, make the most of everything. And, yeah, good cat food doesn't smell good, but if you don't put up with it, then the little kitten will die. Right. Now, Carl, that is a good effort. Now, that one's yours. I mean, obviously. Right, right. No, no, but it's a good effort, right? I mean, it slipped seamlessly into the others. Yeah. Don't think it didn't. No, but it's this good. I mean, we knew it. We knew it was that one. But what I will say is it's good. But what you don't know, maybe subconsciously is. I mean, it. It. It's very similar to the Putting up with a rain and the rainbow, but that's. Why do you think that? Wow. What. What does mine mean? Well, even though it smells bad, it's good for something, right? So I didn't look at it like that. What do you look at? I. I kind of thought. Was yours more specifically about cat food generally, because, you know, normally they like. It's an analogy. Yeah. Or a metaphor for something, you know. Well, no, the way. I mean, Dolly Parton, who I think did the rainbow rain thing, she wasn't specifically concerned about weather conditions. No, it was a sort of general idea. Well, that's. That's what I've done. Go on. I've used an everyday thing. Yeah. And put it with today's problems. Right. So like my girlfriend, yeah. She might like to go shopping for clothes. I hate it, right. But because. Because I love her, I put up with it. Ah, that's nice. Yeah, yeah. So you love that little curtain. You can't stand the smell of the stuff. You gotta feed it. But because you love it, you go, well, you know, I'll put up with this just for a few minutes and then I can, like, squeeze its head later and give it a little. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Can we go back? You know, stroke its head and stuff? All right, yeah. Sorry. It was a bit of a slip. Was it? Squeeze its little head. Yeah, yeah. That's just the thing that I do. Put it in a bag and drown it in a lake. I can feed it and then I. Can throw it against the wall. So you didn't see it like that, did you? No. That's very good. So it's about love, is it? It's about putting up with things for something you love. Yeah. Well, that's nice. But, Carl, you seem now to be convinced and rather smug that you've tricked us and that you fooled us and that we didn't understand it, but I say that's your fault, not ours. No, it's not, though. I mean, look, that man in Forrest Gump. He was a bit of a nutter. A bit of a nutter. And he came up with the life as a box of chocolates thing. Yeah. Now, if that was in this book, you say, oh, yeah, brilliant. You know, good bit of work. But if he was sat here doing the show with you. Yeah. You'd be taking the mickey out of him. Sometimes I feel he is. No, but Carl. In fact, if people are out there, we're too lazy. Could you write down everything Carl's ever said? Because I think we could publish that. Yeah. He said one today. He saw my salamander. It's not euphemism. He saw my salamander and it's just sitting there in the town. Your exotic pet. Yeah. And he's worried about. There's not been lid on. And he said. I went, what are we worried about? He said. He said. Well, he said it sits there for 24 hours a day, obviously planning to get out. Well, he's got nothing else on its mind. And the daft thing is he has actually got the. Like the lid ripped up a little bit, like it's got nothing else to think about. And I'll be looking up there. Yeah, it's gonna get out. But what's the worst that could happen? What's it thinking? What do you think it's thinking? This salamander, it's got its eye on the DVD player. I can have Ian be down the market. Oh, God. Are they dangerous? Can I just say something? Are they dangerous? I think the salamander's thinking exactly the same things as you. I mean, to look at, you've got the same expression on your face. You know what I mean? You're dressed in green as well. You've got a little round sort of Hamburglar type head like the salamander. Very similar. And yet you, you know, you, I think, and you bonded with it, didn't you? Yeah, but I. I probably would have tried to get out, but my little paper round bag would just anger. Yeah. Listen, can we have more nepotism on the show? I know that we did that earlier with the. We have my housemate, remember I was working out with him last week. To Helen from Big Brother's Dancer size video. That's just frightening. Yeah, we. We've. We've kind of let that slip a little bit, I've got to be honest. But anyway, he's joined this band. They're called Fujiya and Miyaji. Slightly difficult to pronounce, but anyway, this is a track that I Think's been getting some play by Nick Luscomb and John Kennedy on xfm. They got a gig this week at the Pool on Curtain Road. That's 18th of April, Thursday. Let's play it. I've got a fridge freezer for sale. 400 quid or nearest offer. Fujiya and Miyagi performing live, Thursday 18 April at the pool on Curtin Road. Admission is free. Rick. So I imagine you'll be heading down there. Yeah, I will. Well, I've enjoyed this show. Yeah, it's been a good one. It's great. It's been great. Carl anymore. I'll tell that story that you were telling me about your dad when he was driving. It's just that you were talking about. Well, I mentioned Forrest Gump. Yeah. And the Forrest Gump types. When my dad was a. When he was a taxi driver. Yeah. You used to have to sort of do you do your bit for the local area. Oh, God. By taking the forest people to Blackpool. Yeah. Is that what they're called now, the Forest Gump people? Is that what the. The organizations that support them are? Minibus Life is a box of chocolate types? It must be. So you work with these people? Yeah, yeah. The people with learning difficulties. Yeah. And they used to get 5 coming home. Must have been a busman's holiday. So he got five of them in the. In the cab and he had to go to Blackpool. And four of them were really good, you know, behaving themselves, didn't mess about, weren't fighting and stuff. But there was one who was just causing loads of trouble and he couldn't control him. And what you've got to be able to do with people like that, you don't want them to get stressed out because it's not good for them. It stresses them out and you could end up with a bit. Thanks, Dr. Carl. You could end up with a bit of a riot on your hands. So he thought, I'll nip this one in the bud right now. And he pulled up just on the outskirts of Blackpool and he took the one out that was causing problems and put it in a wheelie bin. I'm sorry, I apologize. He did what? Oh, he did it for the good of the others. It was having a good time. It thought it was one of the rides. Can you stop saying it? Him? Yeah, he, you know, he was having a good time and. And he. Once he calmed down, my dad went back and picked him up and he was fine. He had a good time. He left him in there the whole Time the others were in Blackpool. No, he left him there. Not. Not the whole day, probably about an hour and a half. In a wheelie bin. In a wheelie bin. Why couldn't he get out? Because, like, his arms were trapped on the thing. No. Do you know, like, when. Because he was a big fella and, like, he managed to get him in, so his arms were down the side like that. So it was. He was a bit trapped, wasn't he? Screaming and crying and stuff. He was making a bit of noise, but do you know what I mean. What you feel served him right. But anyway, that's. I didn't really want to talk about it. He just brought it up because of Forrest Gump. Do his family know about this? Is this the first time they'd have heard about this? He didn't get asked to do it again. He had another problem similar to it, where he had a little minibus and it was his job to take a load of old women to the bingo hole and it was miles away and he took him there. There was no problem. About. About 10 old women in a. In a minibus. One of them was causing trouble. So he pulled over. No. Right. So everything's fine. He dropped him off. Right. They had a lovely night. Won a bit of cash coming back. It's a bit of a late night. And they all started moaning at him, going, I want to be dropped off here, Take me there. I want to be dropped off first. I've got to get up early, blah, blah, you know, my husband's expecting me. I'm already late. Take me here first, take me there. And he just pulled up in the middle of nowhere to get out and he made him get out. And they all called for taxis. They charged that company who was meant to be taking a moment in the minibus and he got the sack. So it's a similar sort of story. You can't be dealing with it when people don't sort of just calm down and, like, solve the situation. Yeah. They're just all like, I want to be dropped off first. Take me here first. Yeah. So he acts like a madman. We've got a crack on, haven't we, really? We got so much. Yeah. Yes. Nick Drake, A song for the ladies this week from the album Brighter later at the time of a city clock.
