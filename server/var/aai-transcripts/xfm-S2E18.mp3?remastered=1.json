  "text": "That was the Christmas song, remember? And dissing all over the place, as usual. Absolutely. Dissing all his mum and everyone. It's a little bit cussing in there, which they leaped out. Thankfully, Carl's in a bad mood already. He's been in about three minutes and he's in a bad mood. Getting stressed. If you can't hack it, leave. What's the matter with you? No, I'm just saying it's been. I was meant to enjoy last Saturday off and I didn't. Why not? Why is that our fault? Because you weren't here. Just because. I don't know, but are you not. In the Christmas spirit? Why didn't you enjoy last Saturday? What did you do? I went, right, I went all the way back up north again, right, because it was Suzanne's dad's birthday, right? I was busy last week. Didn't have time to get him a present or anything. Didn't have time to get him. So I got to Houston station, bought a card for him, which was a Christmas card. So he wasn't happy because he was saying, it's my birthday, and I said, well, I won't be seeing you again, so I've got a joint card. And then we went out. Did you get him a present? Well, no, because we went out on Saturday night for something to eat at this pub that he likes. It's a nice steak and onion rings, right? So he should be happy anyway. Yeah, but what, you paid for it? No, no, but he should have been happy. Suzanne paid for that because it is her dad, right, not mine. So I said, all right, what. What can I do? I said to her. So she said, just buy a few drinks or something. Anyway, I didn't get around to getting drinks. I can't believe it. Right? So I said, right, I'll pay for the cab, right. Oh, what a lovely Christmas gift that is. Yeah. Two pound fifty. I paid. No, it's like three quid back. So six quid you spent on him? Well, no, I spent more. See, that's what he said. You get the bolt on them back. He said, oh, you spent on me six quid for me birthday. He said, no, I haven't, because I gave the taxi driver. I'm a little bit worried about his attitude as well, because even if. I mean, that is a stingy present, but you don't go. You don't say. I mean, let's be honest, that's the worst Christmas gift ever, because, I mean, you're pretty bad, like we've discussed in the past. But at least you spend a bit of money. Yeah, it's just thoughtless. Yeah. This is nothing. I'm giving him any time. I mean, I would and I knew. And I knew my. My demographic, they loved it. My family, they couldn't believe their luck, you know? Well, a tenner. You spent a tenner on him? Well, the cafe was six. But the thing is, he doesn't. It's not. I don't think he's saying that. I think it's the fact that this is like, you know, fritting away. He would have loved. I'm sure he would have been appreciative of a lovely 10 pound gift that you cared about and bought. But he probably likes fly fishing, doesn't he? By J.R. hartley if you'd have bought that either Gun. That's what I was looking for. Or e. What I was looking for. Car. Hey. Bloody hell, Carl, you little balls twat. That's just what I wanted. So. All right. So just calm down. So what have you got planned for. For Christmas? Is this what I mean, have you. Are you spent. Are you doing this? Excellent. You've paid me milk bill for this. Week that were re. Nice. I'm spent this year. So have you planned anything for Suzanne or are you just. Yeah, I'm taking her out Christmas Day for something to eat. Well, don't. Does she know that. Is that. Was that. She's working today, so she did issue. You know. Right, okay. So what Christmas gift have you got? That's it. I'm taking her out. What you haven't got. You haven't got a present. No, because we spent a lot. Don't forget, that's half yours, though. You're gonna be. You're not gonna just be sitting there watching her eat, going, oh, I'm hungry, but I spent all her. You're gonna be eating as well. That's half yours. So you've got. She's got like a cat who's here. She's got nothing to unwrap. There's nothing. She's gonna hand something over to you because I've met the woman. She will. She'll hand something over. You'll open it. You'll love it. I might get something today. You shouldn't take me to begrudgingly persuade you to do it. God, yeah. Well, we're gonna. I'm gonna try and stick in some Christmas songs. We're not playing all Christmas songs, but I brought in a couple. So. This is Christmas. John Lennon, the River. Joni Mitchell, Fairytown, N.Y. one of the best Christmas songs ever. Oh, what about a bit of Pretenders? That's a good one. 2,000 miles pretenders. 2,000 miles on XFM 104.9. This sort of Christmas edition. We're not here next week, are we? No. Carly's. Aren't you? Well, you are in a way. I was doing the best of it. Is it the best of. Yeah, brilliant. Have you been putting together? Not yet. Okay, I'll do it today. Tell me what bits you want in it and I'll sort it out. It's not for me. Yeah, it is the best stuff. Well, maybe people could email in with their. Their. The highlights of the year for them. I'm trying to think what they were. I mean, mostly it'd be mostly Carl, wouldn't it? Mostly Carl. Gibberish from Carl. I think it'd be an awful lot of Educating Ricky from Carl. Well, ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk if you've got any thoughts on stuff you'd like to hear again. Is there anything you'd like to hear of Carl saying something stupid? Me and Steve laughing or slapping him? Yeah, that's basically the competition, isn't it? Well, there's a couple of instances where I tried to kiss him, I think, and you encouraged me. Yeah, those are some highlights for me. I wish I had a video that. Yeah, so do I. You mentioned Educating Ricky. We've only got, you know, we normally have like three installments. Yeah. Only got two today. Just. Well, you clearly weren't busy Christmas shopping. So what are you? What's the next. Yeah, yeah. Well, like I say, every week it's a bit of a struggle finding stuff that I can teach you, sport. But at the same time, what we have got, we've started the feature A teased MTV with it. Right. So I thought I'd best start doing it before they get someone like Zane Lowe presenting it or something. Yeah. So do we need them? Do we need them? And you should explain, do we need them for those that. That don't like the show? Well, it's sort of education about animals and stuff and if we need them. So like David Attenborough once said, you can get rid of people off the earth and it would carry on, there's no problems, but, you know, get rid of a monkey and you could have problems on your hands. So is that a direct quote from Attenborough's current author? I think so, yeah. So what I've done today, right, it. All starts over there with. Right, so then. Yeah, exactly so. And he always ends Things you got yourself all. Quite all sorts of problems. Yeah, yeah. So that's. That. That's done. That's. That's coming up. Enjoy that. Enjoy that. I've spoke to a woman about jellyfish. Oh, yeah. Because I know you're not a fan. Not a fan of them. So we'll be speaking women or jellyfish. This is a woman. Yeah. So we'll be sorting that out before 3:00. We'll be finding out if we need them. He's great and he's great. And then we've got a Christmas edition of Rockbusters. I found out yester. Go on. Channel 4 have ripped it off. Go on. It's on their teletext thing. That's outrageous. Yeah, on their teletext page. Someone said. What are they doing then? Like Rockbusters. They're copying the former. You sure they're not copying blockbusters? No, no, it's. It's. Someone said it's a cryptic clue of a band and that and initials and you work it out. That is despicable. I mean, right, investigate this. So they've. They've fundamentally ripped off the idea of being allowed to do a cryptic clue to get a band. Yeah, but the sort of clever, cryptic clues. Hey, I should just point out, because it's Christmas time, we've had an email from Dickie Anderson. Yeah, R.A. is. Well, he's. I suppose he's a long time listener. Yeah. And he emails us most. Most weeks. Ricky, if, as I suspect I'm your only listener, I wouldn't bother with your show today as I've got to attend some family Christmas nonsense at Auntie Marion's house. And he's good because considering he hates the show and everything we stand for. He does. He does take the time to email every week. That counts and that count to advertisers. Yeah, I think we've got a lot like him. We've also had a lovely Christmas card here from Alexandra. Right. Who's wish us L. She loves the show. She loves you, Carl. And she's enclosed some biscuits. Biscuits for you to save you a bit of money because she knows. She goes out and get you your own biscuits. Then we've got some lovely little packet of. Why don't you wrap them up and you can give them to your girlfriend. Don and Blitzen from the About Boy soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy Christmas theme there. Christmas theme there. He spotted the Christmas theme. Yeah. Carl's not really in a festive mood. But I can't imagine Christmas is your time of Year, is it, Carl? Well, I'm not sure any time of the year is really. I like to. When I was about. I think when I was about seven, I enjoyed it. Was that the one? Was that the year? The big year? Loads of stuff. You don't have to worry about anyone else, but once you've, like, got a job. What'd you get when you. When were you doing your paper? Around. How old were you then? I was about 13, 40. That was you then? Your own man? Yeah, I had to buy stuff. Oh, but you still. I didn't realize this. No, no, it's just that. And that's coming from him, Carl. My dad always said, oh, it's Teddy on. That's her. Christmas morning was for, like, you know, for me. So he used to stay in bed, so, you know, he never. That's brilliant. That's a great thing, saying it. Yeah, yeah. Christmas mornings for you, run wild, do what you want, just don't follow me. I'm going to Honolulu for two weeks. That's great. Dad, it's Christmas. Do I have to do anything? No. So my mum used to get up because she used to like to see me face light up, you know, when I opened my presents and then fireworks and then to go to my bedroom from about 6 o'clock onwards because, like, my mum, dad were into having big Christmas parties and I wasn't, like, old enough to go, right. So they say, right, you know, you've had your fun there. You go up to your bedroom, staying there. Yeah, I remember one year, right, I got. Got a train set. That's what I wanted. Yeah, right, Brilliant. Playing with it all day, I thought, I don't mind about the party. I'm happy staying up here playing with this. Brother comes in, he's had a few, right. He's going, yeah, I'll give us a go on your day. He's. He's a bit older than me, so he. He might have been like, let's see. Well, let me let him be 18. Yeah, probably about 18. 19 I was. Well, I had a train set, so I don't know, about 14, something like that, right, so. So I'm playing on that, loving it and stuff and then he comes in and goes, oh, gives a go. He turns the transformer up to like 14. He went really fast for about five seconds, broke it and then he went back downstairs. Wow. So Christmas ironing got. Sounds like the Conservative government with British Rail. Satire. I just saw that. There's satire, there's any satirical shows. This way it doesn't work in any way because it's. There's the analogy falls down. Apart from there being a train. Think it through, though. British Railways trains. Yeah. And the government broke the trains in many ways. They didn't break them, like, not officially breaking them, but they. It does work. It's perfect. Oh, I'm pretty pleased with that. And I can't. And no one's asked him to be on. Have I gotten this for you? It's weird, isn't it? Because it's strange that you've got a. Satirical mind that that's as quick as that. Yeah. And he's broke your little train set. So what did you do? I just, like, watched telly and had some sausages. I bet you were happy with that though, weren't you? Bit annoying though, isn't it, when your main present of the year is been broke. Did it ever get it fixed? No, that was it. That was it. Put away. I'm intrigued why your parents wouldn't let you come and join in the festive fun. Was it like, we need the bor down there. Was it like eggnog everywhere? Well, no, but, I mean, it's fair enough. Six is a little bit early, but I just think, you know, if you're your kid, you know, he had those fun. Put him to bed. Put him to bed at 8 maybe. And he saw on Christmas Day. I thought that was a day for family. Well, not if there's a party going on. Well, don't have the party on Christmas Day. Well, that's, That's. That's another option. Yeah. Your parents are weird. Are they a strange breed? Well, I think that was a year, right? I. You're talking about buying presents and stuff. I think I did treat me man. So I didn't buy my dad anything. I think that was like, when I got a bit older, I used to get me dad something because he wasn't that bothered. Anyway, so got me mum. It was a cheap shop, right? Of course. Thank God for that. Called snips. So I went in there and I thought, let's see what I can get her. And remember Victoria Plummet. I don't think so. Well, it's like a fairy character, right? I mean, Mum's into gnomes and stuff, right? So I thought, right, she must be. Pleased with you then. Victoria Plum. I was thinking, is that one of the neighbors? Is it. Is it like a brandy or. Victoria Plum. Victoria Plum. Victoria Plum, Yeah. It's like a little fictional sort of character. Okay, okay, so. So I saw it. I thought yeah, she'll love that, right? So I did me paper round, saved up for two weeks, right? Got that sorted, went to snips, bought the Victoria Plum next day. I mean, I'm in town with her, right? So I think, oh, I know what I'll do. I said, come, come in here a minute, right? So we go in and we're looking around and I tested her, right? I went, look at that there. That's all right, isn't it? And she goes, oh, it's bloody awful. Oh, Carl. Oh, Carl. I just, I, I. Oh, God. So then Christmas Day comes. I said, don't bother opening it. She said, no, no. Why? Oh, no? Why don't you still give it to her? So. Well, it's too late. I'd already bought it. Oh, cool. So she opened it and I was like. And she said, oh, that's nice. I said, why are you saying that? I said the other day. He said, it's bloody awful. She said, oh, no, I thought you were pointing at something else. Oh, no. So that's why I don't get anyone anything anymore. Oh, God. Playing record oh, God. Oh. Oh, no, that's good, isn't it? My bad. Gold Rush let you down. I'm actually quite affected by Carl's Victoria Plum scenario. Just the fact that. That eagerness. He wants to make sure it's a great present. He saved up his paper round. He thinks it's like a gnome, but modern. I'm worried that you're using it as an excuse now and that's why you're not buying anyone any gifts, because you've had your fingers burned once. I mean, you were six, seven years old, to be fair. No, you weren't. You're about 13, weren't you? If you're doing your paper around? Yeah, it must have been. Yeah. 11 or 12, then. All right, yeah. So I'd saved up. I know I'm not using it as a thing, it's just. What'd you get your mum this year? I've sent them some money so they can get a passport. Are they trapped somewhere? They're in a holding bay somewhere. Somewhere in Dover. Who's a truck driver? Who's going to sneak him across? What do you mean, so they can buy a passport? What do they do, sell it when they were. No, they haven't got that much money, Right. They've never been abroad and the mate said they might attack them next year and they said, oh, we haven't got a passport, so you've got to buy. A passport, have You. Isn't that your God given right as an Englishman? No, you got to pay for them. They're 30 quid each, so you better add do, otherwise they're conning me. Right. You don't get born with a passport. You sent them 60 quid. Well, check. Right. I love that. If you're watching Teddy France to come on. And they go, oh, what do you think of that? She goes, it looks bloody awful. Don't open it. No, don't open it. Don't open it. So you've not. You've not paid for a holiday for them. You. You've no. Just sorting out the world. It's a better prize in it because they can't go anywhere without it. Well, the passport keeps on giving. Yes. 10 years. 10 years, that is. Yeah. So. But no, I never used to. I mean, I can't think of other things. I used to get me dad once, Once I started getting him stuff. It used. So it used to be a dressing gown and then. But as an extra surprise, I used to put like a cigar in the pocket so he'd think that was it. Yeah. Then he'd put it on and put his hand in the pocket. Right. And then he hit you because he thought you'd nicked it. Yeah. Oh dear. So you bought a jacket with a cigar. That's quite thoughtful. Did you sneak a cigar once? When? Christmas. Well, it was when. That's when they used to have like the big do's. Like I say, you know, they were. They were known for it. Like the whole estate used to know that. You know, we were having a party. Yeah. So they'd all come round. So they all come round and scout food and drink and that. I can't imagine. I cannot imagine how unpleasant that must have been awful. And you locked in your bedroom with a broken train set. Yeah. And looking at Victoria plum, whatever that. Was in the bin. Oh, in the bin, yeah. And you're a mum saying. And he got me. This isn't this piece of rubbish. You could hear him just throwing it against the wall and laughing. All the neighbors laughing. And you'd come down just being pieces with loads of spit on it. Ye. And all the Polaroids of them just like laughing at it and pointing, stamping on it. All right. But no, no, I used to get up in the morning and then like they'd still, still sort of all be there asleep on the floor and on the sofa. That's terrible. Christmas is surely the one day a year which is a family thing. It's for the Kids. They're the ones. That was Boxing Day. It's over. Yeah. Back on the bike. All right. Who's gonna pay for this? What, me? Yes, Carl. You're doing two rounds today. Yeah. What's your paper room? Supporting the entire family. Yeah, so. So I used to get up and, like, go downstairs and they'd be asleep, so I'd be mooching about, trying to find, like, another present that's still working. I love the idea these people from the estate had, like, squashed his presence. Yeah. So I found a cigar that had been sort of lit up and then put out. So I thought, oh, I'll have a go at that again. That's the last time I smoked. Right. I tried it. So I don't like that. I love that. He does everything once. Yeah. And he's like, it's a line of. I've done everything once, I don't need to do it again. Oh, dear. I said in the past to you, Rick, that my grandparents. So I love them dearly, but it's like for the last 30 years, they've been waiting to die. I know. It's like they just sort of. It's like, you know, the novelty wore. Off of, like, in the 50s. Got kind of bored of it, like. Yeah. In the forties. It was brilliant. All sat around the old Joanna's. The bombs fell, singing. They love that. The 50s, you know. That was great as well, because that was the post war years. It was. No, it's a bit tight in the pocket, but it was all right. Everyone pulled together. Then the 60s came along, all the crazy music. Let's stay in bed. And they basically stayed in bed. And it was one Christmas when my grandmother said to my dad, what you like for Christmas? What do you fancy for Christmas? And this must have been, I don't know, 20 years ago. She said, what do you. What do you fancy for Christmas, Ron? And he went, well, you know, I could do with a nice big kind of warm winter overcoat. She said, don't worry about that. Don't worry about that, because your father will be dead soon. It's what you can have is meaning my granddad. Well, I feel my father's still waiting, which is good news. Good news for my grandfather. That's good news for my dad. Freezing. How is he today? He's fine. Okay. Oh, I'm freezing. It is very such a weird mindset that I think it's. That, to me, is what sums up people from that older generation, the 40s and 50s. And it seems to Me that you've got that kind of mindset. It's like you were born in the 30s. Whenever you talk of your childhood, it's like you had like a baked potato stick. The other thing is, I think that that sort of generation. It seems that the man is dependent on the woman. There's a total dependence. Oh, absolutely. If. If she dies, he's done. Yes, he's done for it. Just pine away. If he dies, she's got 30 years of pottering. Absolutely. You know what I mean? And going to like, you know, the youth club. It's sort of like that. It's. It was sad, of course it's sad for them, but it's not the end of their life. No. And it sort of is the other way around. I don't know why that is. Yeah, it's terrible. That's a little melancholy thought for. I know I've really brought. You brought it down. You've brought it down. This isn't a nice show at all. This is terrible. Just killing themselves. What? Well, I didn't really want to make it a Christmasy type show because I don't really like it. Oh, he's done it again. Well, he did Christmas once. Didn't like it. No, he's just not religious or anything. What are you? You're not anything. Teenage Fan Club from the XFM Christmas album and that's Christmas Eve. Their guitar sounds are just brilliant. They're just always so nice. All right. Carl's like that. It's like Teenage Fan Club. Yeah, yeah, they're good. I feel like you've never kind of enjoyed the wonder of Christmas. I don't think I can't ever get the sense. Maybe except when you were very, very young, you know, that kind of bright eyed, you know, thinking of Santa, you know, kind of landing on the roof and coming down the chimney, drinking the sherry or whatever. I like, I like the idea of it. Right. The. The sort of, you know, I used to like. I used to get a couple of annuals every year, you know. Yeah, yeah. And I was allowed to open one on Christmas Eve. Oh, that's brilliant. Just. Yeah. So they could throw it on the fire. Yeah, yeah. That's a light with cigar off the cooker. Oh, well, anyway, listen, I'm a good friend of ours, Ross Noble in Canadian. Brilliant. He's giving me this picture, Carl, which he's got from a magazine. He loves you. I think this. I just looked at it then obviously it's not going to mean much to the listener. Oh, this is currently Available, I think. It'S in the current edition of Bizarre magazine, so you might want to buy it. It's not horrible, though, is it? It. There's a certain grotesqueness about it. Oh, I just think it's a deformed person, isn't it? Well, to a degree. But I think what it's going to do for Carl is give him. I think, just. I think for you and I, Rick, we're going to see his face. Brighten up, Lighten up. Like opening a wonderful Christmas gift. I know what. I think I've seen this. Is this the one with the kid with the big head? I'll be honest with you, Carl, it is. Have you seen it already? Let me just show it to you again so you can kind of. I haven't seen it. It's like. We shouldn't be laughing at that. No, but that is like the kid who I went to school with. That is the same. So do you recognize him? Seriously, that. That. That is the same thing you had. I mean, I have to say, it. Does look like it's been computer generated. It's so odd. Oh, but look at the child's face. I know. Don't take another photo of me. I'm not sure this is right. It's not right. It's not right. But I just. I was hoping that that would give you, Carl, just a little glimpse of. We've had a request as well. Another. The best bits to. Someone wants to hear you talking about your mates with the big heads. Because every time we go there, I get. We get some sort of complaint about something. About what? Leave it. Well, that. For some reason, that always goes from the story with me dad going to Blackpool for taking those kids there and. What kids? Leave it. No. What? What? I don't know. There's people that know what you're talking. About when we put a song on. No, well, I know what it is, but you can't just say that. Is it. Okay, Is it when your dad put a kid in the wheelie bin because he was getting it home? Yeah. So we're gonna go through it. Too controversial. We're gonna. What's her name? The thing is, right, you were just saying about. What are you. About Christmas? That's the funny thing, right, because in our house there's no one who's religious, right? No. My dad got annoyed when I went to church that day. He's like, what you're doing that for? Of course. I went to see a gig in Liverpool. Remember the band, the Christians? Yeah. He thought I'D join some club. Yeah. I said, I've been to see the Christians. He was saying to me, man, what, what's he doing going out with them? Yeah, yeah. And then the other thing is, because I'm not christened or anything, my mum used to say to me, don't tell anyone that because there's witches and stuff. I want it. I want to go back and see something. I just want to go back and see him at 7. One day, one day in the life of Carl. Just to have three ghosts visiting tonight and take him back through time. But we could go with him. We go, well, we can be some of the ghosts. Yeah. Christmas. Remember this? That's. That's incredible. So she wasn't crystal, but she thought maybe someone could take your soul cuz you weren't christen. It's like there's, there's cults and that in there and if they find out you're not christened then. Right. I don't think they care. I don't think a lot of cults care. What can they do if you're, if, if you're not Christian? I don't know. I just said, all right, because then through that time there must have been a time when now they know. Yeah, but I'm older now, so I'm all right. She used to worry about me playing out on the street. Oh, she was worried about whether you were naive and stupid and easily led. Yeah, no, no, no, good point. No, you're right now. Yeah, yeah, good. Rock Busters. Rockbusters. We'll tell the prizes, Steve. Yeah, we have Christmas gifts. This is Christmas gifts. I don't know if you'll receive them in time to actually pass them off as gifts. I wonder if I can tell that Ross Noble story that he told us. I don't know. We'll have to discuss that when the records play. Okay. Okay. So you heard a track from it just then. It's the XFM Christmas album, I think, that's been knocking around here in the office for years, isn't it, Carl? Or is it new this year? It was brought out about two years ago, but Christmas songs are Christmas songs. Yeah, it's not bad. It's got bands on there like the Dandy Warhol's, the Web Brothers are on there, Drugstore Bell and Sebastian, Flaming Lips, all sorts. So we've got that to give away. We've also got this Smashing Pumpkins compilation which we've seen again that seems to be knocking around for weeks. Another one of those 50 years of the Greatest hit singles. I don't know. Culture clubs on their queen, obviously. Seen the cult film. Yeah, the cult film will come back to shortly. This, I think, is one of the most exciting gifts. If you have a video player and you want to get trim, then Surely Big Brother 3 champion Kate Lawler and her cardio combat video, in which I think she uses kind of, I don't know, military boxing training to get you trim and taught and looking as good as her, then you can get that as well. We've also got a exclusive 7 inch single from the White Stripes, a kind of Christmas single. Is that from there? Yeah, yeah. That must be quite rare. That's probably the only thing that is worth something. And the current Badly Drawn Boy album, have you Fed the Fish? Which I think is slightly mediocre. They've gone up, actually. I think that the level of prizes there has gone up. Not a bad selection. But here is the big movie and actually, I have to say, this is not a bad one. No, it's not. Again, it's not. Not terrible at all. It could be worse. It's James can in the original Rollable, not the disastrous remake that came out recently, but the DVD version of Rollable. So that's there as well. So something fairly interesting that's worth winning. Right, come on, then, let's do Rockbuster. Will we play a song together? Pen and paper and that's. Yeah, yeah. So we're doing it next. Yeah. Vines was Jackson on XFM 104.9. Mickey Gervais with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington, the man of the moment with his Rock Busters coming your way with all those great prizes. Yeah. Right, how are we doing it now? I noticed Heat magazine sort of put a bit of a spanner in the works. Why? Because they were saying, oh, maybe it'll be a Christmas edition of Rockbusters. And I'd already sorted them out. I wouldn't worry, Carl. Well, what I've done, I've cleverly tweaked them to make them Christmassy. So the Christmas bit in it has got nothing to do with. With it whatsoever. But I just thought. So you mean the clues have a Christmas element, but it's nothing to do with the answer. Yeah, it's nothing to do with the answer. All right, so why don't you just ask the normal ones and I'll ring a bell. I'll shake some bells in sort of speech. So the first one, there's a load of letters there asking for advice. Put them on Claire's desk. Oh, and have a good Christmas. Give it to us again. Oh, God. Right, so there's a load of letters asking for advice. Put them on Claire's desk. Owen. Have a good Christmas. Right, bear in mind, people, that the Christmas element may not be relevant. I've got nothing to do with it. I don't want to. Okay, and the initial letter is F. Right, That's F. All right. Right, the second one. Ask your mum if you should after you've wrapped the presents. Ask your man if you should. Ask your mom if you should after you've wrapped the present. That's S. And the last one, A couple of people were arguing in the supermarket at the fruit and veg counter. But it's busy in there because it's Christmas. That's B. Oh, B. Oh, God. So they're the. They're the three or just recap. Yes, please. Yeah. I have no idea. I can't even. I don't know what to start thinking. Well, right, there's a load of letters there asking for advice. Put them on Claire's desk. Have a good Christmas. Have a good Christmas. Second one. Ask your mom if you should after prison. S. And the last one, a couple of people were arguing, arguing in the supermarket at the fruit and veg counter. But it's busy in there because it's. Busy because it's Christmas. That's a B. So they're the three things. It's email only. This one, please. Remember that. Ricky Gervais fm.co.uk ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk Brilliant. They're good. Yeah, please. All right. Is there going to be more rock bushes in the new year? We're not sure. I'm not still, you know, thinking about new ideas that we can do. Okay. Are we starting Ricky Dickulous today? Have you done? Look forward to Ricky Dick? He's worried about. He nearly said asked and he just stopped because he's worried because he's a producer. Yeah, well, I've got a set of Standard. Oh, dear, Carl. You have, mate, you have. So that's that. We've still got to come. Oh, I'll tell you what, why don't we have a lovely tune, right, you make the tea, we're open these biscuits from Alexandra. We'll be enjoying that, right? Maybe Segue, so we can have a nice little, you know, rest. I don't want to talk through it. It'd be rude. And then we're coming back and as part of, like, Pilkington Parkinson and do we need them? Do we need them. Yeah. Carl has interviewed an expert on jellyfish. We've got that. Plus, of course, we've got two part. A two part Educating Ricky. You've got Educating Ricky still with a. Christmas theme or not. And we've still got things like the Pogues, John Lennon, Joni Mitchell, just David Bowie. Are you suggesting there's gonna be some. Great music and some fun chat? Lovely walk out to winter. Super grass. Seeing the light on XFM 104.9. Good. We had our little biscuits, haven't we? I think. I think I could just sum up the station, can't I, Steve, with that just last comment. You're probably right. I just came in, I just went to the toilet there, and it's a disabled toilet. It's close to it. So, you know, you go there. I had a way. I thought, oh, the thing doesn't work, didn't flash. Okay. But I said, oh, the. The toilet doesn't work, doesn't flush. And car went, no, just stick your hand down and pull that wire up. Put your hand in the water. I mean, just when. When David Bowie interviewed Zoe and. Come on. Yeah, there's toilet snow flash. He goes, all right, baby, just stick your hand. Now pop the. Down, the down the U bend and just wipe your hands on your pants. Thanks very much. I mean. Oh, Sums up this station, doesn't it? Absolutely. Tinpot. Have you ever done this? This is one of my most embarrassing moments, is. You know, because sometimes. You'll see. You'll see. Well, you'll. You'll realize what I was gonna say. What happened? Rick almost leapt to the end of the story. Right. But I realized I had to go back a few steps. I just don't. Have you ever come. It was gonna be coming, but it. But you'll understand in a minute when I finish the story. It's not coming in the traditional sense. All right. Because it also is followed by coming out of. Oh, sure. All right. Yeah. So. And not your trousers. Okay. Okay. All right. So now, awkward moment. And I should just. You know, if you're Christmas shopping, maybe you're in a big department store and you see the disabled toilet and you think yourself, I can nip in there. I can use that, you know, because it's close to hand. Because I got wander miles for the regular toilets. I went in there once again, 20 disabled toilets. Just snuck in, came out disabled person furious. That was. But it's really awkward because it's like. Because it is like it's their sort of private domain, you know? It's like. It's like they're part of an exclusive club. They've not got many perks in life and that's one of them. And here I was, you know, kind of. Kind of exploiting it, but I can't. Well, yeah, I suppose they can be annoyed, but it looks like. Did you do affect a limb, do you know? I normally do. I often do. I've affected a limp many times. Like for instance. Yeah. If I take the lift in a building when it's only one flight of stairs, right. And they know and I get up on the first floor, I always affect a limp coming out. So that justifies why I haven't come up with the stairs. Like, who is it? I'm scared is gonna sort of say something. Yeah. But it's the same thing as if someone asked me for directions. I always pretend I'm foreign. I always go, I don't. Why do you do that? Because I'm just terrified of giving them the wrong directions. Well, just now, I don't know, I don't live. I don't like because I'm sort of, you know, I feel bad because. What? I used to sort of give directions because I like giving directions, I like helping people out. But then I realized I didn't really know. You used to hang around going, you alright? Yeah, we're fine, yeah. Do you want to know where to go? I tend to have a go, even if I don't now. Exactly. But I'm always terrified they'll come back and find you and go, you led us astray. So now I just affect a foreign accent. There's a fellow the other day, about two weeks ago, when I was walking in, little old woman, little old fella come up to me and said, where's Wimpole Street? So I said, I do know it. So I think it's over there. And then I'm not very good with street names, but I'm good that if you say, oh, there's a boots on it. Right. I mean, if there's something near it, it's like the same with directions. When I used to drive a lot. Yeah. Or historical facts. I didn't. I don't know, like old motorway names. You know, I'm this and I'm that. I can never remember that. But my dad used to always say, right, there's a horse in the field, turn right and stuff like that. And it's the same with this fella. They sort of said, you know, where's, where's Wimpole Street? And I said, well, what are you after? And he said, I'm after some blood. Yeah, there's doctors around there. And they. So I was like, oh, so that didn't help me. What do you mean he was after some blood? He said, oh, I need some blood. He must have had an illness. No, he just must have needed some new blood or something. He had some illness. And I was like, you know, why. Did he go to the petrol, get some power? No, like, he didn't have fangs and a cape, did he? No, but do you know what I mean? Oh, that didn't help me out. But what if he just said, well, some pile cream, actually, can you. You go, oh, we want boots then. Yeah, it would have been all right, but I didn't know where to start with that. I need some blood over there. Yes. So I pointed him away, but. So he was. He was losing consciousness. You said in the wrong way. He's dragging himself along the pavement. Is there blood this way? The gash is growing ever deeper. Well, we've got to. We've got to do Pilkington, haven't we? Do you wanna. Yeah. Okay, we should explain this, I think. Well, this is Carl's new idea for a TV show. He wants to do a TV show called Do We Need Him? Where he goes round and he talks to experts like David. David Bellamy, maybe Lenny Henry doing David Bellamy. Right. If he can't get the real one and he just picks on an animal that he doesn't really like, don't think you need him. And an expert will tell him if we do. If this is the first installment. Let me put a song on right, now we've got them and then I can set it up and stuff and tell, you know, we can explain it fully explain it and that. Let's do a classic. Let's do a big stomp in one of the best Christmas songs of all time, shall we? What are you thinking? Fairytale in New York. Excellent. Fairytale New York, featuring Kirsten McCall on XFM 104.9, the Christmas Edition. Indeed. Next week. We've had loads of Jefferson suggestions, Carl, for your best bits. It's basically all your best bits. Me and Steve are largely irrelevant in the. In the voting. So, yeah, you can compile your best bets next week. And they'll be loving it. We had a quest for the. The little Chinese fellow in his pants. A horse in the house, Cutting your hair on the railway station. If. I mean, if you haven't heard those stories. What does that mean? The little Chinaman in Your pants. You've got to be tuning in next week to find out what that is. The only thing is the older horse in the house was in the best of. Was it? Yeah. Well, that. That doesn't stop. What's his name? If you're one of those people that want to see these clips again. Yeah. Tune in. It'll be all right. On the night 84. Yeah. Someone kill me. I think I'm gonna live forever. It's like we said before. Who goes to the recording of one. Of those people in the audience? Yeah, that'll be great. Tickets for it. We're out in the night and they. Laugh at his jokes. But, I mean, I. I don't know. I think. How many takes it. You know, I mean, how long it takes to record that? The show hours. So the recording must be about nine. Have you ever seen Kirsty's Home Videos on Sky? I think so. I think so. Dogs falling down. It's like. Yeah, it's like you've been framed. But it's falling over in a wedding. It's got audience laughter. But I'm assuming it can't be a real audience. I'm assuming it must be like they've. Just lifted it from the Flintstones. Yeah, they laughed from the Flintstones. A lot of people forget the Flintstones had an audience. If you. If you watch the Flintstones, there's laughter when Fred does something funny. Yeah. The idea of people should being shipped in. But we were talking. I like the idea that some jokes weren't as funny as others. Like the director going, we'll put a laugh on that. It's not as funny. Dino should get a round of applause every time he comes in. Everyone knows him. The kids love him. We're making it up. Yeah. Barney getting disgruntled because his jokes never get. Yeah, he's like, wise. Anyway, so here we go. This exciting feature that will, I, I think will be picked up by Channel 5. It's going to be Carl Pilkington. Do we need them? Where Car goes around checking out animals with top experts asking whether we need them in the world. Yeah. So, yeah, this is the first one. We won't do it next week, but I'm already sorting out the contact. We will be looking at octopus because they're a bit weird. Okay. So that's. That's what you've got to look forward to in two. Oh, you know, again, if you have. An animal that you feel is unnecessary in the world, then email us and I'm sure Carl will investigate for for you. Well, the other thing as well, whilst we're on to that, I want to sort of have a bit of research with me. So when I speak to the, like the bloke of the woman about the octopus, right, I want, like. You want to be responsible. Well, sort of response from listeners. So I can say, well, 70 of XFM listeners said we should get rid of them. Sure. Do you know what I mean? Like Jon Snow does on Channel four when he does all, like, politics stuff. So if you agree with me, just send an email saying, yes. So, yes, we should get rid of them. Yes. Yeah. Yes, get rid of them. Because you're. You're always. You're. The house believes always we should get rid of these animals. That's. You're picking animals you want to get rid of. So, yes, is get rid of them. No, is don't get rid of them. And not. No, it's Noah, because they go on the ark. The ones we keep going the ark. That element I've completely forgotten about. And I think that's a wise move because I don't think that's working. I don't think he thought through the whole Noah. And that's just complicating the show, I think. So, yes, yes, we get rid of them, Noah. They're saved on the ark. Right, okay, so here we go then. Jellyfish. Today we're looking at jellyfish in Pilkington. Right. I'm talking to. To Vicki, who works in the aquarium in. In Anglesey, isn't it? Yes, it is, yes. Right, brilliant. Today we want to find out if we really need jellyfish. I've got a bit of a problem with them anyway, because I've been. I've been stung by one and I've done a little bit of research into them. So I'll tell you what I know about them. Okay. You know, you might learn some stuff from me. Oh, you never know. And if I'm talking nonsense, just. Just tell me. Absolutely right. So first of all, they don't have eyes, do they? No, they don't. Right, so I'm right with that. No lungs. No lungs. They haven't got a heart. No heart. Heartless. And they're made up of like, 97% water. Yes, they are. So they're pretty useless, really. Well, they have got a nervous system. They are actually about 650 million years old. So they. They've evolved and they've outlived the dinosaurs and they're even older than the sharks and they can even out fo because NASA scientists Have worked with them to try and work out how they operate in weightlessness and they still don't know how they do that. Took them into space, actually, to figure out how that they did, how they did that. Seems like a bit of a waste of money. Do you know Port Maddock? I used to go there a lot for my holidays and there used to be a load of them washed up on the beach. People on motorbikes used to go over them and stuff. Yeah, well, we get the moon jellyfish. That's the ones with the. They've got pink bits in the middle. That's their reproductive body. I think that was them. I think they're the ones who went over on the bike because you could see pink bits. What do they do if the jellyfish went, would we have a problem on our hands, do you think? Okay, you might have a bit of a knock on effect because things like turtles eat jellyfish. Yeah, but do we need turtles? Well, don't forget that when you take out one, when you take out something from the marine system, something normally feeds on. I mean, they're not just there for the fun of it. Something either feeds on it or feeds on what they excrete. What you're saying is they exist to sort of feed others and also to eat some stuff that's. Well, yeah, they control the population of other fish and species that might otherwise be a problem. Okay, well, let's kind of wrap this up, right? The question that I'm asking today is do we need them? Say if. Say if. Noah. Yeah. At his ark, right? You're, you know, you've swam and got on the boat, you're all right, you're safe. He's going to keep you to sort of populate the world as well. Right. So it's you and him. He's not a bad looking fella. So. So you're happy? Yeah. He says to you, vicky, do we need them? Absolute. I don't even know why she even gave you that interview. When you start off with, right, yeah, trying to find out if I need you. But what did you tell her to get her to talk to you? Just, just said, I'm doing some research on stuff. Did you think you were a schoolboy or something? No, she just, she just said, all right, she said, you know, how long will it go on? It's not long, just like five minutes. Have a quick chat. And she was, she was loved it, didn't she? She sounded happy to take part in that. So I love the fact that you've got an expert. And you, you suggest that she's going to be having sex with Noah. He's a good info. So you're happy she goes, yeah, I mean, I don't know why you stopped there, didn't go into positions or something. I, I, I can't believe the problem. Is really, I didn't get to the bottom of what I wanted to say because. Oh, no, you did. That's it. That's a, that's done now. That's a pretty good academic work that's proved, you know. But the turtle thing, you know, when she said, oh, if you get rid of them, you know, won't have anything to eat. But when she said that, I mean, I couldn't say it because it would have took her off and confused her. But she's a scientist, she's easily confused. Say like when, when Suzanne is working, right? I'm not a very good cook, so I always get like an Indian in. Right now say if for some reason it closed, I get a Chinese. So why, why don't the turtle just. There's loads of stuff in the sea. But I think I didn't want to get too heavy on her, but it's pretty deep. Oh, that is genius. But we'll look at. But so the fact that she said, yes, you need, you need jellyfish. Does that mean that you've changed your, I mean, what I'm saying is, does her answer go, does that stand? It does. It does, yeah. Whatever that I get the expert to say. I try and get them in a corner. Right? You try, yeah. Argue into a corner. Argument into a corner. But that time she wasn't having any of it, so we've got to carry on having them. Yeah. So in, in the new year, we'll be looking at octopus. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Great place. And feeder David Bowie. Everyone says hi. It's quite a melancholy feeling about today's show, isn't it? That Christmas, I think there's car with his Victoria Plum. I want to see a Victoria Plum. I want to know what it is. Is it, does it look like a little gnome? It's a, it's a woman gnome. A female gnome? Yeah, a little gnome. And did your mum collect gnomes? She likes anything gnomes, she likes fairies, she likes Indians, she collects all that stuff and it doesn't matter what it is, you know, like a proper Indian with all the ad gear on Native American. She likes anything with M on. Like, it can be a fridge magnet. It can be, yeah. Just, just a lot of Native American wisdom is, is around the fridge magnet, because I think it has special powers of adhesion. Yeah, yeah, that's. You read some of their. Their writings, the great works. Now, it reminds me, talking of gnomes, he said to me in the Week, he went, oh, did you see that program on telly last night about dwarves and fellows without legs nicking cars? And I went, no. He went, oh, it's amazing, right, because they haven't got legs and that. They scoot along and they can nip into a car like the Dukes of Hazard. Explain more, Carl. No, you see, I didn't see it. Someone else told me about it. Oh, that's what I said to you. I said, did you see it? Because I missed it. And it's about these. These little fellas who specialize in car nicking. And the thing I wanted to know is because this lad who you sort of watched it, only watched half of. It, is he like you? Well, I said, I can understand how it's easy to get in, but then how do you get away? Because you can't reach the pedals. Yeah. Can there be two of them? But presumably he opens the car for someone else. What is it? What do you mean, what? So he's staring and he's like, right. Press the brake a bit and then there's. Then there's one that's just legs, but without the top half. I don't understand how this helps them, though. What are they? Why are they. Why does this make it easier for them? Because they can just get through the window really quickly, like in the Dukes of Aziza. Because their legs don't get in the way. Right. Do they just run and just. But what do you mean, the wind? I mean, what? So someone's driving along. I didn't see it. I didn't. I didn't see. They leap in when there's someone still driving the car. I don't know. Well, there's too many things left unanswered here. I can't go in. But that sort of. This panicked you anyway, I imagine. I bet you were gutted you missed that program, weren't you? Yeah, well, I would. I'm interested in stuff like that because I like learning. Which gets us on to Educating Ricky. Oh, excellent, Slick. We had a good year of stuff. Yeah, I've learned a lot. Can you remember any of that? Of course I can. There was a Death girl and she hit her head and she could hear. There was also some people who ate tomatoes, thought they're poisonous on lead. There was also a fella who. A doctor who gave a blood transfusion with some parrots from the pet store. Yeah. Because the doctor in America, and it was the olden days when the lines were bad, said, give him his parents blood. And the doctor this side thought said, give him some parrot's blood. So that was true and that educated me. It was facts. What have you got for us? Well, we've only got two because I've taught you about jellyfish today, that we need them. So we've only got two. Two things to go at. And the. I give them a little headline so you remember them to make them snappy. The two headlines you've got. Oh, what a cato strophe. Okay. And the second one is. Well, you'd think it beat bug head, wouldn't you? What? Well, you'd think it beat bug head, wouldn't you? You'd think it beat. No, you'd think it be. Yeah, I think it'd be buggered, wouldn't you? This can't be. If this is anything with a bug, living without a head, I'm not interested. Because we've done it. All you've done is. Let's just do that. No, do the bug head one. Right. Well, the book, the forehead one. We've talked to a lot about animals and aren't we without heads? Surprisingly, we have, I think, a disproportionate amount on it. If you're a new listener, this is the first time you listen. You'll be surprised. We've covered worms the way if you cut their head off, it grows back if you don't cut two too. Too high above its neck. We've covered the chicken. The fella who blinked. Yeah. I can't go into it again. Right. Let's not go into it again. We've had the chicken. We know, Ed, that lived for eight months. Yeah. And we've had. She's living for a week without an egg. Right. Okay. It's a bit more on. On the cockroach front, really. Right. They found, right. That if you get a cockroach. Yeah. And you cut its head off. Yeah. Right. And then you find a cockroach that's still got its head, but it hasn't got any legs. Right. Right. It's not over for both of them. Right. Because what you can do, you get the one that's got the legs. Right. With no Ed, you're sort of running around. Get the one with the head, sit it on top of it. Right. Get a little tube. Okay. So that. The fluids. So is this. Is this Auntie's gone out of the room. This is like Blue Peter. You can get. You could get this for Christmas, right? You get a little tube. You set that on top so the bodily fluids are still running between the two. Right. The head of the one on the top will control the feet of the one on the bottom. Okay. What about that? Good. And will it continue to live? Yeah. Okay. You don't know that for sure, do you? It was just. That was just a question out of the blue. He wasn't expecting. What do you think of that? Good. Yeah, it's great. Yeah. Just a primitive nervous system that can. Yeah, yeah. Did you expect us to be more impressed and excited by that? Did you fall off your chair when you read that? Did you think you were going to be the Frankenstein of the insect world? Yeah, I just was thinking, if they can do that, that, you know, can they do it with humans? Because I also did a bit of research. Did you ever. Did you have the sort of conclusion that apart from the moral aspect of it, that the human was probably more complicated than. Yeah, but I mean, things. Things move on, don't they? Modern science, Rick. You know, I had. I had been a Tone as a kid. Now they've got PlayStation 2 and the difference in 10 years, they have found that if. If you lose your head, a cockroach can live normally on your body but not the other way around. Your head on. It cannot control his legs because it's too complicated for your brain. So, yeah, so then, then all the research. Because I thought, if you don't learn from that, I'll give you something else for free, right, that they can clone people. The only reason they don't do it, right, say if, like, Ricky needed a lung, right, they could clone you and make you the same. But the only reason they don't want to do it is because it'd be a bit horrible, wouldn't it? And it would. And it would take sort of 18 years for me to get an adult lung. And there's all kinds of moral implications. Yeah. What do you mean? Yeah, you hadn't thought so. Sorry. So. Because lest we forget, Rick, he ended with. The only reason they don't do it is because it's a bit horrible in that. Which scientist said that? That's a quote. That's not it. That's not the other one. That's it. No, no, no, no. That was. That was just, you know, we've got. Another one to come. Oh, I can't wait. The headline again. What was the headline again? The headline oh, what a cat. Toastrophy. Looking forward to that, Mark. Yeah, a bit more kind tour from his covers album. This is called Snowbird Snowbird from Mark. Heights are part of his covers album. He's so happy that. That the X Men listeners understand his stupid clues and he knows it annoys me. The answers just quickly, just in case someone. So I missed one of them, I'll just quickly do them. Yeah, yeah go on first one. There's a lot. There's a load of letters there asking for advice. Put them on Claire's desk. Oh, a Merry Christmas. Ask your mom if you should. Oh, and Merry Christmas. A couple of people were arguing in the supermarket. It was Christmas, that's why. And that's b. Okay, we'll give those answers out shortly. Yeah, I just have to show you something Rick, before we move on I know we've got another educating Ricky, but someone just sent this in. They've been looking on ebay for Victoria Plum. Yeah, joking. Come here and see the photograph. Oh God, that's fantastic. That's it. Oh God, he got that for his mug. It's the worst piece of tat I've ever seen. Carl. Oh, Carl, imagine how gutted. Imagine how think of him now. Right, there it is. That's the worst thing I've ever seen. I don't. It looks like a diddy man gone wrong. It looks like a diddy man prostitute that is. Well, it was a different color out of yellow at mine. How do they get telling them. Okay, so going to ebay. So you need to. To log on to ebay.co.uk I'm sure you've used it before. It's the online marketplace e b a y.co.uk and if you type in Victoria Plum, I'm assuming that you. That's amazing. It's the worst piece of rubbish. Just think how cute he was as a kid though doing that. Just think of him just going. Just seeing that and thinking she likes gnomes. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. I mean to be fair, I mean I don't know what her prize collection of gnomes looks like but I can't imagine they're much better than that. I mean gnomes are fairly grotesque thing but certainly your mum's taste and discretion is. Did you have any. Did you have those houses on your estate? You'd go in there and it was just. Just loads of those dolls still in their packaging all around the room and sort of like one of those homes that keeps the sort of packaging on the three piece suite. Why don't you buy another one for her for Christmas? Yeah, it's 3.99 it looks, but that's £2 49 because that was 3.99. Well. Oh, buy it, Carl. I've sorted out her passport this year anyway. I'll get her that next year. Okay, so just educating Ricky of the year. Oh, God, what a cat. Yeah, let's do that. Then there's this woman, right? Yeah, this woman, she's reading Guinness Book of Records. Yeah. And she, she's flicking through and she notices that there's a world record for a cat, right, with 27 toes. So she reads it and she thinks, well, that's not right because her cat's got 28. What do you mean her cat's got 28? Her cat's got 28 toes. So she was like, well, hang on a minute, mine should be in there. So I missed the very beginning of this. The one with the cat with 28 toes looking through and it said the record for the cat's toes was 27. She thought, hold on, hold on a minute. Ross McWhirter. My cat's got one more than that cat. So go on. Anyway, so she said, you know, the person doing the interview with her said, you know, is it happy? And she said, yeah, yeah, you know, she. It's great and it's, it's really good in the snow, right? It gets through a lot of nail varnish. Well, yeah, that's, that's what he said, right? He said, it's really good in the snow. So I just was thinking, I mean, that's it, really. That's not it. That's the end of that story. Brilliant. But what I'm thinking is, right, it. Was two cats welded together. No, she, she said, you know, it's happy. So is the other sort of disabilities where, in a way it's not all bad. Oh, Christ, no. Do you know, like that book Steve brought in for me? And there was a fella there, one of you had three legs, who was a juggler. And I was like, what's the point of that? What's the point of that? What's the point? He's not taking advantage of having three legs, is he, being a juggler? Yeah, he said he should be a football. So. No, but in a way he's used it, hasn't he? He's probably not even that good at juggling. But because he's got three legs, people have gone, well, give him a chance, let's go and see him Anyway, see if he's any good. Yeah, right. So what I'm thinking is, is there anything else? We've mentioned the. The midgets today who are good at robbing cars because they can get through the windows, like Duke's advisors. So. Sorry. So listen, listen, look, I'd just like to say this is a radio authority listening. We are in no way suggesting that that one midget's forte in life is robbing cars or that if you're a midget sitting at home feeling sorry so that you should go out robbing cars, I just, like, say, this is Carl Pilkerton talking. The views of Carl Pilot not necessarily. Reflect those of XFM or us. Yeah, but it was a TV program, so it's not me. I'm just saying what I've seen on tape that you didn't see that somebody told me about. Yeah, just so you could be wrong. Just like a lot of your spurious facts you just see on the Internet. You know, I'm just saying. Yeah. So is there anything else? We've seen the fellow with three legs. So what you're saying is, is there a disability that is actually an advantage? Yeah. Right. Okay. Steve mentioned about the disabled, Lou. They're always really roomy and like, got multi gym facilities in them. Multi gym facilities? Multi gym facilities? What do you mean, Carl? There's always bars everywhere on that, isn't it? That's not parallel bars. Yeah, they don't do gymnastics. I'm just. I'm just saying, though. Do you know what I mean? So in a way, they've. They've got that. So always. What I'm saying is, when you look on the brighter side, it's like Elephant man would have never got up and gone, oh, look at me hair today. Nor do you. No, but he would never have that problem. You're a maniac. Forget it. I thought we'd be able to get a serious discussion going here. Well, okay then. So this is a serious discussion, is it? Yeah. Okay, well, let's treat it sensitively then. If you really want a serious discussion and talk about whether there are some disabilities at our advantage, let's think of some then, shall we? Well, I've said three already. Yeah, you can't say if you're deaf, Bobby Daver won't annoy you. That doesn't count as an advantage. Do you understand? Do you know what I mean? I was looking at you thinking, that's brilliant. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we'll leave it then. I'll come up with a better feature for Next year. Oh we'll bend that, we'll bend that. Whipping that like that was going to be a feature but you were hoping. That that would be a spin off feature. Disabilities are actually. Well it's another form of do we need them? It's like. But that, can't think of it. It's like that, it's like that joke. The bloke that as his wakes up in hospital says good news and bad news. Bad news is we've had to appetite both legs. What's the good news? The fellow in the next bed wants to buy your slippers. See that's not an advantage, it's a joke that doesn't really happen. People don't go, oh that is good news. Yeah, I'd probably get a quid firm, do you know what I mean? But the fellow with three feet, what would he do? Well he'd buy a pair and then just nick one of those because they put out one shoe, don't they? Are those. Yeah, if you've got one leg you can nick shoes. Good point Carl. Now I'm getting you thinking. Yeah, right, so we'll do Rockbusters answers next then. So this is Christmas. John, Emmy, Happy Christmas. War's over and all that. Indeed, yeah. Brilliant, brilliant tune, great tune and I've had a great time. I've had a great time. Merry Christmas everybody. I hope we haven't offended you by some of Carl's ranting. Just think, just, just think of what he's gone through in his life. The Victoria Plum incident. Carl, I've got a little gift for you here before we go. Oh, you're joking. I've got you anything. Well no, you haven't got your girlfriend anything. I wasn't expecting much. It's not, it's not exciting but it's worth taking. In fact you could. Why don't you just re gift that straight away? It's all right. Cheers for that. Yeah, it doesn't even looked at it. That's not the champagne we got free from the BBC is it? It's not actually, no Rick, because that is far too good for the likes of Carl. Oh right, and I wasn't gonna give it to me, he wouldn't appreciate it. That's just sparkling wine. Oh brilliant. Oh I love that. Yeah, he does know the difference. I'm seeing Carl on Christmas Day cuz he's around Christmas day in London. So I'll get a little gift then Carl. All right, that'd be good, wouldn't it? It'd be a nice little okay, Answers. We must give the answers. You would have to go to bed at 6, though, so we can play. Right, here's the last clues of the year you had. There's a load of letters there asking for advice. Put them on Claire's desk. That was for Foreigner. For Raina. I don't know what you mean. Claire Rayner, she took advice. She gave people advice. So that's a foreigner. That is right. I'm sorry. Maybe Christmas. That is absolute stars. A lot of people got the right answer. I know. Well, that annoys me even more. Number two, Foreigner. Foreigner. Second one. Ask your mom if you should. That was s. That was Shalimar. Shalamar. Right. Now, bizarrely, what was the clue there? Ask your mum if you should. Now we got a lot of people saying Smashing Pumpkins as the answer to that. I don't know who's saying that today. Mum. Smashing Pumpkins. Merry Christmas, Mum. Smashing Pumpkins. Thanks very much. Nice bollocks. Oh, that's great. That's great. Smashing Pumpkins. Your dad bought them for me for Christmas. And the last one, Lovely plums. What My victorious. Oh, God, we've got it. We gotta wrap it up. Come on, then. A couple of people were arguing in the supermarket at the Fruit and veg. That was b. That was Banana Drama. You were like having an eye drop. Wait, wait, wait. What group is Banana Drama? What group is Banana Drama? You're a fool. You're a twat when you say that. But you accuse her, you accuse Carl of that. You're also accusing lots of the listeners, including the winner, Nicola Rogers of London. And she wins those great prizes and she got them bang on. So Banana Drama. So can we finish there now? Yeah. What do you mean? What do you mean, can we finish there now? Let's just play the ads and go. What? No. What are you talking about? We're going to play Jing it all day. That then, goodness. We go. Look at you. We haven't got time. Merry Christmas, Car. Enjoy the. Let's give a little kiss with tongues. With tongues. It's Christmas. Coming on Christmas. They're cutting down trees.",
