It's noisy again out there. It's a nightmare. A lot of people marching up and down. What's that about? Well, from what I can work out, there's hundreds of them, millions of them, and they'll. And they're all shouting really loudly. What do we want? Peace. When do we want it? Now. What do we want? Peace. I want to go shush. Yeah, we all want a bit of peace on a Saturday. Keep it down, please. I can barely hear myself think. I know. And he's not listening. Tony's not listening. He can't even. There. You may as well give up. He's not listening. There was a million of you last time. It didn't do anything. Hey, but Steve, there's no attitude. You know what I couldn't find? Boy George's War. War is stupid. So is a bit of Dylan. Come gather around, people, wherever you. Bob Dylan. The times, they are a change. The thing is, Rick. Thing is, Rick, it makes me wonder if the times, are they changing? I mean, it seems to me that life's pretty much the same as it was way back in the 60s when Bob Dylan wrote that song. Got any idea what you're talking about? No idea whatsoever. You don't really know about politics. Know anything about it. Don't even read the papers. Got no interest, really. Not particularly informed. My life's cushy. I got. Won some awards and stuff. Doesn't bother me. So, on a serious note, though, it is a bit worrying. I want somebody to put on my. Do I have to get gas masks or something? No, because there are guys out there in Leicester Square today wearing novelty hats. If they don't sort this war out, then no one can. Okay, well, not see you. You would worry about it. I would worry about it? Well, you maybe, Steve. Why sort of people who were successful are worrying about it more than other people? Just go on. Well, they've got more to lose, haven't they? Right? No. Do you know what I mean? You see, like Bruce Willis on the tell, he's saying, oh, it's not good, is it? And it's because he's got a big house and loads of cars. If you live, you know, on a council estate, it's like, well, if it gets bombed, probably doing us all a favor. We'll get nice new blocks of flats to live in and that. It happened with Manchester, with the bomb that happened. And they bombed the Arndale Centre, did us a favor, got a nice new Marks and Spencers and that. So this. Hold on. This puts a whole new twist to the argument when people say bombing the world's poorest countries is wrong. Because I remember when the Afghan problem was on people saying bombing the world's poorest country is wrong. But it's like Home Improvement according to you, then? Yeah, because they've got a brand new B and Q. Have they? Overnight. They're popping down there every Sunday. Let's not go on about it. Whoa. Think what you're saying. Yeah, I know my family was killed, but look, a carpet warehouse. Yeah. Do you know, I think, you know, people don't want to hear about this today from us. They want to hear, you know, the new features, the Songs of Phrase. What songs? A phrase. It's the feature we started last week where we take clips of songs, we make up a phrase from the show. I mean, a famous phrase. Last. Last week's world famous phrase was. There's this airy Chinese kid you'll remember. Yes, well, it was. It was called Crosswords last week, but Phil emailed in a good suggestion and said, call it songs. A phrase. Brilliant. Songs Off Phrase. Songs Off Phrase. But perfect. So are we still going with Cheapest Chimps? We're persevering with that. I've got some Cheapest chimps lined up. We'll be doing that before 3:00. Yeah, great. Again, who else can say that? So good. So for the next two hours, everyone should just bury their head in the sand, ignore the world's problems and enjoy features such as Cheapest Chimps and tons. Of Phrase and a better cheering break. Trying to stop suddenly in Ital tb Turing breaks. It's like a rock buster, Carl. Remember the good old days. I know, yeah. Painkiller on XFM 104.9. But look, Rockbusters is gone. Forget Rockbusters. Long live Songs Of Phrase. Over to you, Carl. All right. Well, you know, Rockbusters was one of the things they were protesting about next last time. That was why I just had to listen to them. They just kept stopping me in the street as I was trying to get to the tube. You've got to stop Rockbusters. It's run out of steam, they said. And I'm glad. That's why they always do it on a Saturday. Yeah. They make their way to Leicester Square for 3 o'clock. Song is A phrase. What it is. Song's a phrase. Gone. We took a phrase from the show last week. It was. There's this airy Chinese kid. Right, Today we're going back to the good old line of about, you never see an old man eating a Twix. Sure. How long is that? No, you'll never see an old man eating a Twix. You'll never see an old man eating a Twix. Not as many as you think, though. It's not that many. Well, how is it not that many? Right. Well, first of all. Anyway, don't worry about that. I think there's about five, I think. Hang on a minute. Oh, God. Why do we leave them alone to do this? I don't understand. I mean, it's like. I'll tell you what, we were flying. Six different songs. Six different songs. That's a lot to get, Carl. But what happened is I couldn't find a song with Twix, so we've changed the chocolate. Oh, this is ravage. We're not doing it. We're not doing it. No. You've got to be punished. We're not doing this. Doing that. No, no, no, no. Shut up, Carl. No, no, no, no. He's put a lot of effort in. So what? You're right. He's got to do it right. He's got to do it right. There's too many. We said too many. It's not. He's changed the thing. It's not one of. It's ridiculous, Rick. If only his parents had spoken like that to him sometimes in the past. We were having this discussion. You're not doing it. Come on. No, we're not doing it, Steve. What? What do you think? I'll tell you. We've got the prizes, but I'm not even going to bother. I'm not even sharing that amongst. Right. Homeless. Absolutely. No, there's. There's troubles in the world and I'm not going to let you faff around doing nonsense like that. It's ridiculous. Let's do it for this. No, let's play a beautiful song. What do you think? I'd love to hear a great song. They are the times they are changing. We've said that. Look at Mother Nature on the run. Look at Mother Nature on the run. Steve. Yeah, Play it. So we're not doing. No, it's your own fault. Neil Young, after the Gold Rush, one of the most beautiful, poignant songs ever. Great lyrics in that. Look at Mother Nature on the run in the 1970s. I forget the 1970s Rick. I'm beginning to wonder if that's just as truthful nowadays in the year 2003. You'Ve got no idea. You don't know anything about the world or politics so I don't know why you persist. I don't know why I keep saying to myself Rick, I'm a political incompetent. I don't know why I keep spouting on with this drivel. Right, it's the Guardian I think that's doing it to me it's all second hand information. I just read it in there and I just thought it was a good idea to. Exactly. I keep thinking don't really care do you? About anything in the world really. I haven't exactly. Unless I'm personally affected by these things I don't care less. Well I'm the same. Now Carl, the big question as we know at the moment is whether we're going to let you do songs of phrase or not. Rick, I should tell you now there has been a flood of. Oh no there hasn't, sorry. I was thinking there'd been a flood of emails but people agreeing with you Rick. I know Tony Blair has been trying to get through. Yeah, exactly. I'm just checking the emails now. There's absolutely nothing supporting you Carl. No one gives Assad either way about. No. Well that's not fair. There were a couple of phone calls, weren't there? One was a guy saying you should. I think the other one was you Carl. Was it phoning from the kitchen? Can we do it? Can we do it right? No, if you don't like it we won't do next week. But you've made it. I don't know what, I don't know why you did that. I. We thought of lots of stuff that you could do. You chose one where you have to have 10 words and six songs to choose. You haven't got Twix. I don't know what you've substituted Twix for. Yeah, I mean I got to say now I'm going to sit on the fence here, I'm quite intrigued. Okay, right. What have you substituted Twix for? Well I can't cuz. You can. No I can't because people have to listen to it and work out. Alright, let's just hear it. Let's hear it then. No, no, no, no, no. They know what. They have to know what the word is. They have to tell what the song is or the artist. I prefer just to play it. No, you've got to tell Them what it is. They might not even know what word they're looking for. Let's just. Let's hear him out, Rick, please. Democracy, that's what we're fighting for. Come on, turn them up. Right, okay, I've got the earphones on. Go on, then. Okay, so. Right, hang on. The phrase originally was. Is you never see an old man eating a Twix. Right. And we're the. Well, a number of songs which you've used to make up that phrase. And you email in xfm.co.uk Ricky with as many as you can get and whoever gets the most. Right. It's so complicated. This is so complicated. Here we go. I'm baffled by the email address. Email address again, xfm.co.uk Ricky Right, right. And there's some link on there, is there? Yeah, you just press and it comes through. Right, here we go then. Right. And you never. See an old man. I missed a little bit at the end. Let's hear it again. Let's hear it again. Let's hear it again. Oh, God. Okay, so we'd say the prizes, Steve. Right, so how many songs were there? Do we know? I think there was six. You think there was six? And you'll never see an old man eat. Oh, it might be 5. 5 or 6. Anyway, emailing the answers and how many there were and you might be in with a chance of winning. On dvd, the original series of Citizen Smith with Robert Lindsay. That was good. Paul Whitehouse's Happiness, the first series of that on DVD. We've also got a couple of CDs here. The best of Brit Pop Live Forever, Oasis, Blur, Radiohead and all the rest of them. Supergrass's current album as well. I think it's a current album. Yeah, it is. And less convinced by this one. If I tell you that some of the artists include Delametri and Deacon Blue, then I know you'll be rushing out later, Rick, to buy this. Scotland Rocks. A compilation of. Is Wet, Wet, Wet on there? Let's see. What about this? What happened to Bis? Let me see. I'm not gonna. I tell you, it doesn't. I mean, we've got Gun on there. We've got Baby lately. Aztec Camera. Yeah, big country. Obviously Procaimer's not on there. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Where's. Run Rick? There they are, There they are. And obviously Rafferty, Baker Street. Brilliant. So that's. That's definitely worth entering for, surely. So. Xfm.co.uk Ricky, play it one more time. Class Pure Class. Well done. All right. Oasis, Stop crying your heart out on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais, with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl's competition is in full swing. Now. I just will remind you, when playing songs of phrase and trying to guess the. The songs and artists. What do you want, songs or artists? I think songs. Yeah. All right. But that's ambiguous, isn't it, what a song title is, where you know the artist. Definitely. Maybe the artist cleans it up. Really? Yeah, yeah, Artists, Okay. You know, if they know what it is, because that stop any ambiguity, won't it? And don't worry if you haven't got all of them because the winner last week didn't have all of them. But it's the. The closest one. I understand. When you're trying to guess what's in Carl's mind, you can only get so close. Do you know what I mean? He wants us to bring in Derren Brown because he won't be able to read my mind. And I think he's right. I think he might. I think he's the one person that could outwit Derren Brown. Yeah. Now, moving on. Carl, should we just play it very quickly? Just play again. Go on in one more time. It sums a phrase because it. Because. Because you have to get, you know, it is very difficult. So, you know, song or artist. We give points if you're. If you're close any of those and we'll choose a winner. So, you know, do. And what the points mean. Crap. Prizes. Xfm xfm.co.uk. Right now, we got people to send in a little thing for you last week, didn't he, the film freak. So you got a few, you got a few sent in. You watched it, did you? Yeah. Now, I should just point out that the film Freaks for those that Don't Know was a movie that was released, I think, in the. Well, actually it was deleted. It was originally made in about 1932, something like that, and then it was delayed. It was banned for many, many, many years because it did, in actual fact, feature, for want of a better phrase, real life freaks, bearded ladies being one of the more kind of familiar ones, all sorts. And it was actually quite. It's quite a tender film, isn't it? And actually portrays them as a kind of dysfunctional family. It's not. It's not exploitative in that sense. But what do you make of it, Carl? Well, you're watching it for the Freaks, weren't you? Yeah, I mean, I wish. It does take a while to get onto it. What do you mean? Well, straight away I was disappointed, right? Because at the start, like, you put it in, it's like, oh, brilliant, here we go. You know, I said to Suzanne, we'll watch this. Have a good night. Yeah, have a romantic night. You've got your gloves. Now we're gonna watch some freaks. So put it on. And it starts off and it's like, you know, the following film, he think, oh, it's like following films rated 15. Which means, you know, might contain scenes of violence, bad language and sex. Mention nothing about pinheads, right? So I thought they missed a trick there. Yeah. So I thought, well, let's watch. What exactly is a pinhead? Oh, if you've seen it, you'd know. Okay, right. So not the best thing in it either. So imagine that. Okay. So you're watching it. So sat there, I think, right? Something comes on and the little fellas on there, the little fellow we were talking about, the pillow man, is he. The best thing, innit? Now, what's the pillow man again? Is a fella who, years ago, he's got no arms and legs, Right. He's just a torso, just rolls. Yeah. And there's a scene where you see him sort of rolling a cigarette up, just using his mouth and it's like he lights it and stuff. And that's weird. And then what else is on it? Smoke and stench of growth. And then there's a. There's a little. Little fella on it who is fed up because he looks five, but he's actually 34. Right. But there's a woman who is 42 and looked eight. So they both had the opposite thing. They were both really fed up. And I kind of thought that shows that, you know, you always want what someone else has got. Sure. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. So in a way, there's a story there. Yeah. No, that you described the same there. No, no, no, it was like. No, they both. You just said they. They both looked young, but they are actually both older. No, no, this was like a little man. Yeah. Who was 35. He was 35 and looked 8. Yeah. And so did she. No. Well, the other way around then. What, so she was an 8 year old that looked 35? Yeah. Oh, maybe not then, anyway. No, but that wasn't that weird. I kind of thought it's slow start on that. Yeah. And then it's not. It's not a difficult film to follow. No. Yeah, but I wasn't really listening to what it's all about just looking at what they had. And they had, like, a fella who's. Running about on the head like he. Was shopping, you know. They had a fella with no legs and he's running about on his hands and sort of got about on a skateboard talking to someone about it. They said that's how ET was done. There's actually a little fella in et, right, who's just half of sort of half a body. Is that true? I have no idea. I've never heard that before. We heard that before. Never heard that before. I don't think he would fit in ET because it wears the head. He's got no neck. Et, It's a skinny little thing. There's no human neck. Couldn't fit in that skinny little neck. You sure it wasn't Kenny Baker up to his old tricks? What are you talking about, Carl? There's a fellow with no legs in ET. In et, they had two. Two fellas, right? I think they had a little. A midget fella, right, who did it. And then I think he was off sick. And they were like, oh, you know, what else are we gonna do? So they saw a guy on a. Skateboard going by and said, do you fancy some work? Right? And he's done it. I think someone told me. I mean, it might be. Exactly. Might be wrong. He might be. Might. I mean, you've never been wrong before, so I don't know why you'd be wrong there. So what's the worst thing in it now? It's intriguing to me because here's a film called Freaks, featuring real life freaks, and you're sort of a bit nonplussed by it. Just because it wasn't. Because it's built up. If you call a video Freaks, you've got to make sure that there's some good stuff on there. Yeah. What were you disappointed about? Was it that. Because there was a few things on it, right? There was a woman who said she was half man, half woman. And it's like, well, you're not, are you? It was just like she had some makeup on. I thought, well, that's rubbish. Then there was a woman who could eat using her feet. That isn't that freaky, do you know? I mean, if she's not hungry, she looks normal. And that's what I was thinking. I mean, I'm not being. Not being right, Steve, you know, I'm not being funny. Oh, here we go. No, no, but I'm just saying, if that woman wasn't Eating. And you were sat next to her in that film. Yeah. I'd probably be sort of drawn to you more than her. I'm not. I know you hate me saying it, but there's no point sort of pretending. Do you know what I mean? Oi, Mutley, what are you sniggering about? Well, you mean there were things in it that were less. What are you saying? I'm just saying, play a record. Seriously, I'll slap you. I'm gonna slap you live on air. Yeah, but you always go, I'm slapping. You live on air, I swear to God. Play a song then. Bruce Springsteen, Atlantic City from the album Nebraska. So melancholy. That one. I love that one. Wow. So freaks, then. All in all, not. Not as. Not as amazing as you first hoped it was. It was built up too much. Do you know, really, like, is that my fault for getting you excited? I just can't believe I hand you this thing on a plate. And I'm not. I'm not being out of order, Steve. I'm just. I'm just being honest. We've always said that about this show. We only talk about stuff, you know. Yeah. You know, being honest and that. Yeah, sure. And I've always said the first time I saw you. Sure. No, no, you've always been honest, and I've always been honest with you. I've always said that, you know, you've got the. You've got the intelligence and insight of a gnat. Yeah, but if I. If I keep quiet, people don't know that. Sure. All right. They're incredibly, incredibly. Carl. Because you look stupid as well. Well, you know. Yeah, no, but Carl was being nice then. You don't. You don't. I'm just saying you're a good bloke and now I've got to know you. Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The first time was weird when I saw you. Yeah. No, no, I'm just. I'm just saying. Yeah, it was weird and that. And then weeks go by, and the weird thing is I kind of thought, maybe he's not that odd looking. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then you went to LA for three weeks. Sure. And when you came back, it was like the first time again. Right? Yeah. Okay, okay. No, stop it now. Yeah, yeah. Everyone stop it now. No, but I just think I'm a little bit more consistent because I've always thought you were. I don't want this. Don't argue. He was just. Okay. No, I just didn't. You know what I mean? My opinion has never Changed. I've always thought you're. You're in. No, it's just all nice. Let's look, let's look. Peace. Shut up, Fat. So. Peace, not war. He's just such a stir, isn't he? He loves it. I don't think I didn't see you. Whispering behind the microphone about what to say to Carl. I've just drawn Carl subconsciously. Yeah. Let's see. I'll do a picture of him. It's not going to be on the website. It's not been on the website? No, it's going to be. I drew a little cartoon of him. No, not yours. I'll do one. Carl. Right, okay. What are we talking about? How was it? So, yeah, no, the freak. It's over and done with. It was all right. If you want to get it out on video, you know, it's probably worth a look. There's a couple of things on there that get you thinking more, you know, it's like how their life is and stuff. Do you know? I mean, how it's affected and like the little pillow man or the fellow who's got half of his body missing. Yeah, you know, it's stuff like that that you think. But what's the. The one that would disappoint? You said it was a half man, half woman. Yeah, I don't quite understand that one. Do you mean hermaphrodite or half? I can't remember it. You mean it was one sort of like it had bits of both. It was just like half, half a face done in makeup and long hair. Then on the other side it changed. I love the idea that you go to this circus and there's people in there that have been sort of persecuted all their life. And I think, well, maybe I can make some money. And then you boo them because they're not freakish enough. I love the idea they got. Boo. You're not freakish enough. Boo. Oh, you've got bits of legs. Boo. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, but there was, I mean, talking about that, you see, why did they get joined the circus and that. Because there are things they can do. I was telling you in the week that I was reading something on some news website about some sort of Olympic style games where they're gonna see like disabled people against able bodies. Right, let's be careful there, shall we? No, I'm just saying though, okay. Do you know, I mean, so there is other things. It doesn't mean just because you haven't got legs, you can't do Other stuff. Yeah. And in this race there's like disabled people who are beating able bodied people. Yeah. Would you go and see that? I don't know, but I mean, it depends. What, what, what do you mean? They're beating him. At what? I. He didn't state what the. What the little races were and that. Little races. Can't help himself. Little races. Oh, look, there's the disabled with their. Little races having another little race. Oh, dear. Would you go. Would you go on, watch that. Do you remember when Jimmy thought that Paralympics stood for paraplegic Olympics? The Paralympics, yeah. It means parallel Olympics. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He thought it meant paralegic. Paraplegic Olympics. That would be a good site, wouldn't it? Mainly blow football. Right, right, okay. So what was that thing I told you to look up in the week you were saying? I don't believe you. We're going on about. We were talking about the half man, half woman. Yeah. And you were saying you can get. You can get a sex change on the nhs. Just to see what you say about that. Did you look it up? I didn't because I think I was wasting my time. I don't think I'm giving all these things little. You wouldn't, you wouldn't do that. You do. You've annoyed Steve on air. I'm sorry about that. Well, it's just too late, Carl. But we were talking about other stuff as well. I mean, you know, talking about operations and that. You were saying, you know, can you have a sex change done on the NHS and that. No. You can. Well, you say you can. I think that's a bit. It's not that important to have done, I don't think. Well, it depends if you desperately want it. It depends if you think you feel that you're born actually a different sex. Right. And then you went on to say there's. There's other things that are done. Get this Steve someone if they want. If the cat's got a bad liver kidney, all right, bad kidney, can have it done for five grand. Yeah, you can have it. You can have a kidney operation, but. What'S wrong with that? If you've got five grand, you want to waste it on a cat, then. Fine, get another one. We went through loads of cats. I've told you before, as a kid, we got through loads. It's not worth it. And there's no cat that is that amazing that you go, gonna miss that one. It's never gonna be the same because. What do you mean? What would it have to Be able to do, to be worth it. It's normally to do with people's affection for their cat. They've had the pet for many years. What do you mean? It should be able to juggle or do impressions. And that's why it's worth, my friend. Supposing there was a fella, right, he feels he was born a woman. He's. He's not happy, right? He doesn't want this. The bat, he's got. He's got a knob and a test couple of testicles that he does not want, right? He wants a lovely pair of tits and a minge, right? And he finds out that he gets a cut price. He gets, you know, a cut price sort of operation. A dodgy backstreet transsexual maker, right? Five grand, knockdown price. Five grand. It's done with a. It's done with a blunt knife and. And some chloroform. Right, but. But why have you got it all done? What you mean just like may have the knob trimmed and wear a bra? Well, yeah, I mean, are you saying if you have it all done, you get some sort of offer if you give them something? No, no, I was being flippant. I'm saying I was trying to get down to five grand. Supposing there was a fellow you had five grand to give away, right? Some old woman with her cat is gonna die or some fella who wants his knob chopped off and a lovely pair of tits put on. Who would you give the five grand to? So hang on a minute. So there's a fella who wants to. Be a woman, yeah? And there's a woman who's got an ill cat. Yeah. You see, I'd be annoyed. Who's is this five grand? Is this my savings or. No, just you get given five grand and you go, but you gotta give it to a charity of your choice and it's gotta be one of them. You leave it right there. What? I'd find out what the cat looks like, get a replacement, right? Say it's had the op, she's loving it, thinking it's happy again. Yeah. Give the fella the money, right? You know what I mean? Well, so you're basically saying that you'd rather have the bloke have his knob cut off and stuff. I'd have to have a chat with him first and say, what's your problem? And say, why do you need this doing? I think they go through that. I think they go to counseling and live as a woman for a. Like a second opinion. Thing I'd just be saying, right, are you sure? Yeah. But five grand on a cat, even. It can only be for people who have got loads of money, right? And it's like, well, five grand, it's nothing. Well, I think this debate will rage on. Should we play a record and come back to this? Think about it, though. Yeah. Bit of White Stripes. Placebo. Bitter End on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais, with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl, you're looking all flustered and confused again. Still sort of don't get it. What don't you get? Well, that's a long list, Rick. Yeah, the. You know, if you have your knob calf. Yeah. It's because they feel like they're actually a born a woman and this. They're not living right. They can't live properly with all the these things, you know. Well, I mean, there, there are people that are genetically the. The other gender. They've just grown, you know. There was one woman actually was a scientist researching it and found out that she was a man. She had why chromosomes said, well, this is something different. This is. This is both psychological and everything else. Is that thing again. And you can't always have, you know, what you want. It's like, I'd like to have air. Do you know what I mean? But it's a bit easier. You can wear a wig. You can't go around really well. You can put on, you know, false breasts and tuck it in. That's just it as well, isn't it? You see, you. You say, you know, you could have the operation done and that, and, yeah, you might sort of feel as free as a woman down below and that. But at the end of the day, you still look like a fella. Yeah, here's a bra on a split tennis ball. No, we just like Auntie Nora. Do you know what I mean, though? Well, yeah, but it's about their outward appearance as well and how they feel publicly. Don't forget a transsexual. It's not a transvestite. This isn't just a builder in a dress. They have the hormone replacement as well, so they get estrogen, so an electrolysis. So they have, you know, they're. Their face looks different. They. They don't go bald. They're slight. Are they? They, you know, I mean that. It's the. They're the real thing. A transsexual is now the real thing biologically and politically and. But they still be a man, won't they? Well, it'd be embarrassing if they don't tell their new partner. And the. Let's picture them, you know, down the plug when they were 24. But you probably sort of get over that, don't you? That goes to the fellow with a beard drinking the Yard of ale. That was me. Well, interesting story. Probably should have told you this before the honeymoon. Do you know what I mean? It's like, you can have all that done, right? There's this stuff, you know, you could have your bits done, right? You can have, like, false teeth. But you know that when you see an old person with a good set of teeth, it's like, well, they're false. There's no way you've got good teeth like that if you were brought up in, like the 30s. But what would you do if Suzanne said, look, I've got a terrible secret. And she showed a picture of this kid, this little boy growing up, you know, playing football. And then the Pictures stop at 20, just before you met her, and she goes. And she shows you a nice pair of bollocks in a jar. She goes, they were mine. Well, first thing is, he'd take back the gloves you bought her last week. Would you go, oh, I can't go out with you now. Or would you say, well, you're the same person. I've blown his mind. I really have freaked him out. There she is, into sport. Should we play a record while you give her a call? No, but what I'm saying is it, right, it doesn't matter what you have done. We can wrap this up here because I've got it sorted, right, okay. Doesn't matter what you have done. At the end of the day, it's obvious that you've had it done. If you're a fella and you've been changed to a woman, I could spot you, right? If you can't, though, I tell you what, I was. I was at Suzanne's mum and dad's right up north last week. And I went to the off license, yeah. And I went in there, never seen this fella before, right? Soon as I walk in, I am up behind the counter, go, all right, mate? Oh, hello. I noticed he's got a wig on, Right? Yeah. Now, it was. I. I kind of looked and I thought, yeah, it's a wig, whatever. And then I thought, I wonder if it is. And as I got to the till, I said, how much is that? He said, you know, 50 pence, they're great. And as he turned to the till. Were you buying Suzanne a Gift. As he turned to the till and he did that sort of angle, you got the profile, you see the bit sticking out of the back, you go, that's a wig. I know what you mean. I know what you mean. It's like a little. It just. It just. The last inch just lifts away from the neck. Yeah, yeah. Everybody who goes in that shop will probably know him as having a wig and that. He keeps him happy. But everybody knows. So what I'm saying is, it's like. But could I just say, transsexuals put in a little bit more effort than a fella who's plunked a rug on top and held it down with some duct tape. Do you know what I mean? You know, the only giveaway often with a transsexual is the big hands. They can't do anything about that. That's the only thing, you know. But. But, I mean, trans. Transvestites are different, you know, they are bills and addresses. You go in a supermarket, you turn around, you see huge head, you go, all right, love. You know what I mean? You know, you don't. You know, down below, she's packing more than us three put together. That's what I'm saying. But, yeah, I mean, that. That's one of the. If. If Eddie is odd, right? Meeting Eddie is odd, right? Who likes to pop on a dress now and again, right? If. What's the politics with that? Do you go. Because he walks in, he's all in evening gown, he goes, all right, Carl, and you go, all right, Eddie, and it's in a busy pub, and you go, oh, what is he? And you go, do you say, do you want a pint of bitter and slap him on the back like. Or do you go, that's lovely. That's a lovely dress. Do you know what I mean? What do you do? What do you do with the transvestite? Would you compliment a transvestite on their. Lovely dress if he was wearing a. Nice dress in the same way that you would if Suzanne was wearing a nice dress? Probably a different way. I'd probably say that dress, you know, looks nice. Be even nicer on a woman. Do you know what I mean? So you try and you try and change the way they think. Yeah, yeah. You'd want to teach him a lesson? Yeah, sure, in a way, yeah. It's just. It's one of them things I can't get my head around, to be honest. Right? I can handle airy Chinese kids. Yeah. Is it true. Is it true to say that you've never been able to handle a transvestite. So I'm just gonna add that to the list, then, Carl, of things you can figure out. It's like four volumes. Snoop Doggy Dog, obviously, in the classic what's my name? Yes. XFM 104.9. We've done that. So that's good. We've done. So we've solved the whole transisticism issue. Yeah. Let me just check. We've done hairy Chinese kids, people having their knobs cut off. I think we've touched on the war as well. We've sort of done that. We've done freaks, haven't we? We've done freak with no arms and legs, haven't we? Take that. Other areas of possible fence. Have we done. Have we done Forrest Gump in a wheelie bin? We touched on your Auntie Nora, but haven't mentioned her. Five. Five minutes. Or her showing you her. Let me see. I think. I don't know if we've. I think we might have. I definitely like to hear the word clunge more often. Yeah. On this show, Mary. I'm still none the wiser on that, but we'll leave it. I love the fact you are such a sort of. You're such an old man, aren't you? Such a reactionary old man. The way you talk. You are the sort of bloke I imagine you and your father stood in a pub if a man came in. In a dress. Oi, you're a bloke in a dress. Take it off. Last week we were talking about things that you can sort of say and do when you're sort of like 40. I thought another one. Nod to a policeman. Yep, definitely. They're on the beat, they're going along. You're going your journey. Yeah, yeah. I know you're all right. I know you're all right. Never mind these youngsters shouting at you and knocking your cap off. Exactly that. You can nod if you're 40. You can nod at copper. Because it's like going, I know what you're up to. It's a difficult job. You're doing it well. Yeah. I respect you now. I didn't when I was younger than I was thinking of. Well done, mate. Well, I like the one you mentioned last week. You're now of an age where a van driver might ask you to back him into a parking space. Yeah. You don't feel good, you go, get out of the way. He wouldn't even consider. No, get out of the way. Yeah. If you're under 30 you don't. It's like I was thinking today if I was in a pub with my dad and say his mates, and they're all sort of 40 or 50, there is not one of them that would turn to me first with a pint of beer and go, taste that, see if. Is that off? No, they would, they would never consider me. My opinion is the last one they're interested in. Yeah. Is that off? Things you can do over. I think maybe 50, wear a flat cap and not like a prat, you know you're wearing. Yeah, exactly. Your elephants cold. You're 50 years old, flat cap, fine. Yeah. Or just wear a suit and tie without having to go to an event or a con or a convention or. Get up and pop on a little old suit and tie. I tell you what, I love seeing old boys in a suit on Sunday. Do you know what I mean? They've got shiny shoes and they're 75, I've got plenty of. And they go down the pub and I think it's brilliant. I got photographs of one of my late grandfathers, he must have been in his 60s, on the beach, wearing a suit. Wearing a suit on the beach. I think I got a feeling he's even got a knotted handkerchief and a full three piece suit. That's great. It's brilliant. It's a decent suit. My grandfather, in my mind, my grandfather was always wearing a suit. I think he wore a suit to bed. I can't imagine taking that suit off. I just, it was always. Maybe it was an all in one pull on one, but he didn't. I mean, what the weird thing is though, it wasn't like he worked in a bank all his life. I think he was a builder. And then he retired and thought, it's time I should start wearing a suit. I know. Oh, I love it. I just, you know, I mean, it's because they've got to do something then they've got to get up and they make an effort and they're, you know, they're still part of the world as opposed to me already just walking around in my pants. Yeah. I mean it's like there's no point in getting dressed. I'm not going out. Yeah. Or everything's got an elasticated waistband. Yeah. Yeah. You don't even consider a pair of trousers. Slip on shoes, pull on trousers. Just. Yeah. I have never seen a man with more Velcro in his closet. That has got to be for you the best time saving device ever. Velcro. It's great. Just. Just me and a baby girl. A dry white baby. I went to Tuxedo, got Velcro. Well, I was still talking about that. The award show. I went home. When did we stay there? We went to what, 12 or so. Anyway, I went home and I was watching 10 at the end, right? And I was eating. I had these sesame seeds. I was hungry, a few. And in the end, at the bottom of the bottom of this jar of sesame seeds, right, or there's tiny little seeds, but I didn't want to waste them, so I sort of poured them into a mouth and sort of like. I'm like mel. It like a. Like a budgie binge. I went to bed, got up the next day, I thought, oh, I felt a bit sweaty. I had a. Had a resolve. And there was loads of seeds still in my chest. Yeah, it took me ages to pick them out before I had a bath. So they must have stayed there all night. But not with the, you know, with the. With the cheese and alcohol that was coming through my pores. These seeds I started growing. I'd have to mow my chest. Oh, dear. Your girlfriend's a lucky, lucky woman. Sesame seed chest. What we got, Carl? Oh, do you remember? We were also talking about names you cannot call kids now. It's like they're a. Exactly. There's great old blokes names, but they have to be a baby once. Yeah, but I name this child Alf. You can't stand. There are sort of these names which you just never name a child now. I mean, Carl, frankly, is quite trendy. Alf, Sid. You would never name a child Sid. Stan, Stan, Bert. I name this child Bert. Did I ever tell you about my. My uncle Alf? No, he wasn't. Wasn't a proper uncle. Right. But it was just one of me, one of my dad's mates and he was getting on a bit. He must have been about, you know, 60, which is pretty old when you're younger than that. And he was the same. He. He used to always wear a suit and that, but he was never. It was never in good nick. It was always like a rough suit. But it doesn't matter still, you know, making half the effort and that. Yeah. And he used to sleep in a dinghy night in clout. What, in his house? Yeah. Why? Well, in a flat, he's in like a little bed set because he only had a little bed set and he was into boats and stuff. So he had these two birds with one stone, had this little dinghy, had a little flat, thought, well, it's tight space and that he had a dinghy as a bed and he had two tellies. Two tellies. One that the sound worked on, the other one only the vision worked. So if you wanted to watch a. Program, had to turn both on, put. Them both on, like BBC one, turned one up and watched the other one. Wow, that's extraordinary. From his dinghy. Sat in his dinghy. That is brilliant. It was an inflatable thingy. It was like a wooden. Yeah, an inflatable one. Yeah. Did you ever go around and visit him? Yeah, now and again. Was it weird seeing a bloke, a six year old bloke in a suit in a dinghy inside watching two tellies? It's weird out the time, I thought I just. Which of the TVs stopped working properly first? I mean, did he. Let's say the sound went on one of them. Yeah. Did he carry on watching the other one, hoping that the other one was fine? He went and got a new telly and then the vision went on that and he went, oh, no. He went, hold on. Then wait a minute, I've got another telly in the wardrobe that I don't usually. Because that's. It must have been like that. Wow, he sounds brilliant. Is he still alive? Yeah, he's still around. Yeah. We've seen for years. But he used to. Was he married? I think that's what happened. I think his. His wife passed away and that's when he had all this, you know, he had a boat and it's like, oh, well, we're gonna put it in a bed, sit. And it was like, hang on a minute. Yeah, I mean sleep in that. So. Yeah. I wonder if you ever brought any women back. Just the idea of bringing back. Getting down to it. Should we move into the bedroom? Ahoy. Oh, that is fantastic. Missy Elliot gossip folks on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkerton. Now, I know we're not meant to mention the adverts and I'm not, I'm not slagging off the advert. Is that. Is that National Lottery advert with a little Welsh fella saying, your money from the National Lottery goes towards mountain rescue and putting out there. We've saved a lot of people now. That's fine, that's great. Well done. What I'm annoyed at is why those people are allowed to go up the mountain in the first place. Yeah. Don't go up there, it's dangerous. You're at your own risk. Yeah. Do you know what I mean, definitely, it's. It's ridiculous. Just posh beardy twats climbing mountains and sticking a flag up. Why Club? I don't want you to. I don't want you to. Am I paying? Is there any point, Rick, where I am paying for people to get rescued from mountains? I'm not sure. I think the lottery's doing it now. Fine. Because I'll tell you, if it was my money, I would be living. Well, that's the point, isn't it? I mean, you should have to take out insurance. If you want to climb up a. Mountain, you should pay for it. If we save you, it'll cost a lot of money. You owe you. I'll be paying it back for the rest of your life. That's the risk. Not falling to your death, exactly, but never being able to pay. They're all posh and rich anyway. But it's just like a cat gets stuck up a tree and the farmer come out because it doesn't know any better. Imagine that was a bloke. I'm stuck up again. Stop going up there. But that's what I'm saying again, though, it's only a cat. So leave it up there, get another one. And there's the skeleton of Tiddles. I couldn't be bothered to go and get a ladder. Nobody's the same. A few weeks ago, everyone was making a fuss over that, that sheep. That was the first clone sheep and it died. Clone another one. Oh, wow. If only you could do the same with mountaineers. Yeah. Oh, it looks the same. The beard's the same. They all look like Brian Blessed. Yeah, exactly. Do I ever tell you about the time that my father, when I was younger, we went on holiday, My dad had. He bought a little boat, little sort of wooden boat, make a three seater, and he and a friend of his went out with me in the boat, I was maybe 12 or 13, went. And we sort of. We were on the. We were the little motor, outboard motor, chugging out. We just thought. We thought this was real seafaring stuff. We sort of. We'd lost sight of the beach because we'd gone round the corner of like a mountain, like a. What you call, like a cliff. And so we're just around the corner and there's this boy just floating in the water. Not a boy, but, you know, like a boy. And very tricky to explain that on the radio. It's the same word, isn't it? Boy. The boy and a boy. Yeah. Yeah. And so we float past that and we're just chugging along. The motor conks out. I can't believe it. We have to row back in. So they're rowing away. I'm just sat there. And we noticed that every time we sort of think we've got past this buoy, it just seems to be back where it started again. We realized that the tide is taking us but not taking us out, taking us towards these rocks. And he was called Ravaged Rocks. And we were a bit pretty scared because I can't swim very well. I couldn't at the time. I think my dad had baby bought, you know. He didn't. I'll be honest with you, I inherited a lot of things from him. One of which was his carefulness with money. Just, just the one life jacket. How deep was the water, which I. Seem to remember he tore off my back and put on himself. So the water is pretty darling, you know. I'm not saying we would have necessarily died, but it was pretty scary because the boat, you know, we were going to crash to these rocks and stuff. It was getting pretty unnerving. And so we're sort of rowing like mad, trying to get. We're not making any progress and we're beginning to think that this might be the end. And this boat, this kind of ferry boat comes chugging by, doing tours and it comes by and my dad goes, oh wow. We were going, brilliant, brilliant. They can help us. They'll throw us a rope, they'll tow us back in. He was going, you've got to be careful though. Hang on. Because according to the laws of the sea, if he rescues us, Steve, he can. Can claim my boat. The laws of the seamen. You can claim my boat. That's like a reward. Do that. What I like is his 12 year old son might die. He's thinking about the boat. I know. But also the other thing, of course is that I like the idea of this ferry master going, ARR, the boat be mine or take your son. Let me think about it. I need a new bed. That'll be just right. King size. Oh dear, that's lovely. So we've, we've done done a lot of stuff today. We've covered minj. We've done. I don't know what else we've done. We've done chop your bollocks off for free. Yeah. We've done the, the operations of fire ground, which I'm not happy about. Yeah, leave the cat up there, spend money. We've done most stuff. I think we've done a lot. We still haven't done Forest Gump in a wheelie bin. But we can. We can leave that till next week if you want. See, I still think there's something in the spending money in areas that it's not needed. Well, you know, the fella, if you haven't. You know, if you've only just tuned in, you've missed a debate about a fellow who needs his tackle taken off. A debate makes it sound like it was a bit more informed than it actually was. And I'm just, you know, all that time, that was probably half an hour ago, I've still been thinking about other things, that it would be good if more money could be plowed into things to get them out there. Like what? I mean, well, I was. I was looking. You know, I'm a fan of going on the web and that. Sure. And there's inventions, right. We were talking about a few weeks ago, inventions that. That are out there. And there's some that, you know, are well known by famous people who have brought stuff out. Do you know why we didn't go on with this? Because I remember saying to you about Einstein, whose clues thinks clever. You won't press for it. I said, Einstein. And you went, this is a quote. You went, einstein. Well, yeah. Now, I've never needed. You got it wrong. You went, I've never needed MC Squared in my life. But the fella who made the video recorder, I watch one a week. Right. Brilliant. And it's the fact that everybody's got one good idea in them. Yeah, Right. Like Newton said about the. The apple. I did Rock Busters. Yeah. Yeah. And there was this thing. There was this thing that was on the website. So they shouldn't be spending money on investigating sort of medical procedures that might help people. They should be spending it on what, Carl? Well, I found this thing, right, Ricky. Brilliant. Yeah. What? It was little sort of mops. Little mops, like little mop heads. Like floor mops. Yeah. Right. Fit them on your cat feet. If you've got a cat. Right. If you've got a little cat, put these little things on, on the feet. And there was a picture of one just like walking around the kitchen, looking a bit like that. You can't do looking like that on the radio. Well, it's just. Just looking a bit sort of fed up. But he didn't really know what was going on. Walking around, you see, like the. The woman of the house sat in the background having a cup of tea. The cat's there walking about on the. On the kitchen lino mopping. The floor. That's what I put my money into. Can we get shares in this? That's an invention. How good is that? Can we get shares in that? It's good though. In it. I'll tell you what, I market that. Oh yeah, that's amazing. I just like the idea of people struggling with their cat to get. Hold on though, wait a minute. What if I had a bad kidney? Ah, well then it's worth paying five. Grand I suppose a year because it cost a cleaner that, wouldn't it? Yeah. So that's. That's what I'm saying. I mean there's loads of other things out there that gets loads of crazy. You can stick a brush in its head and make it go down the toilet. It'll be genius, Carl. No, but there's load. You see, you say that if Newton came up with it, you'd be loving it and there'd be loads of them out there and everything. Right. Imagine Newton coming up with that. Imagine Newton coming up with that. Carl, think of it. Well, there's other things that gets loads of praise. Penicillin, everyone who came up with that. Fleming was it. Yeah. So discovered it on a. Right. I'm 30, don't think I've ever used it. But Neurofenombenalin. Right. So there's one thing what somebody else was talking to you about. Oh God, you like video. Okay, so video telescope was another thing you seem to think is important. Well, no, you asked me about great inventors, so I said Alexander Graham, Bau, the telephone, everything from that link from that John Loki, Baird television, Marconi the radio. I said Galileo. I was naming your stuff. It wasn't that. I was just saying that I think those things are more important than Rockbusters. I think they're better ideas. Telescope, even telescope. Carl, play a record because there's a website. I must try and find it during this record. It's got loads of inventions. I think you're gonna love it. Vicious from new reeds, always a joy. Yeah. Xfm 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Carl, I. Someone pointed me in the direction of this website and I it basically. I swear to God these are real inventions. Okay. That real inventors have applied for patents for, you know, so that they. They own the copyright. Why don't I come up with with one? A real one. Yeah, and then you do that. I think some of this car has to vote on which thinks the better invention. I think some of these card you are going to be Absolutely excited. But if you love the little mops that go on cat's feet, I think. Okay, I'll throw one up to start with. Have you got one there? Ready? Yeah. The X ray machine. All right. Oh, so we've got the X ray machine. Machine, Carl, think of that. So you've come to me. It goes through a painting, so it doesn't need light, it excites it. Well, we know you know what an. X ray machine is, right? I'm sort of head of some business. I've got a load of money. Yeah. You're coming to me with an idea. Yeah, and Steve's coming with me to an idea. I've got say five grand and I've got. I've come with you. I said, look, I can do transvector operations. You go, I'm not interested. I've said my cat needs a kidney operation. You go, I'm not interested. Right, I've come with you with an X ray. Meanwhile, Steve walks in with. Well, firstly, I'm going to offer you. This is Peyton, 557-1247. You've got the X ray machine. I'm going to come to you with the self containing enclosure for protection from killer bees. Tell me more. All right. Well, it's like a self containing enclosure for protection from killer bees comprising an enclosure formed of a flexible transparent plastic material basically that will protect us from any killer bees that might be in the area. Useful. Yeah, don't decide yet. Okay, I'll come up with another one. Refrigeration. Refrigeration. The combination toy dog and vacuum cleaner. Let me read a bit more. Don't judge yet. A toy dog closely resembling a real dog and having a hollow interior in which is mounted a vacuum cleaner. Having a suction hose which is retractable from the tail end of the dog. This enables vacuuming a dog after a haircut and grooming without causing fear to the dog because it thinks another dog. Sorry, this is a decoy dog. To make the dog not realize it's being vacuumed, thinking it's making a friend. There's a picture of it. Carl, Carl, do you see what we're talking about there? That's a dog that looks. Do you see that? Why, why the cat with the mops is on Steve's side and why sort of X rays, refrigeration, things that are on my side and Newton's and MC squared as you. Can you see the difference in these events? Can you see the, the pattern emerging and the difference? Yeah, but you see, to me, which. Are you impressed by? Are you impressed by the sanitary appliance for birds? Have a look at it. It's if you've got domestic bird, maybe a budgerigar or something but you're tired of it crapping everywhere. These are very tiny nappies that go on. A pet is real, isn't it? Pet? Look, there's a picture, there's a diagram. Can I put the microwave up against that one? I know I need the big guns to come out now. Oh, what you thinking? I know you're nappies or the microwave. It's weird because Carl, are you tired of petting your dog or cat? I bet you are. That's why you need this patent pet petter. It is an arm on a piece of wood that will go up and down and stroke and pet your dog for you if you've not got time to do it. Well I can only put up interferon. The cancer cure. I go for that one. Exactly. Yeah. You see a lot of these things. These are all genuine inventions. Yeah. And if the time was right we'd say get a maid. Do you know, I mean if there was a bad swarm in London I'd be saying get the B man on. Yeah, yeah. Right. What Lose, lose the X ray machines. I don't care about broken bones for now. Well at that moment in time that would be more important than. Do you know what I mean? We know people have been stung. We don't need to look inside them. Sure. Do you know, I mean it's all about. It's like the telescope now isn't impressive. Sure. If you want to see something in the distance get on the transport and go and see it. Do you know, I mean you don't need to look at things in the distance. Right. Sure are shitting and pissing all over people's homes. Could we put these. I'll tell you what Carl. So it's looking at supernova and trying to find out more about the universe. It's, it's, it's conception and its eventual end. Forget that Rick, because I've got the. Cheese filtered cigarette now tell me more. This is a cigarette where the filter is actually made from cheese. Apparently cheese acts as a very good filter for tobacco. So the smoke passes through the cheese. Thus you will induce a kind of. Smoky cheese and also smoking, you know, might make you a little bit peckish and you can just nibble that. So there's no dog end lying around. Pavement or budgie shit. It's a cleaner place and you haven't been Stung. Brilliant. Right, now listen. So that's that done. Yeah, we've done that as well. Yeah. We're running out of time. We've got like five minutes left. Winner. Four songs of phrase give us the answers. Right, this. We did this at the start. We haven't even got time for the film thing today. Oh, but we'll do that next week. Songs of phrase. It was a phrase. You never see an old man eating a twips. I love the fact that we go, we haven't got time. Like it's, it's. We've had such important stuff and it's been so jam packed and interesting. Not that it's been drivel with gaps we could have filled. Much better. Yeah, don't look at it like that. Like what? With his film quiz. Come on. Oh, dear. Song's a phrase. You never see an old man eating. The Twix. We had to change it to Mars Bar. Here's. Here's what we had. Jerry and the Pacemakers, Econ, the Bunny Man. David Bowie. David Bowie and the Beach Boys finished. Oh, what do you mean? I thought that almost. What do you mean?
