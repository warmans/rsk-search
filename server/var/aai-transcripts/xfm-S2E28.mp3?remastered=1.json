  "text": "Well, here we are again. XFM on a Saturday, just gone one o' clock, Steve, if I'm very much mistaken, but we're not here as such. We're away again, gallivanting around. We've got to do the special sort of best of again. Okay. Which we did a few weeks ago. So this is the best of the last three weeks, which I think is. I mean, I think it's the best three weeks we've ever had. But I'd like it condensed into two hours. Yeah, yeah. Some great music as well in there. Yeah, there'd be some great music interspersed with. With fine chat that you've already heard. Yeah. Except this bit. This bit's new. We've actually, out of the kindness of our heart, we've come in. We've come in last week. Yep, yep. And we've done a few clips just because we felt a bit guilty about shooting off. Yeah. I mean, even now, having heard this link, I'm beginning to wonder if it was worth our time. Oh, dear. I've said in the past to you, Rick, that my grandparents, so I love them dearly, but it's like for the last 30 years they've been waiting to die. I know. It's like they just sort of. It's like, you know, the novelty wore. Off of, like in the 50s. Got kind of bored of it, like. Yeah. In the forties, it was brilliant. All sat around the old Joanna's, the bombs. The 50s, you know, that was great as well, because that was the post war years. It was, you know, it was a bit tight in the pocket, but it was all right. Everyone pulled together. Then the 60s came along, all the crazy music, the funny hair. Let's stay in bed. And they basically stayed in bed. And it was one Christmas when my. My grandmother said to my dad, what do you like for Christmas? What do you fancy for Christmas? And this must have been, I don't know, 20 years ago. She said, what do you. What do you fancy for Christmas, Ron? And he went, well, you know, I could do with a nice big kind of warm winter overcoat. She said, don't worry about that. Don't worry about that because your father will be dead soon. It's what you can have is meaning my granddad. My feelings with you. My father's still waiting, which is good news. Good news for my grandfather. That's good news for my dad. Freezing. How is he today? He's fine. Okay. Oh, I'm freezing. It is such a weird mindset that I think it's that to Me is what sums up people from that older generation, the 40s and 50s. And it seems to me that you've got that kind of mindset. It's like you were born in the 30s. Whenever you talk of your childhood, it's like you had, like a baked potato to take school. The other thing is, I think that that sort of generation. It seems that the man is dependent on the woman. There's a total dependence. Oh, absolutely. If. If she dies, he's done. Yes, he's done for it. It just pine away if he dies. She's got 30 years of pottering. Absolutely. You know what I mean? And going to, like, you know, the youth club and. Yeah, it's sort of like that. It's sad. Of course. It's sad for them, but it's not the end of their life. No. And it sort of is the other way around. I don't know why that is. Yeah, it's terrible. That's a little melancholy thought for. I know I've really bought. You brought it down. You've brought it down. I've. This isn't a nice show at all. This is terrible. We're gonna have people just killing themselves. What? Well, I didn't really want to make it a Christmassy type show because I don't. You don't really like it. Oh, he's done it again. Well, he did Christmas once. Didn't like it. No. My dad always said, oh, it's Steady on. That's her. Christmas morning was for, like, you know, for me. So he used to stay in bed, so, you know, he never. That's brilliant. That's a great thing. Designed it. Yeah. Yeah. Christmas mornings for you. Run wild, do what you want, just don't bother me. I'm going to Honolulu for two weeks. That's great. Dad, it's Christmas. Do I have to do anything? No. So my mum used to get up because she used to like to see me face light up, you know, when I opened my presents and then fireworks. And then I'd have to go to my bedroom from about six o' clock onwards because, like, my mum and dad were into having big Christmas parties and I wasn't, like, old enough to go, right. So they'd say, right, you know, you've had your fun there. You go up to your bedroom, stay in there. Really? Yeah. I remember one year, right, I got. Got a train set. That's what I wanted. Yeah, right. It's brilliant playing with it all day. I thought, I don't mind about the party. I'm happy Staying up here, playing with this brother comes in, he's had a few, right. He's going, yeah, I'll give us a go. How old is he? He's. He's a bit older than me, so he. He might have been like, let's see. Well, let me. Let him be 18. Yeah, probably about 18. 19. I was. Well, I had a train set, so I don't know, about 14, something like that. Right. So. So I'm playing on that, loving it and stuff. And then he comes in and goes, oh, gives a go. It turns the transformer up to, like, 14. It went really fast for about five seconds. Broke it and then he went back downstairs. Wow. So Christmas ironing got. Sounds like the Conservative government with British Rail satire. I just thought that there's satire, there's any satirical shows. It doesn't work in any way because the analogy falls down. Apart from there being a train. Think it through, though. British Rail was trains. Yeah. And the government broke the trains in many way. They didn't break them, like, not officially breaking them, but they kind of. It does work. It's perfect. Oh, I'm pretty pleased with that. And I can't. And no one's asked him to be on. Have I gotten his view. It's weird, isn't it? He's strange that you've got a satirical mind. That's as quick as that. Yeah. And he's broke your little train set. So what did you do? I just, like, watched telly and had some sausages. I bet you were happy with that, though, weren't you? Just a bit annoying, though, isn't it, when your main present of the years. Been broke and did it ever get it fixed? No, that was it. That was it. Put away. I'm intrigued why your parents wouldn't let you come and join in the festive fun. Was it, like, really debauched down there? Was it like eggnog everywhere? Well, no, but, I mean, that's fair enough. Six is a little bit early, but I just think, you know, if you're your kid, you know, he had those fun. Put them to bed. Put him to bed at 8, maybe. And he saw on Christmas Day. I thought that was a day for family. Well, not if there's a party going on. I don't have the party on the Christmas Day. Well, that's. That's. That's another option. Yeah. Your parents are weird. Are they a strange breed? Well, I think that was a year, right? I. You're talking about buying presents and stuff. I think I did treat Me man. I didn't buy me dad anything. I think that was, like, when I got a bit older, he used to get me dad something because he wasn't that bothered. Anyway, so got me mum. There was a cheap shop, right? Of course, thank God for that. Called Snips. So I went in there and I thought, let's see what I can get her. And remember Victoria Plummet? I don't think so. Well, it's like a fairy character, right? Right. I mean, Mum's into gnomes and stuff, right? So I thought, right, she must be pleased with you. Victoria Plum. I was thinking, is that one of the neighbors? Is it? Is it like a brandy? Victoria Plum. Victoria Plum. Victoria Plum. Yeah, it's like a little fictional sort of character. Okay, okay. So. So I saw it. I thought, yeah, she'll love that, right? So I did me paper round, saved up for two weeks, right? Got that sorted, went to Snips, bought the Victoria Plum. Next day, I mean, I'm in town with her, right? So I think, ah, I know what I'll do. I said, come in here a minute, right? So we go in and we're looking around and I tested her, right? I went, look at that there. That's all right, innit? And she goes, oh, it's bloody awful. Oh, Carl. Oh, Carl. I just, I, I. Oh, God. So then Christmas Day comes. I said, don't bother opening it. She said, no, no. Why? Oh, no? Why don't you still give it to her? So. Well, it's too late. I'd already bought it. Oh, cool. So she opened it and I was like. And she said, oh, that's nice. I said, why are you saying that? I said the other day. So it's bloody awful. She said, oh, no. I thought you're pointing at something else. Oh, no. So that's why I don't get anyone anything anymore. Oh, God. Play record. Oh, God. Oh. Oh, no. XFM 104.9. We're not here. This next clip is one of my favorite clips. Look, it needs no introduction. Here it is. Something, Something else we're giving away. Go on. The Shining. It's more throwing away, isn't it? Once Again video. Once again, it's on vhs. Just because you buy it out of your own money. Carl, stop being so mean. And I want to watch it tonight because it's one of those films that. So you, you're gonna watch this video and then you're gonna send it to someone as a prize? Yeah, it's one of them films. So what you Just said yes to that without blinking. Oh yeah. You don't think like Les Dennis doesn't have a quick go in the car on Family Fortune. It costs 5. Bowen has a go at those. His ner towel racks. 5.99. Carl. Okay, this is Carl in. In the classic the Shining. And what's the question? Well, we might ask that afterwards. Okay then. Still, still try to write the. The book then. Yes. Good. Funny, someone told me the other day, weird thing about a typewriter. The top row of letters, the longest word you can write is typewriter. Just show you just. That's weird, isn't it? It's just the typewriter being you're not in the mood. You just kind of. You're in one of those grouchy moods again that you get into when you write. I'm not being grouchy. I just want to finish my work. Yeah, it's just she being a bit funny. Bit offhand in that. Let me explain something to you. Go on. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration. You're distracting me and it will then take me time to get back to where I was. Understand? Yeah, but I just was coming in to try and cheer you up, you know, if you. I mean I'm full of ideas as well, you know, if you're having a problem coming up with stuff. Got loads of stuff. Loads of ideas you could write about. The other day I read about this airy Chinese kid. What do you want me to do about it? No, it's just that it could make a good book. Do you know what I mean? Sort of following round. That's swell. Well, I'd buy it, you know. But if you don't want to know, won't have to, don't bother doing it. But I mean just airy Chinese kid. It's weird because they're not normally that hairy over there. Yeah, this kid caked in it. But if you don't care. I wouldn't touch one hair on his God damn little head. You don't have to touch any hair on his head. Like I say, he's covered. Leave the head alone. If you want touch his hands, he's totally covered in it. But I love the little son of a bitch. Don't go that far. You haven't met him. But I can sort it out. I do anything for him. I don't think you'd expect that much. Just checking to the barbers three or four times a week. You know, he's a good, good little kid. In fact, I'll do it. I think I'll write a book on him. Yeah? How do you think you can handle that? Yeah. You're not too busy, are you? Well, yeah, I'm pretty busy. I've got to sort out some. Some monkey facts for the show this Saturday, but I reckon I can still. Why don't you start right now and get out of here? All right, I will. You gonna be like that? Couldn't borrow a pen, could I? See you later. There you go. Haunting stuff there. Carl Pilkerton in the Shining. You know, in the film, Jack Nicholson goes crazy because the suggestion is he's maybe possessed by demons that maybe are in the. In the hotel. But you know, if I were stranded in a desolate hotel, removed from all human contact with car, I'd go mental with an axe without being possessed by demons. That's more chilling to me. Trying to get some work done and you keep wandering in. I'm trying to get Carl to spend a couple of days in the caravan with me just for the hell of it. And he won't. I've offered him money. When I think it'd be a great laugh, wouldn't it, Carl? Oh, yeah, great. That would be terrifying. No, I want to film it like a little video diary. There's Carl there. He's just waking up. Well, if I was stranded in that, that would be like being. I may as well be with Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees. That's. That's more scary. The thing is, Ricky doesn't mess you about as much as he messes me about. No, you see, you've given him an inch. You've given him an inch and he's taken a yard. 12:30. You got in today in the 30 minutes between 12:30 and 1. The old bin lid on the head. He wanted to do that again. Yep. Squeezing my head. Think he had a go at. And karate chop on the back of the neck. Yeah. All in 30 minutes. Who else can say that? Xfm104.9 Ricky Gervais show with Steve Merchant. Hello there. And we're not here this week. We're off jetting around the world. So we've pre recorded these links. The time is currently somewhere between 1 and 3 o' clock. So time check there from Steve Merchant. No problem. Yeah. And. Oh, what. What about this weather? Isn't it warm stroke. Edit that, Carl. Cold. Okay, whichever one. I'm pleased to see that the congestion charge has had some considerable effect. Had no effect. So just. Yeah. Oh, wasn't that Great. On telly last night, the film. Yeah. I particularly enjoyed last night's EastEnders. Coronation Street, Brookside. Okay. Yeah. Oh, those boys can rock there. That's the guns with all their roses and Sweet Child of mine on XFM 104.9. I enjoyed that. Yeah, that was good. It rocks. I hope. I hope the audience is playing it loud like us. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Steve Merchant, Carl Pilton. Well, look at him yawning. How rude is that? Carl, what's wrong with you, man? Have you been up late? A little bit. Girlfriend was away, wasn't she, yesterday? Yeah, I always have a problem with that. I always have. Because you don't go to bed, do you? Early. Do you know what I mean? You sort of think, I just always find that thing that if, you know, used to living with someone. Yeah. One of you will go, let's go to bed. Then you'll go, all right. But when you're on your own, you go. You just forget to go to bed. Okay, stop. Stop eating now, Carl. You've had all the food. That's just a plate. All right, Okay. I just. I stayed up and watched. There was a thing on about Dracula, right? What Dracula? And I found a floor in it. Go on. Not. Not the fact that is the living dead and is. No, it drinks blood to stay alive. And he doesn't reflect. And he continues well. And you can go on the mirror thing. He can't look in mirrors, can he? Well, he can look in mirrors, but he can't see himself in a mirror. That still doesn't work. It doesn't work at all, Carl. It doesn't work at all. Center parting's always really neat. His center parting's always neat. How does he do it if he can't look in the mirror? Blood on the floor or something. It was called rubbish. I love. The flaw in the Dracula film is that it's center part, it's too neat. How did he do it without a mirror? Ah. Was it a documentary about Dracula? No, the real Dracula. Yeah, the real Dracula film. Blood on the Floor or something. It's called. Yeah, we had a little lunch yesterday, didn't we? We did indeed. That was a nightmare. Yeah. I hate going out with you, too. I was explaining to Carl, right? I like to excite Carl's imagination, right? And if it involves chimps or monkeys, all the better. Brains, he likes parts of the body deformity, you know. I know. I know where to, you know, what buttons to push. And I told him about this thing. I don't Know if any of you out there know about this, but there's an experiment they did in the 50s, a clinical psychology experiment where there's two hemispheres of the brain, okay? They're joined by a thing called the corpus callosum, right, which is just a little flap of skin, like a little scart lead that joins your two hemispheres. And what they did, they cut that in half. And I thought it was a cure for schizophrenia, but what it turned out to be, or epilepsy, I think, I can't remember, was that you have two sides. Your brains didn't function together, you couldn't get information. I was telling Carl this thing. One of the things I told him was that they did it on a monkey and it fought itself over a nut. Like its right arm was connected, you know, by its left lobe of the brain and it was fighting over itself. And Carl went. Instead of like thinking, this is amazing experiment, he went, would it, Would it have been happy if you'd given it two nuts? Yeah, I know. Well, you started off by explaining it. I remember you mentioned. Because I was watching the two of you as you were describing to me, you said, of course, one side of the brain deals with symbolism. And as you said the word symbolism, I noticed Carl drift away from looking at you, pick up his mobile phone and start pressing buttons randomly. And I thought it was the word symbolism that got him. And I noticed it took you just a moment longer. And I think the first thing you say was, when did I lose you? Yeah, I know I'd lost him. It's extraordinary. And he doesn't even try to dig. A scope at one point as well, right. And I knew I was dicing with death there, but I thought you tried to look it up, didn't you, on the, on the web. You didn't find anything about it spelling. The spelling of it's. What, what is it again? What's the word? Corpus callosum. Yeah, I can't do it. No, don't bother. Give up. Don't bother. So if anyone knows any interesting facts about that. Yours hasn't been cut in half, has it, Carl? That would again, won't explain something. I'll tell you what we will be talking about later. I don't know if you, if you're sort of aware of them, Steve, go on. Bonobos. Oh, I don't know much about bonobos. I told him about them. He was looking for stuff. I said, put in bonobo. He was having no luck with chimp. And they're, they're, they're a form of chimpanzee, but they're even closer to us, evolutionary speaking. They've got. Their social groups are more like ours, they're more intelligent and he was loving it, weren't you? So is it human bonobo Carl? Is that how it works on the evolutionary lab? Chimp Carl? Yeah, yeah. So we're talking about bonobos. You're excited about that. So, coming up in Monkey News. No, I think it's a bit of a monkey bonus. Oh, that was great. That was very, very funny. What a wonderful clip that was. I enjoyed. Do you remember that? I. Yeah, yeah. Wow. A few weeks ago, wasn't it, really? I mean, I think it was last week. We'd have very, very bad memories not to remember that hilarious clip. I'd like to hear that again, maybe in a couple of weeks time when I'm away. Yes, absolutely. It's. It's embarrassing, isn't it? And we, you know. But, you know, the good thing is, on telly, I feel a bit guilty about putting out shoddy rubbish because I'm getting paid an awful lot. Yes. But here, you know, I. I don't give a. They can bleep that. They will do. They will do. Better. David Bowie. When's that ever anyone, Steve? Never. Lady Stardust off Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars on XFM. 104.9. I'm looking Gervais. Steve Merchant. Carl Pilkington is in the middle of educating me colon. Then educate me. Did I tell you the time when the doctor said I was gonna die? All right, keep talking. Right. Ages ago. Must have been about 15. Right. And at lunchtime there was this. We used to have a choice of stuff to do at lunchtime, right? Used to have like a. Like a burger place that had an arcade machine in it, right. So we used to go there and play on that and have a burger. Or there was this baker's, right, that my mum worked at and did great cakes and stuff, right? So she used to, like, bring some home and that, but she couldn't always bring them home every night because, you know, it cost money and she used to get them for free and they used to say they'd rather chuck them away than give them to the staff because there's a chance that the cream might be off. Right? Right. So they used to chuck them around the back. So I used to go around the back with me mate and eat alone. Brilliant. Scavenger eating out of bins. No, it was really. It wasn't out of Bins, they were still in trays, but they just stacked them up near the bins. Right, so this got out. I mean, it used to be chocker. Once the school found out, everybody used to go there and it'd be like, well, have a cake. Fighting the kids off, right? So I'd have, you know, you just eat, I don't know, six jam donuts or something, and then you'd spend your dinner money on the arcade machine. Brilliant. Right, so it was a good, good afternoon, really. Right, so you do that. And this one day, I must have had six or seven jam doughnuts, Few congress tarts. What's the congress tarts? Just, I love them, it's me. I can't get them in London, right? So. If anyone can get a congress tart for Carl in London, please let him know. So anyway, this day, that was just a normal day, do you know what I mean? You'd once, twice a week, you'd have a load of cake in your life. Yeah, yeah. With the frog boys there with it, with the web tans and the big heads and the horse in the city. Yeah. But the day after, one of these days, they had really bad cramp in my belly. I was like in agony, could hardly walk. So I said to my mum, hardly staggered to the free cakes, so I was in absolute agony. I said, I think I don't like doctors, but you have to get a doctor in because I don't know what it is, I can't walk. She gets the doctor around. I won't say his name, but he said. He said, well, doesn't look like he's got long left. Blimey. So I was a bit like, hang on a minute, I've only had a few cream donuts. Yeah, My man was panicking, sure. He went, My dad came in from work, she said, oh, something's really bad. We can't think it's serious, you know, the doctors only ain't got long left. So he said what? He said that and just left. So she said, yeah, so I'll have to call him, then. So he called him up, said, what's all this about? You know, Carl hasn't got long left. How long's he got? So he goes, oh, I was only messing. He just got. Just had some bad cream. Can you believe that? Well, the thing is, I like the. Fact your mum didn't ask any questions. Can you explain more, Doctor? No, I got a shoe off, but. She doesn't, you know, I don't want to diss you or your family. But I imagine if I was there, I'd have known the doctor was joking. That's all I'm saying. I mean, I. I sound very arrogant there, but I imagine he went, what's he doing? I had about six cream girls. All right. Oh, wow. He hasn't got long to live then. I'll see you later. That's what I think the doctor did. Yeah. Your mum just let him go. Yeah. Terrified, thinking, well, I'm not gonna probe him. He's. That's it. Then dad comes in, Hi, honey, I'm home. Anything happened? That doctor said Carl's gonna die and then left. Did he? I'll call him. But anyway, that's why these sort of things fascinate me. So we'll move on to this next one, Right. Which is brilliant short story. So, right, old woman, about 70 years old. She's normally fit and healthy and stuff. Nothing wrong with her. She's having a good life. And one day she goes for a check to the doctors, just to check herself out because she's getting on a bit. Yeah. Says, take your clothes off and that. So she does and checks her out, says, yeah, you're looking good, you're looking good. Turn around. He said, oh, God. He says, you got a tumor on your buttock. Right. So she goes, oh, what can you do? Anything to sort out. So they go, yeah, yeah, yeah. We could book you in for an operation. It's best if we remove this. Books are in for an operation. Operation. Day comes, stripper down and that they're all stood round, the doctors start to operate. It only turns out it's a pork chop that she sat on five years earlier and it had stuck to her buttock. Right, Carl. Okay, Carl, I'm telling you now, I'm leaving. I'm never, never doing this show again. No, I'm ser. Honestly talking. I've never any such. What do you mean, you couldn't believe it? No. When I read it, I said, I've got to tell Ricky. This woman had a pork chop stuck to her ass for five years. You mental case. Of course she didn't. That is a blinding record. And before that, Rick, what do you make of those adverts? They were great, weren't they? I like them. Yeah. I'm going to buy all them products on the way home. And that's endorsed by Ricky Gervais. He's won awards. Yeah. Rick, do you remember this? This was a hilarious. No, no. You remember this when you heard it? It was when Carl said something that was basically, I think For a lot of people it sounded like a lot of old bollocks. What have we got now? Right, so we, we're looking into animals that we get rid of. I've spoken to someone about snails, I've spoke to someone about jellyfish and that and looking at cockroaches today. She's an expert, she's just not. Not just some random place. No, she works in a museum. Well, a good museum. I said I'd give it a plug. It's a one there, Knights Bridge. It's got dinosaurs and that in it. It's worth seeing. And that's the museum. Yeah. So it's not sure. He's not sure. This is what happened. Now what I'll do, I'll tell you as much as I know and then you can fill me in if I'm right or wrong and then at the end of it we'll get to the bottom of whether we need them or not. Okay? All right, so first of all, the first thing that I found out is that they have 18 knees. That's not exactly possible. They're insects. So they have six legs. Yeah. And a knee is usually the junction between femur and tibia. That sort of classic human knee isn't every other animal knee. So with six legs you can only have six knees. Could somebody sort of got mistaken for seeing one that was a bit double jointed? I think you're grasping at straws or something. All right, well we might have to come back to that one then. They can hold the breath for 40 minutes. Well, they don't do that because they don't breathe in the same way as us. They breathe through little spiracles, holes down the side of the body. So no, they're not a very apt simile because the method of breathing is so different. What do you mean? Because insects have a totally different system. They don't have lungs in the way that we do, just breathing through one part of the body. They're actually breathing through every segment of the body all of the time. So even though they've got their mouth shut, they might be able to slide. Nothing to do with breathing. So just so you see, maybe that's where someone's gone wrong. Someone's got hold of one and sort of taped its mouth up or something and got bored after 40 minutes and said, well we'll call it that unkind. Thing to do to an insect, even to a cockroach. Yeah, but it's all. You can't do that. Yeah, but pretty unkind thing to do. Anything to anything, even a cockroach. Something else I found out they can live for a week without an head. Well, that's true if they don't bleep to death in the process. But the weird thing is, when I told you that they had 18 knees, you seemed a bit sort of like, don't talk ridiculous. But then we're talking about an animal that can live without an head. So there's a little bit of truth in that one. Yeah. Yes. Why, when it was invented, has it got that facility? Say if someone said to humans, we could do that with humans. And, you know, if you lose your head in some accident, it gives you a bit of time to sort of go back to your family and maybe write. Write them a note. You won't be able to have a chat, but write them a note saying, it was my own fault and it was nice knowing you. Well, that would be a useful facility, I agree. But cockroaches are great survivors. I mean, they've been around for over 300 million years. They're one of the most primitive insects. All right. Well, I've also. Is it true that they do a lot of resting? Apparently they can sort of rest for 75% of the time. Rest? Yeah, they just. Just sit about doing nothing. It's probably true of a vast proportion of the world's fauna. I mean, maybe. Maybe the 25% that they are working, they're really giving it some. So it might make it probably searching out food. And, yeah, they can slow down considerably. You can chill insects in the fridge and they'll become very, very quiet. You might think they're dead. Yeah. But I'm sure, you know, if we were sat in a fridge, you know, we'd go a bit quiet, wouldn't we, you know? Well, you might not know much about it, of course. Yeah. But not quite reading the right sources. Well, I've been using the Internet. I'm sure there are many useful sources that you could find there, but some of those seem to have been a little misleading to you, so. So you don't agree with. With a lot of what I've told you there? No. So cockroaches, can we get rid of them? No. So we're keeping them, then? I would say so, yeah. I think we should get her on more often because she sounds like she'd be a bit of an ally, really, because she knew immediately you were talking nonsense. She even said, I think you should be more concerned about your sources, which I've been trying to tell you for a year all Right, the fat. I mean, I'm 18 knees. Where did you get that from? On the Internet. They can hold their breath for 40 minutes. I mean, I don't know what. I don't know what you read and. Take on Mad World on it. But if you've just tuned in sex FM 104.9, you've got that bit right. Ricky Gervais, Shoe with me, Steven Merchant. Hello there. Carl is actually in a little booth. We're not in the studio, See, we're. This is pre recorded. We recorded this last week because we're away and it's sort of like the Best of. Best of the last three weeks since last time we were away when we put out the Best of. Okay, what's the next one? What's the Educating Wiki? I don't know. See, like I say, I was looking around and there's stuff that is interesting. All right, I was looking on the. Web but there's no point. Well, it's just I found one about what's the point? About a lad who, eight years old but he's still breastfed. Now, I don't know if you can get anything out of that. Is that what his mum said? What do you mean? I don't know if I can get anything out of that. You don't need to. No, it's just that you. Where did you read that? That was on the Internet. Oh, well, yeah, you're always unspecific when you mention it. It's just. It was on the Internet. Well, I'm trying to think what I put in. I think I put in Y to see if I'd confuse a computer. Ah, go, you are. No, honestly, I did a search putting Y and he came up with funny things that like, why is this person doing that? Why is that? And it had a picture of this eight year old lad sort of, you know, on his mum's nipple and it was saying, you know, is this healthy? You sure that wasn't asking you that question? What I put in. Why? Just go, what do you mean? Yeah, stop it. Yeah. Oh, look, yeah, Last week I was walking home with him and I went. He was saying something stupid. No, I've got a competition for next week, let's do a phone in. And it's called Carl Pilkington, Genius or fool. Yeah, right. And he went, no, no. I went, why not? He went, well, it'd be confusing because they say there's no difference between genius and being a fool. No, no, but it's rubbish. And people say there's a fine line between madness and genius. And, you know, it's a ridiculous sound bite. They don't say there's a fine line between a genius and an idiot. Well, the people who do are idiots. Yeah. So what would you do there, though? Just to sort of wrap that little thing up. What would you do? That lad loves his mum's. His mum's milk. What are you talking. What are you asking me to come up with? No, I'm just title for the story. No, no, no, no. It's just, it's just what would you do? Right, what do you mean, what would I do? Well, it's causing a bit of a problem in the area. What area? In America, I think it was. Oh, America, a problem, are they? George Bush is worried about this kid who's breastfeeding 8. Imagine it like this, right? Right. So, Carl, what are you asking me about this spurious story you saw on the Internet. I saw on the Internet, there's an 8 year old lad who likes his mum's milk and it's saying, is this right? Should it? No, it's not. But what, what do you want Ricky to do about it? It's not his responsibility. Yeah, yeah, but, but the little town that he lives in, they're all causing an uproar, right? Going, this isn't right, you know, I can' Your kid play out in case he's in the garden with his mum getting a bit hungry. Right, so what should they do? Because his mum's saying, well, he likes it. Yeah. And he, you know what, so what do you do? I don't know. The laws. No, but I'm not asking you to sort out the laws. I'm just saying if you lived in that neighborhood, what would you say? If you went up to him and said, look, everyone's getting a bit fed up with this. Look. What, what, what would I do? What do you mean what would I do? What are you asking me? Right, it doesn't matter. No, no, no, no. What are you asking me? What are you asking me? And Steve and the public saying, if. You live next door to this woman. Yeah, right, the kid's hungry, 8 years old, he's out playing on his bike and he goes, ma' am, I'm getting a bit peckish. And he goes, all right, son. She whoops one out and he starts having his. Having his milk, right? You live, you live next door, you're putting your washing out and you see this going on. You're getting a bit sick of it because it's gone for Months, Eight years. Why is it your business? Why are you. Why are you such a nosy neighbor that you're concerned? What would you do, Carl? Let's turn it back on him. What would you do? What's your solution? What would you do? Well, I thought I'd say, right, why are you doing this? And she'd say, because he likes it. And I go, all right, then. Put it in a bowl first. And you think that would sort that out? No, because I was thinking about the whole thing. Right. And you do that when you're a baby and everything's all right, innit? Yeah. No one bats an eyelid. That's a little baby having a bit of milk from its mum's breast, Right? Yeah. You'd almost say it was natural, but. You grow out of it. It's like you don't see it got me thinking about things you don't see and you don't see. Did you put this into a computer? Show me things you don't see. What else don't you see? Well, you don't see. Like an old man having a Twix. You never. Oh, so what? You know. You know the terrible thing about all this, Steve, is he's right. You don't see a lot. No, I know. That's a terrible thing. So what they have got, right, They've made old man toffees, haven't they? They've come up with words. Old man toffees. Is that a song? Oh. Oh, God. You don't see that. So they've got their Werthers, right? Ye. Look at him. You think he's giving a lecture at Oxford. No, he's not coming anyway. No, go on. Sorry. Go on. I'm just saying you grow out of things. Yeah. And the old man, I'm sure when he was a kid, he'd have a Twix. Yeah. Now, it doesn't look right. So he's having. It doesn't look right, so right. I don't think Werther's originals were specially designed for old people. I think they were sweets that just happened to have been made for years. That's why old people eat them. They didn't go, hang on, there's a market here. I've noticed old people aren't eating Twixies. Quick, let's make some old man sweets. But the little advert, he gives it to his grandson as well, doesn't he? Goes, albert Werther's original. It cuts, though, before he throws it back in his face. Get me a twist. XFM. 104.9 we're not here. It is a bit like being Dennis Norden, playing some great, great moments from the show. I just imagine Dennis Norton one day, sort of just like waking up out of his stupor. He's doing this. And he'd go into the producer, go, I've just seen a couple of my programs. I just saw. It'll be right on the night 18. It's. Why didn't someone tell me? Well, we. We didn't want to upset you because, you know. But I've been doing it way too long. Will you just let me calm. Forever? Well, until you died, yeah. Well, why can't my son take over? Well, he's 80, Dennis. And the jokes I'm doing, they're awful. They're just. Why have I got that clipboard? I've written these jokes. They're not funny. There's an audience. They're laughing. What are they laughing? They're not laughing. They're not. They're not laughing. That's cam. Laughter. Who are those? Audience. Who. Who goes to an audience for. It'll be right on the night. A lot of them are older than you. It can't be right. You know, we have 15 fatality in one of your audiences. But I went. I went home at Christmas. I watched one of the episodes. It was with my family and friends. I said, watch this. You'll love it. Stoney face. No one laughed. They all thought it was. Well, it is. Well, why didn't you tell me earlier? We didn't want to hurt your feelings. You're an old man. You may be upward of 102. I didn't realize. Here's a problem that someone's emailed in. We're taking emails today. If you've got a problem, a concern, or, you know, just a general query that you think Carl could answer for you. It could be about anything. It could be about some of the big kind of philosophical questions. It could be something to do with war or famine, anything like that. Or it could just be a personal dilemma, you know, something that's happening locally. Anyway, this seems one that I think you probably have. You and your father have probably come across this sort of dilemma in the past, and I'd be interested to know what your take is on it. Let me see. This is from Lee Matthews, by the look of it. He says he lives in a suburban area where the local teenagers also live on the same road, and they're running riot. They're smashing wing mirrors off the cars. They're crashing into park cars on their skateboards. They're just generally making mayhem, you know, night and day. What can he do to stop this going on? The parents of the kids don't seem to give a damn. Anyone who complains to them, they just say, I'll piss off. You know, the police are useless because they never catch him in the actual act of violence, which is what they got to do to apparently convict them. So they don't know who to turn to, really. When a little old lady went and got the A team, you know, it's a great note. And he was dressed as an elderly Chinaman, she knew he was Colonel Decker. Didn't have a clue. Yeah, you see, it's weird because now. Now it has got out of hand. Sure. I mean, like years ago, when I was growing up on the estate. Yeah, you had problems, but not like you have now. I mean, you know, summers were nice. As well, weren't they? Right. And police are getting shorter. But you yourself kind of admitted in the past that you were something of a tear away, that you didn't do anything like these kids here. The thing is, I was. I was scared that if I got caught doing it, my dad would go mad. Yes. And I remember smashing a car window by accident and legging it in the lounge and sort of pretending to go asleep on the settee. And he heard a knock at the. Door just to be unconscious when his dad came home. And there was a knock on the door and I thought, oh, God, this is a fellow. He saw me. I was chucking a stone in the air, seeing how I could throw it. Did it keep landing on your head? That would explain a lot. It came down. Stone in the air. Love it. You can see how far I could throw. Brilliant. So, you know, I wasn't bothering anyone. Did you invent that game? Did you get the stone for your birthday? Go and play with your stone. He gave one to Suzanne. Carl, go and play with your stone. The thing is, right. And it came down at a funny angle and of course it did. It ate the back of this car. And the back window is the most expensive because it has that heating thing in it. Yeah. In case you got a frosty window. So I thought, oh, God. So I legged it in, got on the settee, went to sleep, knocked out the door. Genius. It's a brilliant plan. It's a brilliant plan. I couldn't be guilty. I'm asleep. So. So I love the idea. So the thing is, our lounge used to sort of. You could. You could see in from the Door. Right. So this family who saw me do it saw me asleep on the settee and my mum said, go and get the door. And I sort of went, what? As if I'd been asleep? Yeah. I went to the door, like, rubbing my eyes, and the fella said, what did you run off for? I saw you. I was like, oh, no. And I didn't see me dad. I went out. It was when he was working, sort of evenings. So I went out so I didn't have to see me dad. And then the next day I came. I came home from school and my dad said, 45 quid. Oh, that's all he said. And then you fell asleep and he went, wake up, wake up. You know what I said? No, 45 quid. Now, the thing he didn't have to do, £45, Carl. Now, I know you were saving up for a brick, but you can't have it. Yeah. Equally if you're doing a bigger crime, you know, a bank job. Yeah. Remember to take the stocking off your head because they wake you up and go, why have you got a stock on our head? Just go, oh, I had a weird dream. Okay, look, quick query for you. This is from Jay. He's got a problem here. He says, my parents won't let me ditch my studies. He's currently reading modern languages at London University. Sure, he wants to follow his dream, but his parents won't let him. Of being a dancer, Carl. Worse than that. He says that they're trying to arrange a marriage to a bunch of minging daughters of people they know from good families. He doesn't know what to do. She's got the arranged marriage coming along and he's also got got. You know, he basically wants to, you know, wants to be a dancer. His parents are forcing him into something more practical. First thing, right? I don't think the arranged marriage thing is such a bad idea, okay. Because I think too many people go on looks, right? And then you soon get bored of that and you find out the person who you're knocking about with, it's actually not your type. Right. Why don't you arrange marriages for people? Well, I'm just saying. Right, so I'd say, Jay, go along with that. I wouldn't worry about it. It. Okay. I mean, if they're really ugly, then, you know, don't go along with it. But if they're half bad, yeah, put up with it. That's right. The dancing. Brilliant. Right, that's that solved. Brilliant. I wanted to be a dancer after I did the Boxing, right. I joined. Joined a dancing thing just near Man United's ground, right. Called Twiggies Along. I wanted to learn some moves. Well, it's when Michael Jackson was like pretty big, so about 80, 83, 84, 85 around there. Wanted to do it. When I went, it was short and I'd become like a warehouse for toilet rolls. So in a way, I wonder what would have happened. Sorry, sorry. How is that an anecdote about you going through dancing? You've told me before. You what? You did boxing for a while. You did dancing for a while. You have two fighting. The boxing you didn't even get in the. That's not enough. Imagine if that was a film. This is a boy's Dreams of becoming a dancer. Oh, it's shut next on. I mean. Yeah. How is that? Yeah, yeah. A brilliant Footloose. All right. Yeah. I'm fed up. They banned it. Let's go. I shut Flash Dance first. There was a warehouse. Never mind. Yeah. I'm just saying, you know, you'll find something else. I think I got a go kart after that I bought a motorized go kart and kept myself busy with that. So there's always other. This thing. Alan Bennett has to sit down and really sweat over his stories. Yeah. He just opens his mouth. You are a living Alan Bennett character. So that's. That's all. Well, Jay, don't worry about that. There's no emotional. There emotional problems I can foresee if you follow that advice. So the advice there is do an arranged marriage. If she's not. If she's not minging. She's not completely minging. Yeah. And don't worry about dancing. Get a go cart. Cheers. This is XFM 104.9 on rookie race with me, Stephen Merchant. You're listening to the Best of of basically Carl Pilkington. You don't talk to anyone, do you, in the week. You just hide in your little sound booth thing and you really don't talk to anyone, do you? Much, not really, no. I mean, you, you know, you might call up. Yeah, but now I keep myself to myself. Yeah. Then you don't get bogged down in the office politics and stuff. Yeah. Is there a lot of office politics here? I don't know. I don't get involved in it. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Proved your point. So. So when we're away and we're like, out of action, other than Suzanne, who will you talk to of the day? How will you get a sort of feedback from the world? How you get sort of like input. And I always, if I've ever, if ever I've got like a question on anything, the Internet sat there and I can just go on online and find out. The Internet is, is good, it's brilliant. But it's not all verified. It's not all factually, necessarily. Factually accurate. Anyone can put things onto the Internet. It's the, you know, that's, it's, it's freaks and things that pot on. Well, there's things like. Here's one that I read in the Week about this woman, yeah, she was a bit of a punk. And to get her hair done, like, she wanted it. Superglue, right? No, she got loud. Apparently it's a popular thing. You might, you might know, put loud on your head. Yeah. And you put it in the oven. Oh. Now apparently the heat that you get from the oven is different from the sort of heat you get from an air dryer. Right. And she had to do that to get the style that she wanted. But anyway, she comes into the money or whatever, treats herself to a microwave, right? It doesn't, it's not true. Opens the door, jams the things, you know, like the little catch. So. So the microwave works. She jams it with a screwdriver or a knife or something. Yeah. Puts the microwave on, sticks her head in, boils a brain. Don't be ridiculous. Right, well, why is that ridiculous? Boils her brain. She boiled her brain. She boiled her brain. And this is what's good about the Internet. I went straight from that and there was a subject about brains. And you know that Russell Crowe, when he dies, is giving his, his brain to charity or something. Some sort of. Some people who can do stuff with it. She gave hers to Pot Noodle. Vesta. Yeah. Oh, boiling a skull. Yeah, that's. That's not true. It's not true, Carl. Just urban myths. They're urban myths, but again, where does it start? They're just too convenient. Urban myths. Everyone said you can tell an urban miss. Not really. Good. Because it's always this happened to a mate of mine. And. And when you say what happened? Then they go, don't know. That was it, was it, was that it? Was it someone? Boulder brain. And that was it. There was no more story. Were there any dates? I think it was in Belgium. There's that, there's that, there's that, there's that one. That a bloke, right, was going to get a phone call at 4 o' clock to find out if his business was, you know. Okay, right. And if if he didn't get the phone call, he knew he was broke, destitute. So dead on, four o' clock, the phone didn't ring, so he went up to the. The roof, his office, and he jumped off to commit suicide. And as he was passing his window, the phone was ringing. Oh, no. Carl, it didn't happen. Think it through. Think it through. Who. Who told that story? Who told that story as he hit the pavement at 120 miles an hour? He's the only person who could have known those. That series of incidents. Also. Why did he wait? As his life's at stake, why didn't he wait till five past? I. So I'll give it five minutes, just in case. In case the lines are busy. Yeah. And this. And what sort of. What sort of bloke goes out? I'll call you at 4, okay? If your business. Well, call me anyway. No, no. If I don't call exactly four, then. No, you could commit suicide. Commit suicide? I would, because if I don't call it four, that's the end of it. Well, call me anyway. No, that's not the way I work. Why can't you just call me and tell me other way? Well, I'm telling you, I would do it if you're bust, I don't call. Can't you just call to verify in case something goes wrong? What if it's engaged? It won't be engaged. Just commit suicide. Four, please. It. It didn't happen. Carl, have you the other one, right, A bloke, right, He's. He's on a train station and I'll say I heard it. He's. He's waiting for a crew station, whatever, and he shits himself, as you do. And so he goes, oh, my. Trains in five minutes. I need. So he runs across to Millets and goes, quick, Levi's 36. The bloke just puts it in a bag. He runs onto the train, he goes into the. The toilet. Takes his trousers and pants off. He's soiled. Yes. Throws them out of the window. I won't be needing those again. Cleans himself off. Open the bags. It's a jacket. Oh, no, it didn't happen. At what point did he go into it? Go, go quick. Levi's 36. And the bloke went, sorry, Levi's 36, what a pair. Oh, shall I wrap them? Them? It. It. Shall I wrap. Just wrap whatever it is. Do you want to look? No, I'm not looking. When you're putting it in the bag, please. Right, 36 white stories. Well, not. Don't say anything. I've told you. 36 Levi's. They put it in a bag and. Charge me for it. Yeah, I don't want to discuss it further. Yeah, there was one. There we go. There's one about a woman whose husband died and she had him cremated. Yeah. And made. Made like a little egg timer out of him and she said I did that so it can still help around the kitchen. Well, that might be true. That might be a joke. That's quite sweet. That might be true. True story again. It was all. No, not again because the ones I just told weren't. Nor is the boiling the brains in a bag curry microwave head story true. Yeah, that's all. I'd like to play a beautiful song now by Cat Stevens called Dilly White. It's. It's lovely. A song for the lovers room. Yeah. Big sales.",

I don't Know if any of you out there know about this, but there's an experiment they did in the 50s, a clinical psychology experiment where there's two hemispheres of the brain, okay? They're joined by a thing called the corpus callosum, right, which is just a little flap of skin, like a little scart lead that joins your two hemispheres. And what they did, they cut that in half. And I thought it was a cure for schizophrenia, but what it turned out to be, or epilepsy, I think, I can't remember, was that you have two sides. Your brains didn't function together, you couldn't get information. I was telling Carl this thing. One of the things I told him was that they did it on a monkey and it fought itself over a nut. Like its right arm was connected, you know, by its left lobe of the brain and it was fighting over itself. And Carl went. Instead of like thinking, this is amazing experiment, he went, would it, Would it have been happy if you'd given it two nuts?",

He says he lives in a suburban area where the local teenagers also live on the same road, and they're running riot. They're smashing wing mirrors off the cars. They're crashing into park cars on their skateboards. They're just generally making mayhem, you know, night and day. What can he do to stop this going on? The parents of the kids don't seem to give a damn. Anyone who complains to them, they just say, I'll piss off. You know, the police are useless because they never catch him in the actual act of violence, which is what they got to do to apparently convict them. So they don't know who to turn to, really.
