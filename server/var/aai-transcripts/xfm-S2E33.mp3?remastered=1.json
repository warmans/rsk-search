  "text": "Foreign hickory dickory docks. Some lads there just wrote a song called Clocks. The lads are Coldplay and the song is Clocks. I'm Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington, pressing the little buttons there. Xfm 104.9. What's that? What's that little. Well, I think I do more than press the buttons. Right. See, this is. This is it. Right. A car was. Had a little strop on since last night. Okay. And he's had a little strop on. Yeah. You said strop on. I just wanted to clarify. And it's. I don't. I don't know why he says that I'm an annoying person. He says I wound him up. Right. Which. I don't know. He says that you're. You're winding up because you're sort of like negative about everything. Yeah. And then. But what I think it is is because we pointed out that his lateness is unacceptable. Yeah. He said, meet you at six. He turned up at 20 past. He said, well, someone stopped me in the corridor. I don't care. I've got stuff to do. We have stuff to do. I think we're a bit busier than you, Carl. You've got one job. We've got loads of jobs. I keep telling you that. You got one job in a little room, a 9 to 5 there that you don't even get done in 9 to 5. That's why you're late and mucking around all the time. It's loads of work to do. Yeah, One job. No, it's not. It's one job with a lot of other jobs in it. It's like those little Russian dolls you. Get right off the go. Yeah, it is, yeah. Everyone thinks, oh, he only sits in his studio messing about, making songs. A phrase. That's what I do in my free time, which we've got coming up later. Super slick. I still think 20 minutes late is an outrage. Yeah, 20 minutes late is. But I didn't say bang on six. You said six. No, you didn't. You said six, which means six. Well, it doesn't. If it was a newsreader, I'd say, yeah, you've got to be on time. Do you know what I mean? If it was a 6 o'clock news, I wouldn't want to be late. But it's the fact that I said to you, I'm busy, I've got stuff. No, no, you didn't say that. He said 6:00 to sort out tomorrow. I didn't. I know what I said so. Yeah, well you don't because I remember you sent me a text. You didn't even. It wasn't even a phone call. Stephen has stitched him up by being a little bit more precise than him. It was a text and it said see you around 6 tomorrow, question mark Around. You just said it. But give me six. It doesn't count. That doesn't mean anything. Well, yeah, I know it does. What? So you told me he said six. Well, he did. I'm paraphrasing. 6:00, Rick. To me, even if it was around 6:00, that would be five to six or five past six. It would not be 20 minutes after the event because that is late. Well, you can't even. You can't. You've got nothing. You see, you haven't even got an excuse. Yeah, but then I turned up, right, And I said, right, well let's not argue about this. Let's come up with some good new features because we've been in cheapest chimps that's gone today. Good news. He never liked cheapest chimps car, did he? Right? He never liked it. Do you know what, do you know who's took it further? Donald McIntyre. He's doing, he's doing a program cheapest chimps. Well, we'll see again, I'll prove you right again. He's not doing a program cheap as chips, is he? He's not. What do you mean? He's doing a tour of trail on Channel 5 and it was saying, you. Know, is it 5 or is it about 20 past 5? He's doing this, he's done that, you know, now see him on channel five because he's moved to channel five. He's saying first big problem chimps, you know, the deer and that. No, they're not deer. He's getting confused. No, no. 50 odd grand for a chimp saying, you know, he'll look into how much you can get gorilla for. What are you. What are in the name of God are you talking about. We'll talk about that later. But I don't know what, I don't. Know, I'm just saying. That's another idea. Go on. You got off. This is why you never get stuff done in your late. You got off the point. You were talking about arriving late. Yeah, I know, but I'm just saying to you now, I'm just saying I turned up late so I said, right, well let's not argue. Yeah, I said let's do some stuff. Yeah, you weren't having any of it. I think at one point you were trying to be sick on me leg. I do remember that. Yeah. Why? Just, just for fun. Yeah. Alright. So that's when I started getting annoyed. He was very annoyed last night. No, yeah, okay. Yeah, I can see where that could be annoying, but you just gotta think, hey, look, say what? It's, you know. Well. Well, I think you rub each other up the wrong way. Yeah, that's the problem. Well, no more cheapest chimps today. Nothing to replace it because we didn't have a chat. Song's a phrase. We're doing that. You can win some stuff. Yeah. We've got the film that we haven't done for the last two weeks. The final film we want let them down. It's two weeks. So you're two weeks late on that. Can I just ask, guys, is there going to be some great music? Yeah. What about something from the Only Ones? Planet Brilliant. Another Girl, Another Planet by the Only Ones. An X Phone 104.9. I recognize with me Stephen Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl, cheer up. Come on, there's a war on. Chill out. Yeah. I have to say you have become increasingly annoying recently, Rick. Haven't really? Yeah. Cheeky. I tell you what is. I think it's the hot weather. Can I just remind you, when we were in the office recently, we've got a little office that we write in, we work in and many, many moons ago we were doing some work. This was when we were writing the first series of the Office and I was typing away, I was just typing something up we'd written and I read it back to Ricky, just checking he was happy with everything. I was reading it back and as part of the thing, there was a knock in the script. It said, you know, knock. And so I was acting out for him and knocked like this. And I realized he wasn't listening. He was in fact asleep underneath his desk. And I knocked like that as part of reading the stage directions. I knocked, he thought someone was coming in. He leapt up, clunked his head, zipped up, thoughts on and said, Rick, I'm just acting that out for you. He just wasn't paying attention, he wasn't listening and. Can I just draw? So recently we're in another office, we're typing away. I look round, he's got his shirt. Off, it was hot. He's taking his shirt off, right? So he sat there, 41 year old man or whatever you are, 40 year old man there with his shirt out. Beautiful. I mean, I've seen Most parts of your body now, at one point or another, I think from the early days when we used to work at xfm, you started showing me bits of your anatomy, which is something he does to people he likes, friends of his. I'm sure you've seen most of it, Carl. And so I saw a relationship. He sat there and there was a knock at the door because we'd asked someone who worked in the building to bring us something. And so I had to delay it by sort of not opening the door. So he could get his shirt back on. Yeah. So he was running around trying to get his shirt back on because what. Would they have thought? What would they have thought? They'd have walked in, he'd have just been sat there, stripped to the waist, didn't they? Sort of thing. Hang on, what's going on? Lock through the keyhole. No, it was ludicrous because as they came in, he. He was flustered and he kind of was just leaning against the window, just looking like. I often stand here with my. My shirt back. I was getting like, Bernard Manning. You see Bernard Manning, whenever he goes into the house, he has to go upstairs to take his trousers off. I love that. The fact that in your house you just got your pants and your vest on. That's what you want to do. Yeah, but it's all the time. It's not just. I mean, you haven't done that with me taking your clothes off and that yet. But like last night we were sat in the pub and I was saying, right, you know, let's not even worry about new features, then. Let's. Let's get the current ones, you know, going. Like what? Like the one that was trying to work out the cheeky freak of the week. Think of that, though, as a normal conversation. I'd looked online, right. I didn't find that much. I found. Actually, I'll tell you what I found later. Brilliant. We're looking for them, right? And then at one point, I think you said to me go, you know, what about the Guinness Booker Records? You know, they'll have like, the best freak of the. In the world or whatever. Yeah. Ever. So I said, yeah, yeah, bring one in now you've got one at home. Yeah. But you couldn't be bothered carrying that in today. So I had to go out of the pub that I was at. Yeah. Nip into Borders. Yeah. Buy a Guinness Book of Records. Yeah. Out of my own money. 18.99. Yeah. Bring it back. And then you said, oh, I don't know if I want to do this feature. So it cost me 20 quid for that. I had to buy a video for Silence of the Lambs film clip. I'm actually out of pocket at the end of this. But do you want to work with me? Is the thing. If you want to work with people would pay that sort of money to work with me. Carl, you're a lucky bloke. Think how many people think, oh, Carl, he gets to. Gets to drink and sit. Yeah. You were making a cup of tea and I surprised, didn't I? Little surprises, you know, last night, do you know, when I left the pub in a bit of a mood because I just fed up with not getting anything done. Yeah. Walking down the road, I was thinking, how can I get out of this? How can I stop having to work with them? I'm thinking, I wonder if I leave, I wonder if they'll be funny and they'll go. And then my boss will be giving me stick and thinking, how long? How much notice have I got to give out? And all this is going through my mind. I'm walking home and got in, said, suzanne, I'm sick of it. She's going, you need to do it when I get a new kitchen. And I was like, yeah, but how big does the kitchen need to be? I was saying, do we need a big kitchen? Can we get a small one? Have we got enough for a small kitchen? Do we need so many cupboards? Can we just have wood instead of steel? All this. Try to get out of doing this. Yeah. It's always. I always feel like, you know, because I like to think that I'm not perhaps as bad as him. Yeah. You know, I mean, different ways. Like what? How does he annoy you? Well, stuff. Stuff that, you know, I come up with ideas. Say, Cheap as Chimps, Rockbusters springs to mind. 15 Taiwan. 15 Taiwan. Let's just remind people what 15 Taiwan was. It was a little feature that I wanted to give a run. You know, give it a little run, see if people like it. The premise being. No, there's no premise, just a title. No, we were gonna get 15 sort of ornaments. You'd explain them and then people would call up and say, that Taiwan. Carl, you just explained why I didn't think that was a good idea by explaining the good. Funny thing is, Steve, right, I was walking down Regent street on Monday, walked past one of these big stores, right? And they've got all famous quote quotes on the windows, right? And one of them was something like an absurd idea is often a great idea. Yeah. Do you know who said that? Go on, Einstein. Yes. Which made me wonder, if you were his mate, would he ever done E equals MC squared, or would you have said, don't bother with that, it's not going to work because that's all you seem to do. Everything I come up with, you put down. Yeah, well, that's one thing. He's negative. Right. I don't know why. I don't know why he is. What else he messes me about. I get him concert tickets for stuff and you say, I didn't bother going. Yeah, yeah. That is annoying. You come in, you know, five minutes to go with trucks that need editing. Yeah, the little bag, that bag that was free. Yeah. You got a free bag today. An XFM little rucksack thing. Yeah. You were like, oh, what's this? What's this rubbish? Ricky said, I'll have it there. Great. He said, no, I want it. Yeah, well, it's free. I need it. Yeah, I'll give that to you. So, I mean, I think on reflection, Steve is probably a little bit more annoying than me. I won't go that far. You are. You are annoying. If I had to go away for a week somewhere, if it was a quiet place. You are again, aren't you? That's two orders you had this week, this year. I mean, if it was a busy place, I'd probably go with you. Because people, you know what I mean, staring at me all the time and that. If I'm walking around with Steve. No, I'm just. Can I drop a list of reasons I don't like you? Well, I'll tell you, because the list of reasons I don't about you is incredibly long and getting longer. Just saying. One other slap. There's A Star Ash XFM 104.9. Mickey J. Steve Merchant. Carl Pilkington. Carl. All right, let's start again. Yeah, I'm gonna be the same, but let's start again. So what I mean is, stop being grumpy and let's let me carry on being annoying. Because Steve's not gonna change. He's not gonna suddenly start going, you know what, Carl? I think your ideas are really good. Know what I mean? Remember when he came up with that idea, that game show idea? And you went. You went, well, it's not an idea, Carl. And he came to me, said. He said, oh, I've had it with Steve. What's it? He went, how did the Office ever get on telly? What was the idea again? In summary, I don't want to Talk about on air. Cuz someone will nick it. No they won't. They will. Donald McIntyre's already got cheap as chimps. I can. I bet they're in the making of Rockbusters as we speak. So I'm not. I'm not going to tell you anymore. I reckon Bob Olis is probably nicking that like cheeky little. Right. Song's a phrase coming soon. Is it? Yeah. What is it this week? What's the. What's the phrase? Where Remember the story told you ages ago about. About my neighbor having a horse in their house? Oh yeah. Having a horse. Yeah. What's happened with that? Lenny Henry doing it as a series so people nicking your ideas left, right and center. Well that's. That's the phrase we'll be using anyway. What? My neighbour had horse in her house. How many words is that? Six. My neighbour had. So there's no grammar either. My neighbour had horse in the house. My neighbour had horse in house. What? What is the phrase? My neighbour had horse in her house. Are there any prepositions? Are there any prepositions in this sentence? Look, don't judge it beforehand. You see, I'm turning over a new leaf. I think this is a great ide. I think Carl's a genius and I look forward to hearing this enormously. Okay. And I won't be sick on your leg or squeeze your head or make you jump when you're making a cup of tea. Just looking through the Ginsburg. That's still the funniest thing in it. Squeaking at someone when they got a cup of tea. Right. There are a lot of what strike me as seemingly pointless feats. The Guinsburg Records is right. The Guinsburg Records is great. I used to. I used to love it as a kid. I've had about 10 copies in my life. The last one I bought a couple of years ago present it was really good. I. I love it. I love the real records. Tallest, fattest, thinnest, best, fastest, most expensive, biggest out of that. But the ones that really annoy me are the ones that. The reason these people are in there for it are the only people that tried. What is the milk bottle on your head? Most watches eaten. I just found that one. Kim Sung do from South Korea ate five watches. The entire watch with the exception of the wristband in a time of 1 hour 34 minutes. What do you make of that? Carl made him regular. Come on. How did the timing. Most live rattlesnakes held in the mouth. Eight live rattlesnakes Held by. It just says an idiot. Ar. This gives me an idea, Carl, talking of idiots, do you want to get into this records, Carl? Come on. There's things in there that are just absolutely anyone could do. Like that one in Big Brother. I was watching it and it was balancing sugar lumps. I want to go, how many people try that? If there's schools around Britain going, listen, we got to get in the sugar lump award. We got. It's grassroots level. There's not enough kids balancing sugar lumps. How can we compete in the world market? I was looking at it last night and there was one about, about the farthest that a dog swam. I think it was something like nine miles. But it had no choice, did it? They took it out to Atlantic or something and so it didn't want to do. Threw it in the water. Yeah. So it's not alright to put it in a bin bag and chuck it in a canal, but, oh, it's for a world record nine miles. It did. Oh, God. Possible ones that you could do, Carl. What'S the most forest gumps fitted in one wheelie bin? What about this one for you, Carl? The record stands at the moment for most arrows caught by hand, but that's quite tricky. So what about most arrows caught by head? Yeah, they just fire arrows at your head. They would. They would just skim off him. Yeah. The roundness, it would never actually get any sort of, you know, connection. Fastest human crab. Could you do that? I'll do that. Can you do that? You just like go bending over backwards and running. What would you be good at? What about hamburger stuffing? Oh, right, Carl, let me. Alright. In the mouth, you mean? Well, it says the record for stuffing the most regulation sized hamburgers, including buns in the mouth at one time is how many. How many hamburgers with buns in there. This is just. You're not swallowing anything, you've just got stuff in your mouth. You'd be so good at this because you're shaped with your head. You've got a shape. Its head's just like Hamburglar. You'd be good at this, man. Yeah. Honestly, you'd be perfect. You look like Zippy. And the great thing is your head's empty so you could get more in there. Do you know what I mean? This guy had a brain. Do that, do that. What is it? Is it possible? Is it mental? Well, how many do you think it was? There were three burgers in buns. What do you reckon, Carl? Well, how quick he at them? He didn't eat them. It's just how many he can stuff in his face. So literally hold them within his cheeks and his mouth, but don't swallow anything. So how many burgers. How many burgers did he manage to get into his face? It's a fella. He's not. Yes, about. Not five. No, no, no. Three. He's the Lord Rack with three, though. It just says regulation size. So we go to McDonald's or Burger King and get just hamburgers and that would count. Just a regular burgers and we'll just stuff. It won't count. We got to get Norris McDonald's. But we could practice it now and then if we. If you're a triumphant. Come on, Carl. I don't. You know, I've got a small throat and that's a great thing. Yeah, but I don't like it as a kid, choking on stuff and I get funny about it. Well, no. Well, no, just keep your tongue at the back of your mouth. And we have to stuff the hamburgers in. No, I don't. Oh, come on, do something, Carl. That is dynamite radio ego. Steve will go and get the hamburgers. Have I gotta pay for them? No, give us the money. I can't spend 25 quid in total on a video on a Guinness Book of Records. That's costing me another four quid. Come on, come on, come on, give us money. Oh, come on. I'm not doing it. Come on, do it. It's a. It's an interesting thing. Come on. You could be in the Guinness Book of Records, Carl. No, leave it. See if we can. Oh, please phone in if you want, Carl. No, to eat burgers, you don't have to swallow them. You can spit it all out. You can be sick of my leg after. Oh, come on. I don't like that, the stretching thing either. Don't stretch it. It will stretch. I'll be like the little bloody dog on the Winston Churchill ad. Don't swear. I'm just saying, though. I know, but it's sweet. We apologise to the Radio Authority. Kyle is not only swearing, but he's refusing to do things we come up with. But the Radio Authority will be happy with me stuffing three burgers in my face. I'm not doing it. Yeah, we will. I'll give you the. We do Songs of Phrase or something. Play record. Play record. He's going to go, you're going to do it, Carl, or. Or you're fired. No, actually, he wants that. No, you're going to do it. Do it, please do it. It'll be great, honestly. Please do it. What about Chicken McNuggets? Meet halfway? No, there's no record for Chicken McNuggets. Mental. So I'm not doing it, Steve. So you are. You are 104.9 in London xfm. Steve. Hello, can you hear me? Yes. Can you hear me? Yeah. Where are you? I'm in one of the capital's many burger joints. I'm just about to go up now and order some burgers. Where are you? Where are you in. I'm in McDonald's in Leicester Square. Alright. Okay. What are you getting? Just I need to order five regular hamburgers, please. That's all right. Sorry, five hamburgers? Yes. Yes. You're probably wondering why I'm ordering only five hamburgers, aren't you? And let me tell you why, my friend is going to try and break the world record for putting burgers into his fat stupid face. What do you reckon? That exciting? Yeah. Do you wish him good luck? Yeah. What's your name? Tyre. Oh, thank you very much, Tyre. I'll try and get Ty to wish you good luck in a minute. Kyle. Five should be enough. The world record is what? Three. Three. Yeah. Okay, good. I don't know what. Oh, here we go. How much is that? 345. 345 for five hamburgers. It's good, isn't it? It's good value. It is really, isn't it? Really? Yeah. I mean, if there's anyone from hamburgers from McDonald's listening, they probably want to give us some free stuff. I thought, Rick, you just wish my friend good luck before he's just on the end of the line there. Just say, good luck, Carl. Good luck. There you are. That's the people from McDonald's wishing you good luck, Carl. I'll be back shortly with the burgers. Brilliant. Okay. Do you want the pickles left in Eminem Sing for the moment on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant with Five Little Hamburgers. Five burgers here. Yep. And so I don't know. How should we begin? Carl, do you want to just look at the size of these burgers? They're quite. Oh, look, they can see it on webcam, can't they? They can see us stuffing these burgers into your mouth. And by the way, I'm filming this, Steve. Brilliant little camcorder. We'll put this on unseen footage on a DVD or something or maybe on. The website on the web. Oh, Carl, what if you break the record. Okay, Carl, I'm coming around now to. To just monitor this and adjudicate. What's the web? If people want to see this on the webcam, what is it? Xfm.co.uk Right. Okay. No, you're funny. I'm not being funny. Right, but I think I have got, like, a bit of a weak thing. You've got a bit of a what? A wheat allergy. Oh, don't give me that. No, seriously, me heads. I've been eating a lot of Shredded Wheat recently and me head's got a bit bigger. God. I don't think you can let us down now, mate. So just. You just gotta put that first. No, I can't. I can't put that like that in my mouth. On. It's with. I've gotta break it up. I've got to break it up. It doesn't say you can't on the rule thing. It does. It doesn't. I can't look. I physically can't. Try it. The. I can't look. I'd have to be j. Goody. Seriously, look. Yeah, I know, but you're not doing. You're not approaching it. Right, that's. Oh, come on. Come on. That's almost. Keep going, keep going, keep going. That's good work. That's good work. Keep going. How do they get. Keep pushing. Keep pushing. Easy to. Keep pushing. Get one in at least. Easy. Get one in. At least. Get one in. Get one in. Push it, push it. That's one. That's one. Let's go get another one. Night swimming. R.E.M. night swimming. It's a lovely song in it, Carl. Huh? Xfm 154.9. Look at your raise with me, Steve Merchant, Carl. Disappointing. Disappointing. You couldn't even get one whole burger in your mouth. I did, kind of. Yeah. But there's a bit sticking out. It just looked messy. But you were saying about putting it in whole and you. I don't think that's the rule. Okay. It's like more in a suitcase if you. If you put things in properly. So don't just get all your clothes and chuck them in. So it's about. I reckon you've got to rip it up a bit. Okay, do that then. See how many you can get in. You gotta get in two. No, just. Just one. No, well, it's three. But what you do, pack your cheeks first. Honestly, Steve, me head is swelling a bit because I have got a wheat thing. That'd be good. There'd be more room. Right, okay, look, Carl is Now just sticking it in his cheek. Yeah, don't eat any. You can't swallow any. It's like a hamster. You gotta work it like a hamster. Yeah, stick it in. Come on. He looks like Marlon Brando in the Godfather. Come on, don't lose any yet. Right, pack it in then. Use your fingers to pack it in. Come on, wedge it in like you're grating the bath. I can't do this either. Keep going, keep going, keep going. Don't give up so early. This is part of the problem. You just give up, Carl. Too quickly. You failed again. It's like your history. O level. Come on, Kyle. Come on, do something. Well, succeed at something. Push it in. You've got nearly a half a burger there. Or I'll come round. I'll come round there. You're chewing. Don't chew. I've gotta be able to think. I don't know what he said, but. Is that a whole one? What? Is that whole one? No, it's not. I can see if it's left. Come on, Carl. Come on. Keep working on it. Keep working on it. There's so much space in your mouth. I can see it. He's going mad. Okay, okay, we do another one. We've got another one then. We're doing. Oh, are you alright? Are you gonna be sick? Are you all right? All right. Oh, gosh. We play record. He's making my eyes water now. Oh, okay. I'll find a different one for you. Find a different one for most drinks. Eaten in three minutes. I'll go. Do you want to do that? Great. That's easy. Great. Come on. Jesse Mailing. That's called Wendy. White stripe. Seven nation Army. That jumped twice. I apologize for that. You're the producer, Carl. Yeah, it jumped twice. Well, it's not my fault if people are slipping around because of burgers on the floor. Don't try to squeeze my head when the song's playing. What difference does that make anyway, right? Don't take any. Right, I've just got some grapes there. We've counted them out. What's the record then? Okay, well, the most grapes eaten in three minutes. You've got three minutes, Carl. And you've got to beat Matt hand from the UK, who consumed a total of 100, 133 grapes in three minutes on the 8th of November 2001. Right. There's 150, 115 there. Right, okay, so you've got three minutes. What are the rules? The rules? You just gotta eat them and swallow Them and it's like Call and Luke, right? You gotta just stuff them in and don't choke because I got worried with the burger. That's a Good advert for McDonald's, isn't it? Not only was I impressed by the cheapest of them, but he couldn't even get one in his mouth. Yeah, so value for money there. Maybe they'd like to send us some free stuff. Yeah, free stuff or just money? Any. Some money would be good next week, Carl, you're eating Sony Walkmans available for. Right, Right, Carl. Well, I think this is. This is gonna be good, right? What we're gonna do, right, We've got song two by Blur set up. We know that's two minutes, so you can play that. Because that'd be boring radio hearing Kyle choke, wouldn't it? For three minutes. So when I say go, Carl, right, I'm gonna go right on the minute, right? You've got to have a handful of grapes and you've got a press song too, by Blur. When we come back, you'll be stuffing your face. Hold on. You won't be able to do that. Can you work the buttons? I can do that. No, I don't think you can. You cannot touch the grapes until the opening when the Blur two. When song two stops. Can we just press up the fader so you. Because you'll be stuck. Don't worry. We're almost. We got. Let's go. If we go. Okay. Any second there. Okay. Right. Okay. Three, two, one, go. And he's off. That's good work from Carl there. He's just. He's approaching it cautiously to begin with. Cautiously. And he's just. Yeah, you know, just keeping people. Come on. Don't make him laugh. He's choking. He's choking. Oh, come on, quick. Keep going, Carl. Come on. Do on. Come on. What happened? Did he just throw up? No. Don'T make him laugh. Come on. We can make wine. Come on, Carl, you're doing so well. I want to go. Come on. Why are you making him laugh? That was a world record attempt. He's over. Keep going. Come on. You got 25 seconds. Come on. I think that was. That was a shame, actually, because you were doing well, but something went wrong. I know. And I think those are bigger grapes than the ones I've seen before. They're quite big grapes. Look at his face. He looks so despondent. Come on, Carl. Eight seconds. Just a few more. Five. Come on. What's the matter? Two, two, one. It's all over, Carl. It's all over. We better count how many you did. You can get good at this. We can get good at this over the weeks. I think that was a fairly pitiful attempt actually. I really thought you had a. It's interesting actually. These are harder records than you might think. Yeah, I know. How do you feel after that record breaking attempt? Not happy with that. What are you not happy about? The fella who did it? Was he in hospital and just had loads of grapes on his board? You can sure he wasn't producing a radio program, that's for sure. Well, to be fair, neither of you. What was tricky about it, what did you find hard? I think having Ricky standing over me. So shouting go on. Isn't normal, but did that. So that wasn't eaten any. That's 50 left. That's quite a poor attempt then by the seam of it. Would you think about trying to maybe do that again in a couple of weeks? Would you do some practice and try that again? Leave it, leave it for the experts. I know it's a tricky point. Maybe sort of when you had about 50 seconds to go, you seemed to be spewing things into the bin. What was that again? Mainly Ricky standing over me. So 88. He's got 88 left. Okay, so what's the mental arithmetic there? Because we hit put how many in was 150 in the thing, wasn't it? What did I say? What did I say I had left? Well, I'm not doing anything. 88. So he had 88 left. 62 guys, you're only at 62. What's the matter with you, Carl? There's people start you at 62. That is rubbish. That's disappointment. So you, well you. So you failed on two world record attempts. 62. And the records are. That is rubbish. What were you doing? Oh yeah, but like I said, I've got a small throat. I can't. I can't drink a drink quick. Ever since the Mr. Freeze pops when I was 6 that I nearly choked on, I nearly died on. I can't go back. It'd be like asking, I don't know, someone who got run over to play Frogger or something. That was Frogger. What you mean real life? Well, just a computer game. Brings back memories, doesn't it? And I can't do that. What does Frogger. Does Frogger get run over? Yeah, it's a little frog and it has to run across. Do you know who he reminded me of? Apart from Hamburglur and Zippy and all that when he was mentioning Those grapes. Because the shape of his head, it looked like a game of Pac Man. Yeah. As he was getting to him it looked like he should have adopt music. It looked just like it. Oh, Carl. There was a board game version of Pac Man. Was there? I mean the only thing that Pac man had was the fact that it was on a computer and it was a little face eating things. But imagine that as a board game. But there's board games of like things that you don't need board games for. It's like there's board games of charades. Do you know what? You don't need that. It's like parlour games, board games of let's watch the telly. Yeah, let's play sit around and it's all like 1999. You don't need it. New from Mattel. A stick. Simply run along clanking it against a fence or a metal grate. It's fence stick in a picture of it. Nan, Nan, that's my stick. I'll tell you what, that's my fence stick. Do you know I saw in a shot recently the board game of Cold Feet, the TV show. That is a winner. You are John Thompson. Yeah, go back. Yeah, see a good game, drink eight pints. Songs of Phrase. Songs of Phrase. Nicely done. Right, we'll get this going. How do you feel, Carl? Yeah, again, disappointment, disappointment, disappointment probably to your family and friends. Well, I don't think they'll be get that gutted, to be honest. Right, the song's a phrase. God, why don't we come up with Sors of Phrase? Because it's a big tease. People love that, you know, it's one of the hot new. We've got one more thing for you to eat. No, I'm not doing anyone. Seriously. Play a song. Right, Songs of Phrase next. That was rubbish, that half hour. Rubbish. That's great. Roots the seed xfm 104.9. I bet that is a record of eating grapes whilst DJing. Possibly. I'm assuming if there's any listeners out there that have a record breaking attempt they'd like to see Carl undertake in future weeks, they should email in I think. I think Jono's got that one. Right, what we got then? That's that. That's the silliest side. Now let's get on with the proper show. Songs of Phrase. Yeah, should we do that onto the classy stuff? Yeah. Do you want to do the prizes first? Right, now then, where are they? Here they are. I haven't seen these but I'm excited as ever. All right, we have a T shirt there. Arbitrary T shirt that you have probably stolen off of someone. What does it say? Is it the Red Hot. The Red Hot Chili Peppers. So that's not too bad. A big T shirt there. On dvd. Should you be giving this away? This looks like it's the film don't say a Word. And it doesn't have all the proper packaging. It's literally the disc, the DVD disc, just loose. So enjoy that. The current album from Oasis, Heathen Chemistry DVD on dvd, the Life of Mammals, the Complete Series. The David Attenborough recent dvd Walking With Cavemen, which I think is a DVD currently on tv, isn't it? Well, there you go. Also the X List, which is a good new compilation, double CD compilation from XFM with loads of stuff on there, including nerd, Snoop Doggy Dog, athlete, all sorts. Go on, then. Car. So not bad, actually. Last one. So, yeah, it's a phrase that. That's been said at some point or said a lot on the show. We've had like hairy Chinese kid we went back to. My mom had wind for five minutes and that. Today we're looking at. My neighbor had a horse in a house. Right. If you remember, we were talking about that probably about a year and a half ago now. Yeah, yeah, of course, people. Of course people remember. They've been talking about ever since Carl, I imagine. Yeah, well, it's famous. It's a world famous phrase. My neighbor had a horse in their house. Right. So this is this week's Songs of Phrase. And what I've done is I've got songs with those words in that. Make up that sentence. Yeah. You go email in ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk there's six different songs, right? You email him with what? I don't know. There is six. Me neighborhood had horse in house. Is it really that sentence, My neighbour. Had a horse in house. It does work, honestly. It works. Yeah. Okay. Don't bother explaining it. Just play it. Yeah, so here's the. Here it is. We're just in a house, Right? What in God's name was that? Yeah, name the six songs. Head boys in a house. Are we naming the artists or the songs? Either Artists. Anyone who gets anything can get a prize. Artists. Here we go. That's tricky, Carl. That's very hard. Once more. Email in Ricky Gervais xfm.co.uk. I'll give it another letdown. Another letdown. It's brilliant, this. How can you just say that after I've Just been stuffing grapes in my face. Well, in fact, you found you didn't get one burger in right even when you tried to chop it up. There's three. Right. So that's it. Steve out the goodness of his heart went to McDonald's. Okay, I got some grapes at 62. That's got nothing to do with this, though. This is my game show here. Bob Oleness didn't say, yeah, Blockbusters is good, but I never see him eating grapes. So this is a different thing. Forget that. There's Eclipse again. These are clips. Oh, you know, I said I was going to turn over a new leaf and not criticize your ideas. I think it's the end of this one, mate. Oh, he's done it again. It's atrocious. Ricky Gervais@xfm.co.uk if you've got any idea. Dandy Wore Holes. We Used to be friends. That is Carl's favorite record of the year. Yeah, he gets, he gets one. He gets one play a year and he chose that. That's what he chose. It's all right. But I mean that favorite track, isn't it? He played that. That was, that was Carl's choice. Just something new on XFM 104.9. Don't worry, we've got some really good stuff coming up later with me and Steve. If you're from the 70s, do you might like it? You see that he's getting too cocky and he arrogant. It's sort of like he's. I, I mean, we try and we've TR something in his life he's got, you know, I mean, he's is. He comes in and tells us this, this sob story of just like a trail of failures. And we said, carl, come under our wing, right? He's just started picking up on him a few other people and then he does that. He fails at the burgers, he fails at the grapes. He will not trust us with, you know, what we want to do. I don't know what more we can do. It's like I've saved a mouse from a, from a cat's jaws and it turned around and bit me. Yeah, yeah. That is a brilliant analogy. It's a bit like we were trying to give you something that you could care about, that you could be passionate about that would somehow give a meaning to your life. You would be in the Guinness Book of Records alongside Bubble. Bubble failed. Do you want to be Bubble? Do you want to be Bubble? Or do you want to be the bloke with a milk bottle? On his head. Who's in there? The guy who make the watches? Yes. Now, I've got an idea, Carl, because you're getting all stressed. I don't know what it is. You're getting funny. I don't know what it is. I don't know what. Wow. Midweek. I don't think I annoy anyone else. So it's just you on that. So I thought maybe we could, all three of us, go away to a little health farm for a weekend, just get like a triple room. And that isn't happening. Why? You've just reminded me. Because you've been annoying me, Steve. Started getting on your case, you know, sort of ganging up on me. I'll tell you now, Steve, I just forgot. Remember a couple of weeks ago you said to me that my pub team, pub quiz team is rubbish? Yeah. Right. Well, it doesn't matter anymore because you're not part of it this time. That's bad because it's interesting you say that. Carl. Carl, you say that because I tell you this, I found someone. I found someone, mate, who could be filling that tricky fifth member. I wanted to test them out this week, mate, on your team. On your team. Test that on your team. Because I'll tell you what, this is like. I don't know if you feel familiar with. With Paul Ince, who used to play with Man United, right, But everyone used to say he's the governor, right? Even the players used to call him the governor, right? And Alex Ferguson at Man United was like, I'm not having this. I'm in charge here. And he got rid of him. And that's what's happened. You, you were moaning the other week, saying your team's rubbish. You don't know what you're doing. Yeah, well, let's see how you do on your own, right? He's turned, isn't he? I'll be honest, Carl, I'd like to be on your team. Well, sorry, Paul Ince, you'll have to go and join Middlesbrough or wherever it is he's gone to. Carl, what can I do to get back on your team? It's not happening. I've already filled you boost. Don't let him have the upper hand, Steve. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wait a minute. I'll tell you what always annoys me, though. Ricky spends most of the show slagging you off, right? Having a go at you, annoying you in the week, squeezing your head, making you eat burgers, right? But you always take out on me. I'm the one who always gets the insults. I'm the one who's now relegated from your team. Why? You see, this is the thing. You're just as bad as him. Really? Because you're siding against me because you know that I'm. I'm willing to take it. You what? The truth of it is this, you know, that Ricky Gervais is keeping you. He's keeping you in burgers and grapes, metaphorically speaking. He's the one that's got you in Heat magazine. I just spat all over your new Guineas book of records. You see. Get me a tissue. He's just squirted t laughing all over your guitar records. You may not get the flack for that. No, he's. Because you. You made me laugh when I was drinking. Because you went and it made me laugh and I smiled. I just think it upsets me that you never pick on Ricky. You never ever go in because, you know, he's the one who's raised your profile and made you a little bit of a celebrity. We've missed one here. Using his teeth Ramen. Andy Appan. Right? Husk toke. Coconut. He did what? He husked a coconut. He's the fastest coconut husker in the world. What does that mean? I don't know. He pulls huskers. He pulls husks. What's that? What's a coconut husking? He pulls the curse up. Look at Carl just with his head down. Carl, come on. What's the matter? Because that cost me 20 quid. I know. Well, I'll see you. All right? I'll tell you. All over. The world's smallest man. Why have they stood him next to the world's biggest man? Well, I'm in a bad mood now. Oh, dear. So you haven't got a team. Steve, I'll sort you out. Come to me. I'll sort you out. Don't worry. Who would help you win this week? Carl. And I was going to tell you about it and now, Steve, you can. Be on my team this week and I know something about the quiz that Carl doesn't know. So I'll tell you. I just think that it's. It's so ungrateful. So ungrateful. Right, Songs are phrase. Just give it a couple more plays. Just email him. We'll pick a winner soon. Ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk. Well, this isn't. This is rubbish. This week. No one knows it because it's rubbish. Steve was right. There's six songs there, so if you know What? They are just. That's the end of that. I think that's the end of Songs. Of Phase Email in. I think that's the last week for that. Okay. Why didn't you give us some monkey news? Is it monkey. Come on, Monkey news. Play a song and we'll. No, no, no, let's play a song. Oh. Oh, it's a great track. Cheer up, Carl. Waiting for an Alibi within Lizzie. Oh, what year? Doesn't have to be new. It's brilliant. What year was that? Oh, Einstein wasn't new when he came up with the greatest theory ever. Oh, die. Hey. Oh, you're not new. You're not new. Waiting for an Alibi by thin Lizzie on XFM 104.9. Right. Okay, just. This is. Oh, all the. With all the trauma in the world, I thought we'd come on a little bit and he's just brought it right down a little. Mank twat whinges. No, but I mean. Do you know what I mean? He's had a go at you. He's thrown you off his team. I'm devastated by that. That was, you know, that was the one thing I was looking forward to. This week, to be fair. You were looking forward to telling him you were taking over the team. So it's sort of poetic justice. It has blown up in your face, to be fair. True. I was. I was trying to squeeze him out of his own company. Yeah, you were going to try and get him out of it, his team. Yeah. Well, I thought it was a hostile takeover and they sort of. They clubbed together. There's normally three regulars on his team. I got two of them on my side, one of which was his girlfriend. So I only had to work on him to try and get him to resign. And we'd have been away still, you know, we should give the prizes away. Yeah, well, this is. This has been dreadful, that. This thing. We started off well with him trying to force burgers in his mouth and then he'd come up with this tapped. I mean, this is. This is the end of this, because it's. I mean, it was shoddy to start with now that the other couple. Well, this is not only. I'm just saying. This is what I was saying in the pub yesterday when you try to be sick on me leg. I was saying, come up with new ideas if you don't like them, but you dis them on air. Well, it's just disappointing, isn't it? What's that? I was disappointed when I was choking before. We Were disappointed as well. Yeah, you can choose. Try. You didn't try with the grapes. You were just, like, chewing all that. You meant to just throw them in and swallow them. Songs of phrase. It was six songs. It sounded like this. What are they? Just give the answers. Six songs. There we had Lionel Richie. My Destiny for My Tricky neighbour. Oh, that's XFM. My neighbour was space. Space neighbourhood. Had Harry Connick Jr. Had to be you. Right. Your neighborhood. A horse. America. Yeah. Another horse in was Lisa Sansfield with pathetic in all the right places. Did anyone get that? Did anyone get that? No, no one got that. That was pointless. All right, well, the most. The most anyone got was three. And so we're gonna give it to Deborah, and that's possibly Deborah and Kate. They got at least three of those. So. Okay, well done. Yeah. There's prizes on the way. That's the end of that. So that's there. No cheapest chimps. None of that anymore. What have you got left? You got the film to do? Let's see what you're doing with the film. Hang on. I'd love to have some monkey news, though. Go on, then. Got any monkey news? Yeah, I got some monkey news. Come on, then. No, Rick. Come on, cheer up. Well, it's. It's just sort of like he moans that he's got too much time on his hands and he comes up with that. Okay. Shite. Monkey news. The jingle, please. Oh, chimpanzee that. Monkey news. There's been quite a lot of stuff going on. There was a few bits in that Guinness Book of Records book that cost me 20 quid. Yeah, that's not news, is it? They printed that probably last September. There's one in there. New music. New music. New. New monkey news from last September. You're a lord. Come on, Waster. Please, Ricky. Monkey news, right? There was this. This monkey in. In a zoo in Brazil. Right, Right. And this. Little man monkey, little woman monkey. And. You're a scientist, aren't you? Go on. And they said the people in charge were like, oh, wouldn't it be good if they had kids? Brilliant. Right. So anyway, the chimps used to stand sort of. You know, they'd have the little caves each. And these are sort of. They used to sort of lean on the fence, having a bit of a chat and stuff with each other. The equivalent sort of thing. Yeah. So anyway, they were getting on a storm and like, the zookeepers were like. Can you hear that? Cheapest chimps this week. I thought it was fascinating. Yeah. Just. Just gossiping. I understand. Any monkey news? I don't know. What was monkey news this week? Go on. It was from last September. So they were. There was, you know, stood there having a chat. And the zookeepers were like, I wonder if they're ever gonna, you know, have kids and that. Yeah. Anyway, it went on for ages, you know, this. Just chatting, no sort of action. So what the zookeepers did was they. They said, I know they'll have kids. Are we letting that go? They were just chatting. Are we just letting that go? You know what I mean? I mean, just doing whatever monkeys do. So. So, yeah. So the zookeepers were like, yeah, I wonder when they're gonna, you know, have some kids. Anyway, what they decided to do. To sort of do. To egg them on. Yeah. Bought one of them a suit one. A wedding dress. Right. Keep going. No, I'm not having it. Shut up, Javace. Fade him down. If he's gonna interrupt. I wanna hear the rest of this. They got married. So they got married. Yeah. They got married, right? What? That's the end of it. This is why I don't cry. That's the end of Monkey News. That's the end of Monkey News. Don't do that again. You've got no features left. Why don't you like that? It's not a story. It's about two chimps chatting, which doesn't happen. The zookeeper's going, I wonder if they're gonna ever have Caids egg em on. They got married. That's the end of the story. What are you talking about? Hang on, Just calm down. Let me just check that you didn't make a mistake there and didn't lose out. What do you mean he didn't make a mistake? Wait a minute. He may have just left out a fundamental piece of information. What, the story that would have made it into a story. Right. Just check. Let me just check the facts. So they bought them wedding outfits, they were married. Did they propose to each other or did they. Were they just forcibly encouraging? And then what was the outcome once they got married, what happened? They fell in love. Yeah. It's not a marriage, Carl. It's not a real marriage. I don't know what you've got in your head. It's like the head of Homer Simpson. I'd go in there and there'd be a wedding reception and there'd be a couple of fights and they'd be talking about stuff. They got married, they fell in love. Did they have children? They're not back off the running moon yet. Play a Record. You got no feature features left. You got one feature left. I come back. The film. You and the film. Yo, 1, 2, 1, 2. We are the D people. Satisfaction. New single. Yeah. XFM. Quick. Play it. Right. We've waited three weeks. We are going to play it. I don't care whether we're late. We were late in because there was news. So play it. Which film are you in this week. Looking at Silence of the Lambs. Right, Play it. Just play it. Have we got a question? No. Who cares? Who cares? Should Carl. Carry on. Play it. Right. Silence of Lambs. The bit where Jody Foster is having a chat. Good evening, Clarice. All right. Just thought I'd come and see you. Oh, very sorry. Don't mind me popping in though, do you? It's just. Just no one else is interested in the sort of things I like talking about. People will say we're in love. Well, say what they want. Do you hear the show last week? We were talking about gay people. If they should have their own toilets or not stuff. That was good. It's all right. Got a good. Good debate going. Enjoy doing the show. It's a favorite part of me week, really. Just talking about weird stuff and that. Oh, Clarice, your problem is you need to get more fun out of life. I have a lot of fun in my life, you know, Come and see you. And spend a lot of time on the Internet looking up weird stuff. Who can song about having airy Chinese kid. There's another thing. There's a fellow who. No arms and legs. He's known as a pillar man. Everything you need to find him is right there in those pages. Bizarre magazine. Yeah, I get this. The hairy Chinese kid. What annoys me is he could sort it out. He could just have a shave, couldn't he? No, he covets. Does he? Well, use some. Some of that emac stuff. Don't be getting funny with me just because you're in a bit of a mood. Right. You know, you shouldn't eat people. Your eyes are bigger than your belly. I've always said that. So I'll see you. Interesting. Atmospheric. Moody. And the question is. Okay, here I have it. This. How many films have been made featuring the character Hannibal Lecter? How many films have been made? I haven't got time to phone in now. They can email in. They'll have time. Do you care? I don't care. No. Exactly. Ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk if you can be bothered. If you're interested in what and you want a £4.99 copy on VHS. Also, he's dissing that as well, Carl. Bit annoying, but that's it for this week. But remember what happened when. No, it's not. It's nine minutes to three. How can that. No, no, no. How can that be it? It's nine minutes to three. What's he doing? Is he playing a record? Carl, what can I do to get back on your quiz team? You're not. Go on. Right, so, right. Send Carl a little present. Send him some essential oils or summer or. I mean, a little lavender pillow or just a little. Little message. Send him a little message. Tell him it's all worth it. He's getting all grumpy, aren't you? I just get sick of it, that's all. It's not worth going through the stress for 30 quid every Saturday. You lying little. You get more than 30 quid. Not much more. Anyway, Steve, who's the winner? The winner is Mike McNulty. He correctly answered the fact that there were four films featuring Hannibal Lecter. There's a downer. Now he's a downer. I think it was you, actually. I mean, I don't know, Carl. I'm not. It's not like I'm just trying to win myself a place on your team, but I actually felt that Ricky was really out of place. I gave him grapes. I thought Ricky was discourteous, if that's a word. I thought he was rude, aggressive, unpleasant, as one person emailed in a dickhead. So. Someone also said you were fat and talentless. So I don't like those emailers who do that sort of thing. But one of them said you were really, really annoying. Well, cheers for that. But you still need to know what you're wearing. So back next week. What did you say? Cheers to that music.",

Can I just remind you, when we were in the office recently, we've got a little office that we write in, we work in and many, many moons ago we were doing some work. This was when we were writing the first series of the Office and I was typing away, I was just typing something up we'd written and I read it back to Ricky, just checking he was happy with everything. I was reading it back and as part of the thing, there was a knock in the script. It said, you know, knock. And so I was acting out for him and knocked like this. And I realized he wasn't listening. He was in fact asleep underneath his desk. And I knocked like that as part of reading the stage directions. I knocked, he thought someone was coming in. He leapt up, clunked his head, zipped up, thoughts on and said, Rick, I'm just acting that out for you. He just wasn't paying attention, he wasn't listening and. Can I just draw? So recently we're in another office, we're typing away. I look round, he's got his shirt.",
