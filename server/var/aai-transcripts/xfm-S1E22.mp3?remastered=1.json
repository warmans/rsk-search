We didn't want to play a certain record he had lined up because it's rubbish. I know, but you do this every week because it's. Because the most of them are rubbish. So that's why we choose. No, but 30 seconds to go on the track and you're saying, don't want to play that. And you're going, oh, it's stressing me out. You're meant to be at our beck and call. We've. We've made you. We've made you. We got you out the gutter and now you're getting greatest mind in the world. That doesn't mean you can mess me about. If you were a doctor and you saved me life. Yeah, right. There comes a point, in a way we have. Carl. Yeah. Where were you going? No, no, what was he gonna say? He was gonna say something wise then. No, I was gonna say, right, if, if. If you were a doctor. Yeah. And you'd save me life. Yeah. There's only so much that I could give back to you. Right, okay. What would be unreasonable? What would be unreasonable? Well, you know, forget doctor, don't forget. No, no, the doctors. That's his job, right? Supposing I was just. I just walking along and I saved your life. I gave you a kidney or, you know, recessed or I dived into icy water. What, what could I hope from you then before you started going, hold on, hold on, what, what would you. What would you be willing to do for me until you sort of got, you know, lost your rag a little bit because I was asking too much. So. Didn't I know you before? You've like sorted along out for me. No, I just gave you a lung, for example. Well, I'd be a bit sort of. I'd be thinking, why has he done that? Suspicious. But what I love though, Rick, is the idea of you jumping in icy water to save someone, giving them a lung. I can guarantee if someone was lying on the floor screaming, they needed your help, you'd affect a foreign accent and go, I know, understand, and run off. Do you know what I did once, right, we went out a few weeks ago, right, and some woman had an ambagnict and she was all distressed. He said, chase the fella, Carl. You stole my. Let's be honest, Imagine Ricky chasing a criminal. Look at his little legs. He'd never get anywhere. He started to run and then he passed Starbucks or something. Nipped for a short. How did this turn on me? Oh, I'm a bad man because I don't give lungs away. No one would want my kidneys or my lungs, for a start. Hello. Did you chase the criminal, then? I did for a bit. He walked. No, you didn't. You. No, I did a little bit, yeah. We'd sort of spread out. We missed him. Where was it and what was the situation? It was. Did you see a bag get snatched? No. She was sort of crying and she was running. Some blokes came and sat next to her and then just ran off with her purse and. And you walked after them? No, no, they'd gone, Steve. They. I mean, yeah, they'd actually gone, but it was just like a bit distressing because she was. She was devastated. I know how she feels as well because I. A jacket. And you think, oh, I'll just gotta find them now. Where are they? Who are they? You know, so she was really off her head with sort of like. She was angry and sort of crying. Yeah. And it was horrible. It was horrible, wasn't it? Wasn't it? Carl, he's broken his mic now. What are you doing, mate? You just. I don't believe this. There's only two weeks to go. These should be special. Carl, play the record. We've asked you to play the record like you finally. Live. Hives. Main offender on XFM 104.9. I forgot to say who I was. Go on, who are you? Steve Merchant. And he's that little fella over there, little round fella, tiny little Carl Pilkington. The funny little thing from the smash adverts say, then they smash them with their metal knives. Ah, yeah, you're right, it does, doesn't it? Yeah, yeah. I was asking if I seen a rounder head than him and that's the only one someone come up with. That is the only thing they got. Oh, look. Oh, look, you're actually a little bit stressed there, aren't you? Because you had to drink last night, didn't you? I had a couple of drinks, yeah. I was down at Steve's night. He was doing a bit of DJing. Yeah. Went down the store and that's why you're all grumpy. Did you hear what he just said? I was DJing last night, obviously. That XFM evening. Hour and a half. My friend and I split the time on the decks what was the word you just used? He went down a storm. We went down a storm. Right. Three girls. I was walking to the toilets during my set. Three girls went, you are a genius. Right. What's his name? Dane Bowers. Zane, love, because you played records in a certain order. Yes. Sorry, Rick. Sorry, Rick, if you can't deal with that. Sorry, if you're a little bit jealous, because this time you can't share the award. All right. But it was my credit this time. He hasn't been a dj. Because it's not just about. It's not just about that. The songs you play, it's the way you play them. Oh, yeah. The way you play them, whether it's 33 or 45, very important. Yeah. Leave your hand on them as they're trying to go round. But. But. So three girls there, charmed by me. They loved Zane Lowe, XFM DJ and MTV presenter. Probably one of the coolest blokes alive. EK gave his massive respect. He said, I'm loving your set. He actually used those words. Right. There were people coming up. They couldn't believe their luck. It was roaring. We'd stick on a track, people would cheer as it came on. Right. My particular favorite, Carl, I think you'll agree, My particular triumvirate, LL Cool J mama said, knock you out. Leading straight into House of Pain. Jump around then straight into that current Elvis track that's been re released, remixed by Junkie xl. I played the original, which I'd already played on XFM before. I'm already there. Cutting edge. Yeah. Right. I think. What? Three old tracks? You mean three old tracks in a row? Yep. And what I think the words that would best sum up are I kicked ass. Great, Rick. All right, well, I'm going to be kicking some ass today because I'm gonna be shamelessly self indulgent. And we've only got two shows to go, so I'm playing some of the most beautiest tunes in the world. I was just telling Carl, lined up with Simon and Garfunkel, track only living boy in New York. He went, why is he the only living boy in New York? I went, what? He went, what does that mean? Then I went, I don't know. What's it about? I said, I. I don't. Don't care. It's lovely. No, what's it. I said, I don't go into that. I said, I like a story. I said, like I said, killing a Georgie. No trickery. Killing of Georgie. I think we should play that at last. It's good. I heard it the other day on radio too. It was cracking. It sounds like. Well, it's really good. Tell them what it's about again. It's about little girl. Gay fella. A little gay fella. Yeah. Right. I mean, I haven't heard it for a bit, so it's all off memory, this, but gay bloke. Is he from Scotland? I have no idea. But he's from somewhere where gays aren't liked. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no. Georgia Boy was Gargay. It's nothing more than the kindest guy I ever knew. Right. Now, all he did was right. His father said, how can my son not be straight? Kicked him out. Right. Goes to America. Yeah, yeah. But you can handle all that. You can handle your dad not getting on with you if other people around you are into the same scene. Yeah, but it's like he was left on his own. He didn't know what to do. Yeah. He was getting stressed out. Yeah. So he goes, this was before. Like, this was before. I mean, this is what. When did this record come out? Yeah, Right, right, right. During punk, Right. Oh, yeah, yeah. So you know the Village People had come along and made gay cool. Yeah, that had already happened. Yeah. But it wasn't respected. But he was watching the telly or something and he saw that New York had loads of them over there and they're all having a good time. Sure. Sorry. At no point in the song does Rod Stewart say little. Little gay Georgie was watching telly and saw loads of gays in New York. At no point in that song. No, but this is what I like about that song. You sort of picture what's going on. You make it up. Yeah. Okay. So the little gay fella was watching telly and there was a. There was a. Presumably the. That are now from New York, the gay show. Yeah. Or whatever. Because he was a big scene over there, weren't they, in the 70s? Yeah. Okay, go on. So he. He goes over there and he's having a great time and that. He went to New York town very quickly, settled down, soon became the toast of the great white wing. Yeah. They loved him. All the old queens blew a fuse. Yeah. Yeah. And then. I don't know, he was. He was out late one night. Yeah. And he's walking home. Yeah. And gets attacked, gets killed. And he's lying in the. They didn't intend to take his life. They just put their, like a little too far that night. Ye. Yeah. You see? So. Yeah, but what's good there is it Is it good that he had a bit of a good life and was able to be himself? Yeah. Or should he have stayed in Scotland? It didn't come from Scotland. Again. I. I really. I think. Is there any way we can get this song before the end of the show and play it? Because I've. I've heard it recently. A lot of people listening will have never heard this song. They wouldn't have any idea. Can I say what you said when we were talking about that song once before? Is it bad? It might. It might be because we're talking about, you know, Georgie boy, dinner. And he, you know, got it. I don't know what it's. When you said. Well, it's a fact. I don't think what he said. So it's Georgia. He gets out. He gets out, dies. Right? He goes, well, they do go out late. I know. Gay people. Gay people. And they start to party late on. That's what. In Soho. Right. Girlfriend got in a cab, right. Suzanne was in a cab and the cab driver was taking her to an early start. Right. She works at the BBC. Yeah. Early start. Four in the morning. It was going down. It was mental in. So at 4 in the morning. Yeah. They were all still like, start starting the night out. How'd you know? How's your guy? It's so well, isn't it? Fair enough. Okay. I'd love to be able to try and dig this out. Yeah, we will. This is Simon and Garfunkel, the only living boy in New York. It's. It's lovely. Only living boy in New York. Do you like that? It's got a nice feel to it. Simon a Garth uncle. Yeah, lovely. A bit later I'm gonna be playing the Cat Steven track. It's one of the most beautiful tracks ever written. It's called Lily White off Mona Bone, Jack on. Look forward to that. We've got Eminem coming up. We've had. We've got the new Eminem single as well. And a big giveaway. Rick, lest we forget. I think we should tell them what that is. Do you think? Yeah, well, we. We all went to the BAFTAs, as you know, and we thought we could get a good prize out of this. So we got some celebs. Yes. To sign the BAFTA bag they gave away. It's just a. It's just a nice big chunky sort of cardboard carrier bag, you know, it's not the value that counts. This is what values it. Read out the sort of names. These are the kinds of celebrity names that have Signed that bag, obviously. Us three, plus Graham Norton. Yeah. Angus Dayton signed it. Alan Davis, Jonathan Creek, Jamie Theakston, Paul Whitehouse. A lot of comedians. You'll notice Helen Baxendale from Cold Feet, who's also been in Friends. Right. I don't know why that's so exciting, Steve. Phil Mitchell. McFadden. Yeah. He's an eclectic bag. I noticed actually that Steve's signatures also mentioned. I think he says Steve, AKA Phil Mitchell, which is very nice of him. Yeah. Peter Davidson, former. Former doctor. I noticed also that when you gave him the pen to design it, he put the pen away. Yeah. He say just his wily cockney ways. You're not Phil Mitchell. Now give us the pen. Exactly. Simon. Peggy. And of course, one of broadcasting's biggest legends, Steve Wright. Oh, yeah. As well. Yeah, yeah. But that's, you know, you're not going to find that that's quite an eclectic and kooky mixture of celebrity names. Yeah. You know, autographs on one bag and. We maybe photocopy it and we can. Explain who they are, but we can give that away. And as you know, it's a little commemorative thing of the bafta. It's got a big BAFTA logo on there and everything. It's pretty classy. Did I mention this, that our agent who was there, he ran around getting a few of these autographs and I think he held him back. He went up to and told him it was for charity and that was why they signed it. Which I think's, you know, a little bit cheeky. But that's what agents are like, Carl, you've got. But then again, he didn't get anything from him. It's not like he said, give us a pound. No, he just got. When he said that as well. Exactly. But. So anyway, we're gonna give that away. Is that a good prize? I think that's a nice prize, isn't it? It's a little commemorative thing. No, it's. It's all right. I wouldn't want it. Oh, do people get you to sort of do campaigns on the radio, like Drink Fosters? I wouldn't, but, you know, you can. Look, I notice on the. The big board here, it tells us that this you can win signed and framed Chemical Brothers album covers on Sunday. Oh, that's just two geeks who've signed that. We've got like three alone in this room. Exactly. Plus we've got some of, you know, Britain's. The cream of Britain's light entertainment. Who signed that bag. I just kind of appalled by you that you're just so disrespectful of. It's like when. When I went to the baftas with you and I wasn't really enjoying it. So many people, you're like a little charity case. You're like, oh, I had chicks queuing. Up around the block. You'd usually have to. You did. Someone like you would have to write to Jim or fix it or as to Ransom to get to meet us sort of people. And now it's on your doorstep, amazed. That you didn't enjoy it. Why didn't you enjoy it? You got to walk down the red carpet. You went in there. Was George Best one of your footballing heroes. Was there a load of other big names? We. You sat there, prime position. You came backstage with load of other big names. Hey, you had a lovely bit of grub. You were filming this thing for the DVD we're making. That's you. That's you a cameraman on our dvd. And yet you think, oh, and, you know, you look grumpy because you had a couple of pints and you. Oh, I can't believe. So tell us why you didn't enjoy. Because the ceremony. What didn't you enjoy about that? It was interminable, wasn't it? Far too long, wasn't it? Awful. Boring. I'm sorry, I thought you're gonna say something really sorry. Three hours. Yeah. I mean, I suppose for you two at least. You know, you were gonna get something. Sure. Yeah. But with me, it's like. I mean, I've never graduated or anything, so. Have you not. I'm trying to think of a situation. Basically, I sat there for three hours knowing that I'm not gonna get anything out of the night. Yeah. Right. Now, did you. Sorry, when we invited you and you said yes, did you think you were enough for an award? I thought we were going to be sat round tables, having a nice bit of food. Yeah. Whilst people are going up there winning awards. But three hours of the same thing over and over again. I mean, if a film's three hours in the cinema. Yeah. You go, well, it's long, but, you know, I wonder how it's going to end. But this was just like the same thing over and over again. Some guy going up. Thanks a lot. Cheers for the bit of brass. And then going down, sitting down, the same thing over and over again. I wouldn't, honestly. Right. I'd say it was one of the worst things I've ever had to do. I enjoyed the night afterwards, when we did have a bit of Lamb and a nice bit of veg and that, that was all right. And I went home and I was happy and I got the, the little freebie bag that you're talking about that we give away, which wasn't much good stuff in it. Oh, all right. What would you have done on that Saturday night? What would you have done if. Or the Sunday night rather, what would you have done had at home? I would have stayed in with Suzanne, right. Watching telly, having a nice bit of pate on toast or something, cup of tea, watching 24. But instead I had to buy an expensive suit. So I didn't show you up. Right, yeah. How much did you spend on your suit? Well, in total, right. Cuz you know, the shoes and the suit and the shirt and the tie, it was about 600 quid. That's the most expensive evening ever. That's what I'm saying to you. And the daft thing is it's dark in there. I don't know why you've got to wear a nice suit. You can't wear a tracksuit for goodness. Dark in there. Not just the shirt and that. It doesn't make you a better person wearing a suit. No, it doesn't make a better person. No. We're not claiming it made you a better person. No, that annoyed me. Yeah. I mean it was an experience in it. That's why I went. Because you think if I didn't go, if I would have said to you when you invited me, no, Steve, I don't want to go, then I would have never known. Right. And I've, I've. That's my sort of thing in life, right. If something comes up, you should take it, even if you're not going to like it. It's a bit of an experience. Right. You know what he said to me? I phoned him up because we had to meet up and obviously he had to pose as my gay lover. Yeah, right, yeah. What do you said something to me like, I bought a suit, I'm looking good. He said, I'm looking good. People will think, how on earth did he end up with that good looking guy? So he got into the role. Such an inside record. I just must say that we've had an email from Darryl for. So many people have emailed and said, well done on the Baftas and well done on your room 101. They really liked it. Thank you. There's one guy, Daryl says, Ricky, has your dad only got 1D mob suit? Because I don't know if you noticed, but Ricky wears The same suit every single time he appears on tv because he spent a fortune on it, getting it tailored. I only got one. It's a good suit and I know all the time. And it's winter as well. It's like a pure wall, so I'm sweating everywhere I go anyway. Usually it's too much cheese. I'm buying another. Huh? I won't be buying another one ever. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. Suzanne told me today, right. Because I've gotten. I've handed it in today to have the trousers turned up a bit. Why? Because it was a bit of a badge job for the night. Yeah, right. It was just some pins sort of holding it up the other night. But you didn't notice. And I didn't tell you because I thought you'd be getting on the stage and saying, look at that freak over there with his pants end up. But I took it. I took it to the. To the plate to get it done. Suzanne tells me that I'm gonna start shrinking now. I'm getting to that age where you start going small. I know that that must have been a revelation to you and a worry like, how small do you get? How small do you get? Oh, what are we playing, then? I thought we'd have a bit of Marley music. Marley music. Oh, okay. Go on. Badly Drawn Boy. And something to about. Well, it's a good job we've got something to talk about because we're DJs on XFM. 104.9. Stephen Merchant. Go there. Carl Pil. How you doing? Of course, you must have been excited after us because we did bump into Dr. Fox. Oh, yeah. Pleased with that. Yeah. What was the challenge again? I think the challenge you had to shout Foxy. Yeah, the challenge was it's sort of like Jackass, but wimpy. Jackass. Carl was our cameraman for the night because we're doing the making of sort of series two where we've. We've filmed ourselves sort of writing it and doing bits and pieces and going to awards on it. And it's on me. And that. My challenge, which I think was it me that set my own challenge. I had to shout Foxy and get him over. Yeah. And I bottled out about five times. I just thought he was talking to someone. Yeah. I just thought. And then I did it. And where's the victory in that? I shouted foxy and he came over, went, all right, I think, where's the victory, Jack? As they dive off buildings and things. I was a little bit taken about that because Even though he was joking and mucking around, he was swearing. You don't expect that from Foxy. I'll be out. If he was. He was off duty. No, he was. I mean, he's more than wrong. But he didn't expect it to him because he. He seemed like a lovely bloke there. But he's got an enormous head. I mean, I'm not gonna. I'm not dis him. I think he's a lovely guy. But his head is huge. Proportion. With his big body as well. He's a big. He's a chunky wombat of a man. Enough. And so am I. It was problem getting him on. On screen. Sure. Because of the huge head. Yeah. I was struggling. No, well, I know the pop. Idle people have worries about that. I had to get special lenses. Yeah. Yeah. I love the fact that us three freaks can take anyone. Stop there, though, Rick, Because I was on TV briefly. There was a thing about the Office on Top 10 TV Bastards on Channel 4 and I appeared on there briefly talking about the show. And there's this girl who's a girlfriend of a friend of mine and she's. And she's. I saw you on TV last night. I went, yeah. She went, I'll tell you this, you're better looking on TV than you are in real life and that's good for you. And I want. I went. I was like, oh, I don't know if that was a compliment because it's like, definitely not. Well, I'm not on tv, so it's not beneficial in any way. Yeah, but that's right, you have to step out of the tv. That's like saying, I normally find you pretty repulsive. Yeah, I have my opinion changed slightly last night. Because you were on the box. Yeah. I didn't know. It sounded like it was through the. Aid of a different. Yeah, through the aid of lighting and appearing like for 12 seconds on screen. In small doses. She thought I wasn't as bad looking as I am. A lot of people have phoned in and wondered if you are Morph grown up because they've seen a picture of you on the website. Do you mean me or Carl? Carl. Right, yeah. What do you mean? No, because people have seen you next to a picture of Morph and it is exactly. If you draw. Honestly, Carl, if you lay you down and draw around you, it's exactly the same shape as Morph or the Pillsbury Doughboy or. Yeah. Gingerbread Man. You do look like a gingerbread man. That's great. Oh, I Love, Carl, we think you're brilliant. We'd like looking at you, talking to you, hearing what you've got to say. We think of you, don't we? In the week sometimes. Rick, I had a bit of good news this morning. Go on. And I don't mean this is. Anyway, I'm sure it's an emotional thing for her, but in the sun it says that Dido, her wedding's off. Right. Just thinking, ding dong. Because for some reason, I don't know what it is, I was having a chat with my mates. I've always been under the assumption I could pull Dido because she's. Because she's quite ordinary. Do you know what I mean? She looks a bit ordinary, she's quite unattractive. But like, would that be your opening chat up line? You look quite ordinary, Dido. I don't think you could probably get anything better than me. Yeah. Because you're not too hot yourself. Exactly. My name's Steve Merchant. I'd wear it, actually. What I'd do is I'd go, right, I'm not going to meet you in the flesh but I'm going to send a video on video. Yeah. This is me on Top TV Masters. What do you think? See what you think. Yeah. And if you think it's good. Well, I'm certainly no worse without the lighting and makeup, so don't worry about that. Exactly. Oh. What was your thing about Dino? That she's like a kind of. She's a bit like a receptionist who. Got up and sang once because she's. And a bloke came up. Hi, I'm Gridling Records. I'm thinking of releasing the CD and it just goes mental. Exactly. Everyone buys it. Yeah. Which is good though, innit? But she should be doing photocopying or filing. Do not think. Just the way she looks. She's got a very kind of suburban look. Thing annoys me. Do you know there's another pop stars thing starting, right. It's going on in. In Ireland, apparently. It's Ireland's version of it. Okay. And today it was like you saw all these kids rushing in. There was fat ones there and ugly kids and you're thinking it's sad and everything. They might have a good voice but there's no chance. Right. And there was a woman there who looked a bit like Brittany. And the bloke straight away, before even hearing the voice. Brittany look alike over there. Go and get her in, give her a ticket, she's through to the next phase and it's just Annoying. Dido isn't beautiful, but she's nice enough. Do you know what I mean? Well, yeah, that's why she's fine for me. I mean, you know, I mean, my standards are quite lonely. So do you think Steve should go out there, then? I mean, that's what we're asking you. Do you think he should? Yeah. Okay, let's have a little bit about. We. Thanks, Car. Try and fix that for next week. Passion. David Bowie. We're doing a bit of. A Bit of voguing, sort of cross with body popping there, weren't we, Carl? Yeah, played that last night, Rick, during the set. Yeah. That was described by Zane Lowe as one of the best sets he's ever seen. No, no, no, but I. I think Zane just sent the email and said he's giving up because there's no point. Yeah, exactly. When he hears stuff like that. He said, I thought I was a dj. I've seen Steve version. I'm obviously not exactly. Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, Big Boy Jim was down there. Yeah, Big Boy Jim was going, well. You know, I don't know what I'm thinking. Yeah, but I like the idea because, you know, Fat Boy Slim did Brighton beach, didn't he? And he had like 20, 000 people in Brighton Beach. Yeah, everyone was loving it. Just the idea of me dating Western Super Mare. Doing the same with the donkeys. 86 people. Have you ever seen. Have you ever seen that karaoke challenge on Challenge tv? Yeah, it's great. They're all doing it and it's sort of like Jonathan, what's his name from Brad, and all those sort of people there and the camera falls out and there's about eight people there. But what I love about karaoke Challenge is it's not even Night Fever. Can you imagine that? I mean, talk about. Wow. Oh, dear. We tried to get on that once. Didn'T we, on Karaoke Challenge. Yeah, we were doing that comedy. We were doing character. Yeah, we'd do it. Yeah, it's David Bowie. So we'd have a little bit of footage, but. Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah, you wouldn't even let that. That was how minor a celebrity you were at the time. I remember once, right, this is how sad we were. We tried for about an hour to get on the Chris Moyle Show. They were doing a competition. He was doing this competition. It was about golf, wasn't it? So it was like things with. It was. No, it was. Yeah, it was. You had to think of a song title. Yeah, you have to make it into a golfing pun and people calling up. And going, now, what about drive by the cars? He was going, drive by the cars. Very good. And it was like things like, you know, I mean, things like something tea and that. And I wanted to phone up and go, hello, yeah, you know, what about Spanda Valley Golfy Golfing. Just me and I was just. We tried, we must about 30 quid just to get on and do something stupid, help us. And they wouldn't even let us on. What were the others? It's a good game, Matt. Well. Oh, God. Phone in if you've got any amusing puns on songs and golf. Yeah, please. What did you say? What was it? I spanned out. Party. Gophy. Gophy. Yeah. Do you like that one? It's a good, good little game. Yeah, you're thinking. You're thinking of what you're doing, Carl, what you're thinking on the radio. That's what you're doing. It's a first. You're actually broadcasting. Thinking. Can we just be quiet and just listen to Carl think? Yeah. Oh, anything? Got anything there? Any golfing puns? You know, people say, carl, it's impossible to catch yourself not thinking now, I reckon if there's one man in the world. Hole in my shoe, that fella and the young ones hole. And he's one on a golf course, he's got. He's got a little. Has you got a little cold as well? Because you're. Well, I was telling Steve before I went on the tube last Saturday night. Yeah. Kills me. There's. There's. Every time I go on a tube, I just get full of a cold and everything. I'm full of flu and it's down to going on the tube. Is it? Someone told me that every time you go on the tube it's equivalent to smoking two cigarettes. Really? Because of the sort of gunk and pollution down there. And have you heard the other one? And, and, and I always smoke two cigarettes on the tube. Yeah. Because of my nerves. Yeah. What's the name one about the. Oh, yeah, all the. All like the hair balls that are in the tubes of like people stood on the platform. Trains go whizzing past at high speeds. Yeah, right. Takes a bit of your hair off. Don't say anything. What you mean don't question the science of that. No, he means because it doesn't affect it. Oh, I see, yeah. Yeah. Right. And apparently they all get caught up in the. In the tunnels and they have to like clean it out now and again because there's Big hairballs on the. On the lines, on the lions, on the train lines. Right. Yeah. It's a terrible place. So that's why I'm all bunged up. And that's when you came in today. I was like looking on the websites to see how much badness there is down in the tubes. Yeah. How much badness is there? Oh, loads. Is there a lot of badness? If you know how much badness there is on the tube. Calling no. 871-234. How much badness is there? It was just about, you know, the germs. There's no fresh air. And that's why I was asking you about people committing suicide on trains and how often it happens. And apparently two people a week. Was it two a week or two a week? Two cigarettes. How many people is it? Two people? 700, 800, 1234. How many people per cigarettes? Is it like killing yourself on the tube? Call in two people a week, try and kill themselves or something. Right. On the tubes, really? Yeah. It is terrible. Should we play a record? If you want. We got the big new M M single. No, I was gonna. I was. We'll tease them with that. We'll play that a bit later. We are gonna play it, though. We're gonna play the new M single. We will. Plus, of course, obviously, we've got this big celebrity bag to give away as well. Oh, yeah. Let me just do a quick. The competition after that. Doves, doves, Be good doves. There goes the fear on XFM 104.9. Now, Steve, I know you're keen for us to play the new Eminem single. Absolutely. Can I. Can I. I want to play, you know, some adverts first, though, because I just. I think you should hear about these products and just consider I'm keen to buy. Got a bit cash and buy some. Of these things and we'll play Eminem straight. Okay? All right. Yeah. Eminem without me on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchanthe. Hello there, little Carl Pilkington into the last hour. Three hours of broadcasting to go. Kyle, for us three, yeah. What, you three musketeers? Because you'll obviously still be working here. You have a day job, don't you? What is it you do exactly? I make stuff. You make stuff? What, like furniture promos and stuff? All right, right, right. Sort of a bit of in talk there, but basically like little trails for the station. Yeah, yeah. That's what I do all week. Yeah. So you'll be back to doing that when we're off. You don't talk to anyone, do you, in the week? You just hide in your little sound booth thing and. You really don't talk to anyone, do you? Much, not really, no. I mean, you, you know, you might call up. Yeah, but now I keep myself to myself. Yeah. Then you don't get bogged down in the office politics and stuff. Yeah. Is there a lot of office politics here? I don't know. I don't get involved in it. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Proved your point. So. So when we're away and we're, like, out of action, other than Suzanne, who will you talk to of a day? How will you get a sort of feedback from the world? How? You get sort of like input. And I always. If I've ever. If ever I've got like a. A question on anything, the Internet sat there and I can just go on online and find out. The Internet is. Is good. It's brilliant. But it's not all verified. What do you mean it's not all verified? It's not all factually, necessarily factually accurate. Anyone can put things onto the Internet. It's that, you know, that's. It's. It's freaks and things that. Pot on. Well, things like. Here's one that I read in the Week about this woman, yeah, she was a bit of a punk. And to get her hair done like she wanted it. Super glue, right? No, she got lard. Apparently, it's a popular thing. You might, you might know, put loud on your head. Yeah. And you put it in the oven. Now, apparently the heat that you get from the oven is different from the sort of heat you get from an air dryer, right? And she had to do that to get the style that she wanted. But anyway, she comes into money or whatever, treats herself to a microwave, right? It doesn't. It's not true. Opens the door, jams the things, you know, like the little catch. So. So the microwave works. She jams it with a screwdriver or a knife or something. Yeah. Puts the microwave on, sticks her head in, boils her brain. Don't be ridiculous. Right, well, why is that ridiculous? Boils her brain. She boiled her brain. She boiled her brain. This is what's good about the Internet. I went straight from that. And there was a subject about brains. And do you know that Russell Crowe, when he dies, is. Is given his. His brain to charity or something? Some sort of. Some people who can do stuff with it. She gave hers to Pot Noodle. Vesta. Yeah. Oh, boy. In the skull. Yeah. That's. That's not true. It's not true, Carl. It's the same as the woman who put her poodle in the microwave, isn't it? And all that. Just urban myths. They're urban myths. But again, where does it start? Someone made it up. Yeah, for a laugh. They're just too convenient. Urban myths, everyone said. You can tell. Nervous? Not really. Good, because it's always this happened to a mate of mine and. And when you say what happened? Then they go, don't know. That was it. Was it? Was that it? Was it someone. Boulder brain. And that was it. There was no more story. Were there any dates? I think it was in Belgium. There's that, there's that, there's that, there's that one. That a bloke, right, was gonna get a phone call at 4:00 to find out if his business was, you know. Okay, right. And if, if he didn't get the phone call, he knew he was broke, destitute. So dead on, 4:00, the phone didn't ring. So he went up to the. The roof, his office, and he jumped off to commit suicide. And as he was passing his window, the phone was ringing. Oh no. Carl. It didn't happen. Didn't happen. Think it through. Think it through. Who, who, who told that story? Who told that story as he hit the pavement at 120 miles an hour? He's the only person who could have known those. That series of incidents also. Why, as his life's at stake, why didn't he wait till five past? I certainly give it five minutes, just in case. In case the lines are busy. Yeah. And this. And what sort of. What sort of bloke goes out? I'll call you at 4, okay? If your business. Well, call me anyway. No, no. If I don't call exactly four, then. No, you commit suicide. Commit suicide. I would. Because if I don't call it four, that's the end of it. Well, call me anyway. No, that's not the way I work. Why can't you just call me and tell me other way? Well, I'm telling you, I would do it if you're bust. I don't call. Can't you just call to verify in case something goes wrong? What if it's engaged? He'd want to be engaged. Just commit suicide at four, please. It's. It didn't happen, Carl. Have you had the other one? Right, a bloke, right, he's on a train station and I'll tell You how I heard it. He's. He's waiting for a crew station and he shits himself, as you do. And so he goes, oh, my train's five minutes, I need. So he runs across to Millets and goes, quick, Levi's 36. The bloke just puts it in a bag. He runs onto the train, it goes into the toilet. Takes his trousers and pants off. He's soiled. Yes. Throws them out of the window. I won't be needing those again. Cleans himself off. Open the bags. It's a jacket. No, he didn't have the Carl. At what point did he go into it? Go, go. Quick. Levi's 36. And the bloke went, sorry, Levi's 36, what a pair. No, no. Shall I wrap them? Them? It. It. Shall I wrap. Just wrap whatever it is. Do you want to look? No, I'm not looking. When you're putting it in the bag, please. Right, well, 36. Wife's doing so well. Not. Don't say anything. I've told you, 36 Levi's. They put it in a bag and charge me for it. Yeah. I don't want to discuss it further. Yeah, there was one. There we go. There's one about a woman who's husband died and she had him cremated. Yeah. And made. Made like a little egg timer out of him. And she said, I did that. So it can still help around the kitchen. Well, that might be true. That might be a joke. That's quite sweet. That might be true. True story again. It was all. No, not again. Because the ones I just told weren't. Nor is the boiling the brains in a bag curry, microwave head story true. Yeah, they're too. They're too convenient. Will you be buried or cremated? What? Will you be buried or cremated? I don't know by cremated. I've. I don't know. It's out of my hands. Yeah. I haven't thought about it. Not thought it through and I don't care either way. Have you heard the one? So each. Sorry, I'm just worried that we're getting into a macabre world now of ashes, boiled heads. I think we should play some music that people just calm down, Levi's. Just think about some of the urban myths they've maybe heard. Assess them maybe. They are absolute bollocks. Yeah. And they can move on from it. It's just that the death thing. Right. Yeah. There was an argument on there about. Do you know that Twilight Zone or whatever it was, Tales of the Unexpected. Oh, yeah. Where the woman Got buried alive. Yeah. They were saying how like years ago they bury people thinking they're dead. Yeah. And they've. They've recently like dug coffins up and then the people who were in the coffin weren't dead. They might have just been like in some sort of deep sleep or whatever. And they've lifted the lid off. Yeah. And there's scratch marks on the thing. Yeah. And that's pretty scary. Makes you think. I mean, I hope they check these days. That's all. I'd like to play a beautiful song now by Cat Stevens called Diddy White. It's lovely. A song for the lovers room. Yeah. The Big Cell Lily White by Cat Stevens off Mona Bone Jack on album I as lovely. But I'd rather have. I'd rather have some more ads now. I'd love some commercials, man. We have some of that and coming after that, we'll explain how you can win this celebrity endorsed bag. Also White van Carl and some more chat. Lovely. Please. Cooper Temple clause there. Who needs enemies on XFM 104.9. Well, it's competition time if you want that celebrity. Celebrity endorsed bag from the baftas. Jane has a good idea. She thinks we should revive sort of. Swap Shop because I think it's a great game. It's great. It was great. Right. But a competition or just saying why you need it. Right this way, you know, it's how much you can give and I think it should be right. What will endorse Carl's life? A theme of the last. The season. I suppose this is. We're ending a season now of this. Of this show, aren't we? And one of the big themes is, is really develop Carl, rejuvenate him in some way. What do you think Carl would want? If you've got something he'd love, it can be battling tops, you know, and you got to say why he'd love your old battling tops. It can be a book. Sorry, what's up? What's a battling top? Was this something you used to take to school, like with your hoop? No, it was a little potato. It was in the wrist action and it was like little tops, right. You'd have four players, right. You'd spit and wind it around like a cotton, right. And hold a little. I'm getting excited thinking about it. I don't know what you're talking about. No, I know I'm getting over excited. It was just battling was this something. And you pull it. Yeah. And it goes mad. Don't send one of them. I've had one. Don't give any clues. It can be some educational. It can be somewhat personal to you that you think it might enhance. So the competition is basically, if you want that bag. So let's just explain what the bag is. It's these. One of these cardboard giveaway bags that we got at the baftas. It's got a nice picture of the BAFTA logo. We got it signed by Graham and Norton. Angus Dayton, Alan Davis, Jamie Theakston, Paul Whitehouse, Helen Baxendale, Steve Phil Mitchell McFadden, Simon Pegg, Steve Wright. Obviously, the three of us. And, you know, this is a nice little sort of, you know, if you like kind of autographs or if you're an autograph hunter or whatever else, or you just like the bag. Oh, you like the show, you know, a little piece of car or you want to give Carl something, a bit of yourself or to enhance his life. Let's get it straight. So it's something that you have. It doesn't have to be very expensive, doesn't have to be necessarily a worthy thing you've made. Carl. Carl has to go. I want that. Something that enhances Carl's life in some way. Something that will make his life a little bit more special, a little bit better. Yeah. And this is a right or email only. We don't want your phone calls on this because we're just too lazy. What could make Carl's life a little bit more special? And we'll give it away next week. So you've got a week to. To email or write in with your suggestions about what it is that you'd want to swap for this, this celebrity. Is it carlxfm.co.uk yeah. Or you can write XFM PA Box 1049, London WC2H 7XX. Yeah, give up. Give them out again. Rick. Sorry. You ought to maybe mention something like, you know, Gervais bag. Oh, I. I think. I think Carl Swap shop. Carl Swap shop. Or. Well, let's not confuse it. Well, it's just good to have a good name. Okay, what are you thinking? Is this gonna take as long as. The golfing on radio again? Is this thinking on radio again? All right, all right, we'll just do that. So hang on, it can't just be Carl@XFM, is it not Carl Dot Pilkington. Yeah, with a K. But the thing is, why are they emailing me? Because I'm not taking any bribes. They've got to send the stuff in. No, no, no, no, of course they haven't. 100 people send some and you send 99 back. No. Oh, yeah, I see what you mean. They just email or write you a suggestion. Make sure that you mention who you are if you're emailing. And leave a telephone number as well. We need a telephone number. We've got to call you back. Let me give you an example. I like the bag. I want the bag. Right. I think this would enhance Carl's life because I am sending a feng shui book, something like that. You know what I mean? I am sending Carl a teddy bear. You have to explain why, though, obviously. Why you think it isn't. You know, it's so much more complicated than you need to. It was such an easy idea. Throw the bag. We'll burn the bag. Give out the addresses again. Bag. Okay. It's XFM, PO Box 1049. That's easy to remember. London WC2H 7XX. And the email. I can't remember. Carl.pilkingtonxfm.co.uk with a K. With a K. All right. Well done. Yeah. Man alive, that was exhausting. What would you like? What would you like? I really don't know. I. Honest to God, I can't. I can't help anyone out here. You just see something you like when you see it. Well, it might be something out there that I don't know about. And yet it is. I'm sure there is. I'm sure there's some out there you don't know. There's things in this room you don't understand. Okay, look, we played it before once. And I know you're a child. Yeah. I'm a big fan of this. This is from Amy Mann's album Bachelor Number Two. And this is Red Vines. It's beautiful. I do. I know. Carl's not impressed as ever. I don't know what your criteria for music appreciation is at all. It's just that you build them up as being something really good. And then I hear it and it's like. I don't know what it is that you're expecting to hear. What do you mean to say? What are we meant to say? Oh, this is all right. When you played Simon and Garth Uncle. Yeah. They've got their own unique sound. You know, it's them when they sing. Yeah. That could have been loads of women who. I know. It could have been loads of women who, you know. You only know your girlfriend. What? I mean, Cheryl Crowe sounded like Cheryl Crow to me. Yeah, but we're only superficially. But man's been around longer than Crow. Who knows what you Know influences she may have had. That sounds like a favor, doesn't it? Man's been around longer than Crow. Hey, but you see, no, I mean that's just, you know, there's a number. Let's be honest, I mean there's not that many great female artists, are there? Oh, hey, be careful there, Steve. Some of the, the sisters out there will be disagreeing with you. I'm not saying that they can't sing a beautiful song. I'm just worried they can't write the material. I'm thinking, I'm thinking of Bush. I'm thinking of. Aren't we all Rick? I'm thinking of armor trading. That's true enough. I am thinking. Anastasia. Anastasia. I know you love Anastasia, don't you? You love one. I love that new one. I, I mean I don't like sounds like the other two, but it sort of. There's a good chorus and I can, I can do her dance. That dance at the end when she puts her arms up. She does sound like she's a. Coverage the new Tina Turner. Yeah. And me and Steve think that she's sort of like one of those people that go out with her daughter. Well, I think the reason is because if you notice, she always wears sunglasses. Yeah. And I'm sure that she's. Because she claims to be something like 28. I bet she's like 40. It's like one of those 40 year old women who come from Essex but they come at their daughters 21st and they're going, your mum's mad. Yeah. They think we're sisters. They're not. You know, I'm 40 and she's 21. She always flirts with her daughter's boyfriend. Yeah. Where are you going? We're going down. We're going down millionaires. Your mum's got her bra off. Yeah. Don't you think she looks like that, Carl? Yeah. I can't picture her. You can't picture Anastasia? No. She wears glasses, sunglasses all the time. Yeah. You're not into this, are you, Carl? This whole sort of broadcast thing has just. You're fed up with it, aren't you? You can't wait to finish next week. Well, it just seems I can't say anything right. Why? Whatever I say isn't right or funny. No, but do you know what I mean? What? Cause. What are you upset about? Well, I laugh at the urban myth. They're not being true. Yeah. And but one of the things I'll tell you that if, if you take nothing else away from our time on the radio, it should be to be more inquisitive. When a piece of information comes to you, don't just take it at face value, query and question it. That is what has made Ricky Gervais one of the premier thinkers in this country. He will not accept anything on face value. He queries everything. Anastasia, she looks glamorous and 20. Wait a minute. Those glasses. What do they suggest? Actually, she's 40. I'm not going to buy her records. And that's. And that's libelous. That's potentially labelers. So hang on a minute. Roy Orbison, then. Was he starting to look old? We're not saying everyone who wears sunglasses is necessarily older than their years. No, we're not even saying about Anastasia. We're just doing about an image. One of those sort of like ravers that goes to their daughter. It was just. It was a lot. It was a little bit of light observational comedy, to be honest. Carl, you've seen through it, mate. Yeah. Toilet to shred. She's not 40, you know what I mean? She doesn't hang out round with much younger people chatting at their boyfriends. It wasn't true. What are you. What do you want? What do you want in life, Carl? Tell me now, because me and Steve can probably sort it out. That is true enough. Come on, what do you want? What would you. What's the best thing? If you could play any song now, what would it be? Well, we're gonna be spinning one of my favorites later on. Killing a Georgie. We sorted that out. You've probably got a lovely few gifts you can choose from. Just. Just because we got a few signatures on a piece of paper. Do you know what I mean? What. What more do you want out of life? I always find that. Do you want a cat? You want a cat, don't you? It's the things that you don't think you're gonna get that you enjoy the most. Right, go on. Like what? No, well, like when you go out for a night and you're expecting just to have a simple little drink and it turns out to be a really nice night, you see people you haven't seen for ages. Yeah. Now the BAFTAs. So sort of, you expect so much. He's having a go and he. That when you get there, you get that little bit of veg as a starter and you think, look at it. They've tried to make it look good, but really, as I said to you, I mean, you don't eat veg, which I find is mental, but like the starter that we had, that was like. How would you describe that? It was a veg pie. It was like, I thought from the. From the. I was starving when I came in there, right? And from the stairs, I could see the tables, and it looked like there was pate laid out. And I was getting excited. I was salivating, got there. It was a vegetable pie. I answered to Steve, vegetable pie. Okay? Someone took mine. It was vegetable. The White House took mine, didn't he? Yeah, but, Rick, you won't eat anything. We've discussed this before. All you'll eat is pizza and crisps. Do you know what he said to me in the Week? I was picking up my food in the BBC canteen? And he went, right, I'm honestly thinking of stopping having lunch with you. I went, what? He went, it winds me up. I went, what? He said, it winds me up. It winds me up. You won't eat anything. That's a lovely bit of chicken there. You're not eating that. You're not eating that. It winds me up too much. Like, you get irritated by people noise. I said, you eating it just winds me up, Gervais. And then he went, you're a. Yeah. It really annoyed me. His eating habits drive me mad because he's constantly whinging about the fact that he thinks he's got cancer every 25 seconds. Wait a minute. I got. I can feel a lump. I can feel it. Lump. It's your. No, it's. It's not. It wasn't there before. It wasn't there. It's a lump. It's a lump. I'm dying. I'm dying. I'm dying. Quick. To the hospital. I have been. How many times have you been to, like, a doctor's clinic and sat in the waiting room? Right, come on. How many times have you been there, right, with a friend of yours? Twice. I've been with Ricky. One time when we were writing the first years of the office, we were writing in the. In the waiting room for the doctor because you had to go in there and have his. Because he thought he had testicular cancer. I swear to God. And I just said, so I never worry about that again. He said, no, you're not in. The other time was. But wait a minute. The other time was I thought I had a stomach cancer. And I went. She went, well, I said, oh, God. He said, when you get a sore throat, do you think you've got throat cancer? I said, I have thought that, yeah. And she sort of like. She sort of said, get out of Here, you idiot. And that's what I like. I like that when they do that. But I think it's sort of since my mum died of it, and I just think, oh, God, it's in the family. And that's. That's the thing I worry about. Don't you prefer. I mean, I don't go because it scares me. Yeah, I'm like that. Prefer not to go because he might. I always worry that, especially with cancer and things, that they'll go, you know, I'll go there with a sore leg or something, and they'll go, no, your leg's fine. But look at this we've found in your head. If it's your brain, you'll be laughing. No, but you know what I mean. They'll find something because none of us are perfect. And as you get older, you get little moles and stuff and they'll say, oh, we best get rid of that. And it's like, leave it alone. It's not causing any problems. Imagine arguing. That shouldn't be there. Leave it alone. It's not good. It is. It's getting bigger and it's strangling your lungs. But Rick's sort of like, oh, it's. But my point was that this is what upsets me. He constantly worries about his health. He's constantly obsessed. I found some bubos. I think I've got plague. Every single. I mean, every 10 minutes, he's got something. I started choking once. There was some dust, didn't I? Yeah, he swallowed some dust. He started choking like he'd swallowed a fishbone, Right? He was literally. I thought he was gonna die. And he panicked and he shouted, right, I'm choking. I'm going blue. And I'm trying to hit me. And he's hitting me on the back and he shouted, I don't know the Heinlich maneuver. And I was choking and dying. But then I wanted to laugh because he panicked going, it's like, if he's gonna die, I want him to know that I didn't know the Heinlich maneuver. I did everything I. I did everything I could, but I didn't know the Heimlich maneuver. So that was why I couldn't have saved him. But my point is this. He worries about his health and yet he eats like a child. He eats crisps, constantly Coke. He keeps going, I've got a headache. I've got a headache. Drink some water. Yeah, no, no, boring. Hate it. I did say that. Yeah. Chips, pizza. Sausages. Sausages, beans and chips. I've never seen someone eat so much sausage. I don't know how he's not bored of it yet. Sausage, chips and beans. Everything that's got cheese on it. Parmesan cheese, please. You know, on anything. Why do they leave it in a restaurant as well? Seriously, why don't they leave the Parmesan cheese? It's like it's gold dust or something. As much salt as you want. But they. They come along and I. I found myself sneaking. I've said to Jane, look out, there's the way looking. And I've lent over and did some more Parmesan. I feel really guilty. Just leave it. It was on a trifle. You don't need cheese on dessert. I've explained it to you. Oh, dear. So this is what. This is why I get angry. And that is why I got. And this is. I'll tell you this. What if I had to be on. I mean, Ricky was on room 101. If I had to be on there. I'll tell you this. Ricky Gervais. Be the first person in there. Maybe straight in there, man. Because I got a list as long as. What did you think when I said annoying people? Like mate making noise. Unbelievable. So you talked about. Yeah, annoying noises and that. People that make annoying noises that are annoying. He is the most irritating man I've ever met. I swear to God. I don't mean that as an insult. You really are. Because you go out of your way to be insulting and irritating. Thanks, that's fine. You know, but you'd be straight in there. Yeah. We should do this next week for Carl. We should. We should draw up a list of Carl's hates. What he'd put in room 101. Oh, that. Think about that next week. That is genius. Next week. So we got the competition. We've got Carl. I'll tell you what. Let's play a record and do White Van Car. Yeah, somewhat. And just let's slam dunk this mother. That's true enough. What are you gonna play tomorrow? Stars. Okay. Alpine Stars. Carbon Kid, featuring little Brian from placebo. Oh, yeah. Thought I recognized him. Yeah. So like that, right? White Van Carl. White van Carl. Yeah. This is where we steal the White Van man column from the sun and basically fire those questions at Carl getting his opinions on the week's news. Okay, Carl, let me see, let me see, let me see. Okay. What do you make of this? The average woman apparently takes 27 minutes to get ready to go out. Do you know that? Is it. Are they saying that's. That's a good thing or. No, they're saying that the bare minimum it makes. No, this is surely. No, no, but I remember reading. I'm sure they said that it takes them 27 minutes to get ready to go. At the very least, it's not that. Bad if it's for a night out, it's that. I mean, 30 minutes is all right. If it's going to get to 20 Woodbines, but. Yeah. Or, you know, if the house is on fire and it's like, quick, yeah, get ready and get out. I don't. I don't think it's in a. In a fire. No. Yeah, go on. I think 20. That's 27 minutes. I take about 27. It can take up to that. But do they include the getting up and having a bath? Doesn't give me any more details. No. 27, that's difficult to go by. Difficult to go on that one. How long does Suzanne take to go out the house? Depends. Like I say, if we. If we're just nipping out shopping, the. Old flip flops and trackies on. Yeah, but if you're going out for the night, it takes a bit longer, doesn't it? Yeah, yeah. You got wiring the flip for your track is. Yeah, yeah. Come on. Okay. Okay. No, really don't know what the ins and outs of this story are. Is Van Gorn Erickson sticking with Nancy rather than. Ulrike was his wife and that was girlfriend. Yeah. I don't know if this story's true. No one seems to have offered any. Evidence for it anyway. Everyone remains silent. Rubbish. And okay, what do you make of this? David Beckham apparently was driving despite having an injured foot and just further threatening his World cup chances. Obviously you're a big football fan. Well, I'm not that big. I like. I like the odd game. Sure. Would that hurt his foot? It can be good. Is it in a plaster? Sure. It's better to drive than it is to walk on it. Good point. Fair enough. Yeah. Cool. Can't argue with it. The boss, can he? Okay. And what do you make of this fascist leader who's having a lot of success in the French presidential elections? What's he doing? Have you not. You've not come across this story? No. Right. This is one of the big, big political stories. He's got a far right that got nearly 20%. He's a far right fascist leader and he's having considerable success in the French elections. I don't think we should be asking hard questions like this. I'm Getting scared. There's all sorts of bad stuff going on in the world that we don't know about. Yeah, but we know about this. You're better off not knowing because there's nothing I can do about it. You're absolutely right, Carl. I can't argue with that. Oh, fantastic. That is brilliant. Have we got. Have we got it lined up? It's the one song I've been wanting to play since we've been on xfm. Really? And took me a while to track it down, obviously in the XFM library. But here it is. Give Me Shelter from the Rolling Stones. It's amazing track. Give Me Shower from the Rolling Stones. Surely if there was a soundtrack to the Vietnam War that would be on there, wouldn't it? Can I just reiterate this, this giveaway then? We got this bag signed by a number of celebrities, Graham Norton, Angus State and different people on there. And if you want to win that, then you have to email or write in with what you are willing to swap. Okay? So you need to swap something and something that's. Which will enhance Carl's life. It can be anything. You could have made it, you could have bought it, anything you. But you have to have it. You can send it to us in exchange for this, this signed bag and you can email carl.carl.pilkington. carl with a K. Carl.pilkingtonxfm.co.uk or you can write to the bag or Ricky Gervais's. I just realized what I've been saying. Car with a K. Because you can have car with a C, can't you? Yes, you can. As in Cox. Absolutely. Oh, you can write to XFM, P.O. box 104.9. 104.9 10. 149 London WC2H7 double X. All right. Okay. All right. Well, it's gonna be a bit of a change, isn't there? Yes, that's absolutely right. Normally we would sign the show obviously with a song for the ladies, but. Because it's sort of Carl's penultimate show and we're playing one of his favorite tracks. What you're gonna. Yeah, I just thought we could play this. It is obviously the. The Killing of Georgie by Rod Stewart. By Rod Stewart. And this is a song for the gays. Oh, yeah. In these days of changing ways so called liberated days A story comes to mind A friend of mine. Georgian boy. Ms. Gayakis nothing more, nothing less the kindest guy I ever knew his mother's tears fell in vain in the afternoon George tried to explain that he needed love like all the rest. Power says there must be a mistake. How can my son not be straight after all I've said and done for him? See, his father took it as a sort of personal slight. But you can't help it, you know. And as he said, you know, he's just gay. Doesn't make him a nasty person. Not at all. Leaving home Monica Hound Cast out by the ones he loves A victim of these gay days it seems. Are you enjoying this car? Yeah, but I'm not gay. No evidence of me being Scottish. No. But. Went to New Yorktown where he quickly settled down and soon became the toast of the Great White Way. Accepted by Manhattan to leave in all the places that were sheep no party was complete without George. Along the boulevard tea crew and all the old queens blew a fews. Everybody loved George. When he says they blew a fuse if they're not electricians, they mean he sort of. It's sort of. And it's not a euphemism either. The last time I saw George alive was in the summer of 75. He said he was in love. I said I'm pleased. George attended the opening night of another Broadway hyper split before the final curtain fell Deciding to take a show called Home. On and on they meant no wrong. A channel of breeze blew down fifth Avenue. Oh, I'm worried I'm a bit edgy. He's out late. I know. And he's taken a shortcut which is mental. Not in New York City. Yeah, he doesn't know the area. He's from Scotland. Out of a dark inside street came a New Jersey gang with just one aim to roll something ascent passerby. There ensued a fearful fight. Screams rung out in the night George's head hit a sidewalk cornerstone. I bet it was them that were screaming. Yes, a leather kid. A Swiss blade knife did not intend to take his life. He just pushed his luck a little too far. That night the side of blood dispersed again. A crowd gathered, the police came, an ambulance screamed to a halt or 53rd reserve. I'm suddenly worried. This isn't a true story, is it? Who knows if it is? We don't know that. Just what let's say that we're not. Oh, that'll be terrible. Yeah. George's life and it failed. But I asked who really cares? George once said to me and I. He said never wait or hesitate. Get in, give before it's too late. You may never get another chance. Cuz youth's a mask but it don't last. Live it long and live it fast Georgie was a friend of mine. See. How come you think this might be a true story? I just. I just got suddenly worried then. No, but how come, how can this be a true story? But the bloke jumping out of a window and hearing his phone ringing. No, because Rod Stewart. I just suddenly thought, what if he's written a song about this and this bloke did actually exist and was killed? Then I started panicking. Yeah, I don't think it is, is it? I'm almost certain it's not. Okay, sell it then. Is that it? Then? We. We got to pack up and go home. Yeah, well, I think we've enjoyed ourselves. I've loved it. I've loved every minute of it. Carl.pilkinson@xfm.co.uk for your suggestions as to what you're willing to swap for the signed bag. See you next week by.",
