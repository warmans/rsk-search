Good to see you, Carl. Good to see you, Ricky. Cheers. Cheers. Now, in a. In a fun filled, a music filled show, we've got music and fun. Yes, Looking forward to that. Two hours solid. Two hours. No gaps. There's nothing. There'd be no dead air. There will be adverts sometimes. Yeah. But I mean, you know that that's what's what pays our wages, isn't it, really? And some of the adverts, I think are quite amus. Yes, no, the ones that you're on. Yeah. We've got our Hip Hop Challenge. We've got Song for the Lover, Song for the Ladies. We've got a film review. So. Magnificent. Had any calls about that, Rick? Any maybe Channel 5 or someone onto you? No, they haven't, no. That's strange. That's weird. I think it's a bit ahead of itself because it's very unique. Sure. Is it? It's sort of like it's a bit. A bit out there. Anything caught your eye this week, Steve? I know that both you and I are kind of obsessed with these people who believe in, you know, people who can predict the future or have contact with the dead or whatever. And I know Mystic Meg's a bit of a nonsense, but people do take her seriously. On the COVID of the sun today, mystic meg won me 15 million quid. Wow. Right, you're thinking, that's not. That's a pretty amazing claim. I know that Carl believes in Mystic Meg and all that sort of rubbish. You know, you're thinking, wow, here at last, is proof that she has got powers. And you wonder yourself, well, maybe she predicted the numbers specifically, you know, that. That would be a hell of a. Just to him. Yeah. Which is incredible. Which is actually incredible. And so this is Guy Lottery Mad Tom Naylor, he's a lorry driver. Right. He won 15 million quid. He says, I always read my horoscope in the sun and follow the advice. Basically what Meg said was, keep a lottery ticket in a yellow mug to add luck. So you're thinking, well, okay, so he's kept his ticket in a yellow mug. That's still pretty extraordinary. Yeah. I didn't have a yellow mug, says Tom. So I put the pages of my map book. So I put the ticket in the pages of my map book, which is Yellow. Right. He's used. He's used the yellow. No, he's used the yellow. Yeah. I don't know much about how Mystic Meg works. I'm assuming maybe there's some kind of pseudoscience that she applies. Yeah. I think if she'd said put it near anything yellow, fine. Yeah. She said put it in a yellow mug. That's pretty specific. Yeah. From that, he's thought, well, I'll ignore Meg's advice. I always do what she says. If she says put it in the. Yellow mug, she's had two sort of like, you know, points of reference there. The description, the yellowness of the object and the object itself. The noun should be a mug. What's missing in the yellow book is the mugness. The mugness is one of the. It's got lots of bookness. But it wasn't the book that gave him the. Exactly. So. Exactly. I reckon. I reckon Mystic Meg won me seven and a half million. Right. Sure. Yeah, sure. Yeah. So, I mean, I don't know, Carl, do you think that that's pretty spooky and weird, unnatural stuff. So I'm just a bit livid today. I wasn't really listening to what you were saying. Not paying attention. Yeah. So, okay. Do you want to notify us before. Yeah. You are giving to us. Go on. It would have just been nice if you would have, like, warm me. You were going to ask me about it. I'm just. Just a bit livid. Go on. What about? Just. Have I done something about. No, no, not you two. Just. Just bit livid. XFM 104.9. Stan. Clear. Adam F. Mop. We all know whose dad Adam F is. Who was. No, we all know who's Adam F's dad of we all of no dads, do we, Rick? Can you keep it? Keep filling? Because I've realized I've left my mobile phone on and the kind of calls I'm going to be getting on a Saturday afternoon. Yeah, I'll just keep. Oh, that was Adam F and Mop. Stand clear. We all know Adam F's got a dad. Oh, done it again. Do you remember the trivia quiz? I forgot it. Whose dad is Adam F? Elvin Stardust. Yes. Shane Fenton. That's what the F must be for. You're back. That's done. Yeah. Yeah, we wouldn't want to be. Oh, oh. All the people. They're calling you all the time anyway. Xfm 104.9. We're gonna start now. We're gonna start now. This is proper radio from now. Go, go. Oh, there's a lot of pressure on me now. Yeah, I'm gonna muck it up now. Rick, I know you're a big trivia fan. I know you're obsessed with trivia and I thought to myself, well, how can I entertain Rick on Saturday? Go on. So I was wandering around on the web looking for trivia basically that could entertain you. And you're a big animal trivia. I love animal facts. There's not much that you don't know about animals. But here's. You're patched me out now, aren't you? No. Well, I don't know. Here's one. I don't know if you heard this one before. Ants never sleep. No, I know. Yeah. Oh, I know. And, and they've got alcohol in their blood so they don't freeze and win without. And that's why you never see a lazy an. It's always working. It's drunk. But it's always. They never sleep. But they do take a lot of breaks. Yeah, I know. Yeah, I think it's. They can't sleep cuz it's like noisy neighbors. There's about a million of them living sometimes in a room and they just. It must be very. But you see them, you see them carrying a leaf and they see someone else and they go, do you want a hand with that? And they go, don't be silly, you're carrying some at eight times your body weight as it is. He goes, well, you know, I've got another pair of hands free. Yeah, give you a hand. Yeah, they're great. They're incredible. They're incredible. Yeah, I knew that one. Next. Okay, what this is, this is one I'm throwing right at you as well, Kyle. There's only one bird that has a penis. It's not a joke. No, it's not a joke. It's not a joke. This is a genuine trivia question, I'd say. Oh, I say, I think I've seen one on this. Is it an ostrich? Right, you're going for ostrich, Colonel. I'll go for ostrich as well. Right. Did you come up with that yourself or. Yeah, I was gonna say that before you said it. Well guys, you went for ostrich chicken. You're both wrong. It's actually the swan. I lost it. The chicken, yeah. That's a bit worrying then, because I thought I saw an ostrich penis. So what was I looking at? I don't know. Were you just examining it closely at the zoo? No, I just. I was just. It's probably a strap on. It was probably two laser ostriches giving each other one. Exactly. And I just. And that, that's. That's how that can influence people. Things like that. Dirty filthy leather ostriches can confuse a. Child if he's in the zoo and he doesn't know a swan's got. That's really annoying. I'd never give a swan a knob. It's the little puffiest of all birds. Oh, I'm protected by the queen. But I need a knob. I'd give. If I had to give a knob to any bird. Good question. No, I wish I'd posed that myself. If you could give a. Not a knob to any bird, what would it be? Phone IN Vulture. Of course, a vulture. They need a big thing. Yeah. What about yourself, Carl? If you could give a knob to any bird and don't make it rude. Or if I could give a knob to any bird. It's got to be a bird of prey or something like that. Isn't it cool? Just a robin, really. That would be amazing. Yeah, that would be. Christmas cards would be like. Yeah, but it's a normal human sized knob. That'd be great, wouldn't it? And the other thing annoying about this, this is. This is ironic, right? Now, all the male of all bird species are usually. They're called a. Yes, right. But the only bird with a. Yeah, right. Is called a cob. Is that what a swan's called? Yeah, they're cob and pen. They're not cock and hen. And he's got. They've. He isn't a. But he's got a. Yeah, yeah. Quick query there, Rick, go on. When you said then. Yeah. Presumably you meant male bird. Yeah. The first time you said it. Yeah. The second time you said it, you said. Do you mean the penis? Well, you're showing off the whole farce of radio broadcast because you're not really allowed to say. No. Exactly. No one would cause great offense. Yeah, the other's fine. Exactly. It's weird. It's strange. It's strange. So I mean, if we said. If I said now to you, you know. Oh, I like. Yeah. Meaning birds. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. But if I meant penises, it would be a problem. If you like Cox and it was pre. Yeah, yeah, that would be. Carl, do you like cocks? Do you like cogs? No, right, okay, that's fine, that's fine. I was asking if you like. I like. You know. Yeah. I'm a big fan of tits. The small birds that come down and peck at you. Yeah, yeah, you like tits. And there's nothing. There's anyone. There's nothing. Carl, don't worry, there's nothing wrong. No, when I said tits, I meant the little birds. Yeah. I mean the little. The big birds. Yeah. Do you know when. Go on. No. Go on. No, it's just that it's when you talk like tits. Yeah. You know, at the milk. Do you. They, they. I like the fact they flutter away when they hear the milkman coming. Oh, come on. So when. What? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? No, when the milkman's coming. When he's walking up. Ash and sometimes. Lovely song. Gotta apologize to our producer there because he's worried about it. There was nothing wrong with it. It's just like saying, you what? You know, you like watching birds in the garden. I think you're better than that. I know, it's cheap, isn't it, to say like, I like tits. Yeah. I like. So, a little bit more literary now. One of my favorite things is fanny by gaslight. Really? That's interesting. That's interesting. I'm a big fan of Moby Dick. Oh, the. Oh, yeah. The book, maybe. Yeah. Not the medical condition. There's nothing anyway. No, no, it's the big horrible thing that used to swallow semen. Now I. In the winter. Yeah. Steve gone. There's nothing I like more than to keep my hands warm in a muff. No, sure, sure, sure. You mean those kind of furry things, that sort of classy looking ladies. Yeah. Posh ladies often put their hands. Yeah. You know when you have a nice. Like a party and they're leaving. Yeah. Winter party and you might take the wrong hat or something. There's nothing I like more than to see two posh women with their hands in each other's muffs. Oh, that's always a problem. And they're going, oh, this must be yours. Yeah, that is always funny. Yeah, that's always funny. Yeah. But seriously. No, no, don't stop this. You're right, I've got a degree. I think I just. I just remembered that my favorite Beatles song is Come Together. Yeah, now we're gonna stop this now, Carl, because it's childish. You're right. I've got a philosophy degree, for Christ's sake. And it's. It's about time. Who's your favorite philosopher? Do you mind me asking? Well, I would tell you, except when I ever talk about it, I go into a cockney accent. Really? So it can be like my favorite philosopher. I like a bit of cant. Right. Is that Emmanuel the philosopher? Yeah. That's strange. Yeah, that's strange. What's his name again? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That can be weird. Can be strange. Look at Carl's face. Look at his face. Join in, Carl. Undo your trousers. We'd be like Stan Boardman when he told the joke. Yeah. We won't do local radio again for 10 years. Ian Brown. Dolphins were monkeys. Yep. For that. I don't know what that was. I'm still pissed off that swans have got. Yeah. It's a waste. It's a waste of a knob with a swan. What they're doing with it half the time now. We've got some great. Do you remember we stopped with a city innuendos now. But do you remember? I think it's because they've got a long neck and to balance them properly in the water. What are those things that boats have underneath? A roger? No, no. Yeah. The keels. Yeah. The big maybe. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? It might be. You might be right. Yeah. Balance. What about. But ducks would need one as well, wouldn't they? Ducks. They got short necks. I see what you mean. It's the necks. Yeah. So. Hold on. So do you think that's. So. Long necks, long knob. Don't look at me. That's Steve. I know. No, Sandy Toshfake's got a tiny, hasn't she? But she has got one, which is interesting. That's libelous. I just like to say now that Sandy Toshwag has never had a knob. No, she's not. But you're not lying about the neck. She's got a little neck. That's fine. That's. That's. That's clear for all to see. I just remember I saw one Opportunity Knocks once. Opportunity Knocks, Yeah. It was a pianist who wrote It's True and his name was Wayne King. Do you like Wayne King, Kyle? What's your opinion on Wayne King? I don't know his work. You're not. You're not a fan of his work? Okay. No, no, that's fine. We asked your opinion, mate, and you've given it and that's all we can ask for. Oh, no Opinion on Wayne King. If you. If you're a fan of Wayne King at home, please get in touch. The email address I had Ricky Gervais@xfm.co.uk what was the number again? 087-008-001234. You know, if you like winking or if you know. No, we're asking someone's music opinion. It's a music station. What, all day? You and your girlfriends again? I think people enjoy that more. You are grumpy. Why are you grumpy? You're all grumpy because you've been load. Come on, tell us. Come on. I think I've got sad. What's that mean? That thing when it's. When it's dark outside and you feel depressed. Oh, yeah, I think I've got that. But you're from Manchester, aren't you? Isn't it like pitch black there all the time? Isn't it like, which countries? Is it Iceland or. It's like. It's like dark all year. The land of the mole people. I was telling Steve before, in fact. I'm not gonna bore you with it. Go on. What were you saying about Wayne? Well, you bored me with it earlier. Can't you bore him with it? Yeah, it's only fair. What were you saying? About what? Wayne King. Oh, Carl, play a recording. You're a pervert. Thanks, Liquido. Play some rock. That's what we're doing, Steve. We are indeed. For that Weezer island in the sun. Can I just ask Carl a quick question? Yeah. Why does he swear so much on radio? No, no, no, no. Carl, did you see that film last night? Gaylord say no. Yes. What were you watching that for? Yeah. Weirdo. Oh, you're always gonna lose with that one, Rick. Did you see that film last night? Gaylord say no. No. Oh, no. You're a Gaylord. Oh. That is actually the official way of finding out if someone's gay. That's how Oscar Wilde got caught. That's exactly how he got caught. Yeah. They went. Well, we got no evidence. The arm was okay. Anyway, cheers, my lad. Oh, before you go, Oscar, see that film last night? Go and say no, no, no. Take him away. Yeah, Take him to that bender downstairs. Take him out of my sight is. How they got him. Yeah, that's the official way. Yeah. Children in need last night, Rick. I watched a bit of it. Did you watch any of it, Carl? It's awful. It is pretty bad. It's the worst thing ever. I mean, it just. I've said this before. The thing about criminal needy. It makes the whole country and BBC one for one day into just one big school. Fate. Yeah. I mean, it's so pathetic. The entertainment is ill thought out. It's just. It's just boring. I prefer it if they just made everyone pay a pound. That'd be fine. Yeah. And they make more money and we won't have to sit through it, just. Add it to the license. But surely that's exactly. Surely that's just a. Taxation that we should. You know, as opposed to going through this nonsense of seeing people from West End musicals who aren't selling come out and do a song. Yeah, of course. God. But it's just that they may as well, because I know there was Terry Wogan at one point going around the audience with a bucket, just running it, getting all members of the audience to put loose change in a bucket. This is national television. Yeah. They've already had to sit through three hours of rubbish. Now you're making them pay for it. Does he get paid? I. I don't know if he's done it for. I know. You know, it's a lot of people who go on there, though. All the pop acts that go on there, they're all plugging a new single, of course. But that's. It's like. Well, this is this mask of sor. Charade of charity. But they're all plugging a single. Yeah. It's just pathetic. It's utterly. They may as well bring on a Big Tom Polar, you know. And guess how many kind of pennies are in the jar. How did Pudsy lose his eye as well? Well, you get another one out if you're not careful. And I was watching. I watched it quite late because we just had it on in the corner. We were sort of chatting and stuff and about 1 o'clock in the morning. Okay. They've been promising this for ages. It was a couple of sort of Hollyoak stars or something. Male. Male stars were going to be part of a male stripper striptease. Yeah. Full Monty type. I. I turned that off. Yeah. I didn't want to watch that, Steve. You know, it's the way I said. It's been promising for ages. It was like one in the morning almost staying on. Yes. That's a bit weird. Yeah, yeah. Did you see that film last night, Gaylord tape? No, but the point was like the thing about the. Are you a gaylord tied to a tree? Yeah. Yeah. There you are then. There you are. But no, seriously. So they bring on these, this, this male stripper kind of g on like, you know, firemen or whatever. And they come on and they're like, cut to the audience. And there was one woman just putting her glasses on, like about a four year old woman. It was like. It was one in the morning. She'd Fallen asleep. And her friend. Agnes. Agnes, quick, put your glasses on. Wake up. They're getting their mean. Yeah. And they, they, they did this strip tees, right? They did the strip tees. And I have to swear, right? They went right down to their. Their under. They had these kind of. And they were just flashing their asses. They just. It was. And I was thinking, this is for kiddies. And it was obscene. It was utterly obscene. I was going in the morning. It's not what you're talking about. It was appalling. It's just the charity is. No, but it was just. It was, it was offensive. I was offended by it. It was the BBC, it was charity. And there were blokes with their todgers almost out. Yeah, but the fact is. Yeah, but it's post watershed. You can have any event and give it to anything. That's not right. It's for children. Because a lot of children will stay up and watch that. Their parents will go, yeah, it's fine. You know, you can stay and watch Children in Need. That's for kids. Yeah, but then asses aren't, you know, it was. But it wasn't just asses. They gave the impression they were fully nude. I mean, thankfully they weren't. I made a close inspection, but it was okay. Yeah, we're looking at each other. Yeah, you're looking at each other. Engaging into each other's eyes. Yeah. Just for one week only. We're back at school. Okay. There's innuendos. We laugh when we say the word bender. Tits meaning birds. Carl and Ricky sitting in a tree. K I S S I N G Rick, have you been enjoying Bubba Sparks'current hit, Ugly? You're ugly. Oh, I'm ugly. Ugly. A song which means nothing to me, actually. I can't relate to it at all. What you make of Bubba? I like Bubba. He's a sort of down south kind of rapper. I know where this is going. I bet you've got a little bit of Bubba in your Hip Hop Challenge. Well, we did have the Hip Hop Challenge a couple of weeks ago, but I lost. So basically we're just playing a favorite hip hop track hours, aren't we? Each week. And this is my selection. It's from Bubba's current album. It's not the hit Ugly, it's. The album's actually called Dark Days, Bright Nights. And I believe this song presumably comes from that title because it's called Dark Days, Bright Nights. Enjoy it, Rick. I will. Bubba Sparks, Dark Days, Bright Nights, title track of his current album, Rick what do you make? I love it. It's great. It's hypnotic. It's. Ah. The chorus is. That sounds like Stevie. Wonderful. It does sound like Steve. I don't know. I haven't got the inlay sleeve to hand. I can't tell you. Does anyone know? Maybe they could call in Rick. I'd love to give out the number. In fact, I will. Oh. 8 700-800-1234 ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk who is providing the chorus for Bubba Sparks's Dark days, bright nights, 104.9 XFM. Wow. From Rubber Sparks to Sparky Bubs. Those sparky bug boys. Suede. Hey. Slick Strokes last night on XFM. 104.9. Before that, suede. Absolutely beautiful ones. Fella just phoned up and said you were talking about waterfowl before. Yeah. The only bird with a penis is the swan. He said it was worried him about the. The ugly duckling. They'll go about. Oh, he turned into a swan. But ducklings, they're not called ducklings. They're called signets. I pointed out that the, the. The. The swan in question didn't understand because he thought he was a duckling. Yeah. And that. That all the other ducks sort of laughed at him because he was all gangly and everything. But they turned into one. They realized I was a swan all along. Yeah. The ugly duckling story got me through so many bleak nights as a child. You couldn't wait to one day turn into a swan. Still waiting for it. So you can have a knob. Yeah, yeah, because. So look, don't worry. It's a nice little. No one's gonna complain about this. This is lovely, childish, lovely little innuendo. There's nothing nasty or vicious. There's no. Anyway, off air, you're a different California. You were trying to get us with the Gaylord's joke. Yes, he was. And he tried to do this. This is. We'd done the Gaylord. Did you see that film? That's not Gaylord. So now Carl trying to get his own back. When did you watch Gaylords? Last night. Brilliant. It's gotta be. Did you see that film last night? Gaylords say no, and then you say no, and we all point and laugh. Oh, I was gonna ask you. Is it. Is it true he's leaving Friday? Robinson Crusoe. Nice one. High five for it. Oh, he got you right. He got you the right one there. I don't know what that means, but he did. Anyway, we're talking about children In Need. Oh, yeah. And he's just got it. He's just got it. Yeah. Children in need earlier. And as I said, I'm not a fan of it. And this is a couple years ago I was working and we had to drive up to. To Blackpool. Oh, yeah. And so it was Comic Relief night, was a Friday night. We were listening to all the different kind of BBC radio stations because they all cover Comic Relief. They also link up as one big. And I think this is maybe like, sort of, I don't know, BBC Solly Hull or something. And they've always got, like, they've got this, this one guy in the studio doing all the DJing and there's some bloke who's sort of outside the BBC with some kids and what kind of doing a live link up. And the guy outside was Steve Baxter. I forget the name of the DJ inside. I love the fact you remember this man's name. Well, it's important because we're listening and the guy in the studio, he's there and he's chatting away and he's going, got a signed picture, signed picture here of the Spice Girls that all the girls have signed that. So the highest bidder gets to win that. And you have that. And I seem to have run out of words. He just said, I seem to have run out of words. And we're like listening, like, okay. And he just went, I seem to run out of words. I wonder if Steve Baxter's got any for me. And Steve Baxter was just outside, like, obviously not ready, just going. Didn't have any words either. Well, who's got all the words? It was wordless. I don't believe it. He's probably used up too many words in the first hour. Exactly. He just used all the words up. And he didn't want to repeat himself. Exactly. So he just thought, that's it. It was a hideous London. So we were enjoying that and the work of Steve Baxter. And we were driving along and then we were driving and we got stuck in this just jam on the way up to Blackpool and I saw this kind of white Mercedes, like, couple of thought it looks quite swank, you know, and I'm swank. And I drove up, we were driving up behind it and the number plate was something. I can't remember exactly. I think it was something like. Or of one. I'm thinking interesting. Or of one, you know. So we're driving alongside. Who is driving? No, actually wasn't the driver. It was. There was a guy driving it in the front seat. Asleep. Green Dog. Keith Harris. Really? Keith Harris was there. Orville, as I recall, on the back seat. Oh no. I couldn't believe it. Yeah. Was asleep or I think he was asleep. Just knackered. I didn't, I didn't see Cuddles, the crazy monkey, I suspect. I imagine he would have popped up at some point. Just annoying the driver's hair. Yeah. You've got. I think Cuddles has to go in. The boot because it caused havoc. Yeah. Knowing Cuddles, he'd put his hands over the driver's eyes. But the thing is he doesn't understand road safety to be. To be fair, at least a monkey. Yeah, yeah. He's got a lisp and not even, not even a real one at that thing. What was about Orville is that argument raged for years between him and Harris and Orville's right. He can't fly. He can't fly. So I'm worried that Harris will love him. Just full sense security. But you can fly. Yeah. And then when Harris is out, Orville are climb onto a chair, onto a windowsill, basically think he can fly and just plummet to his death. Just a quick point about Orville. I'm surprised he's still not potty trained because he's been. He's been wearing that nappy of his for years. I know he's talk. He's mastered the power. Yeah, yeah. Still crapping everywhere, I assume. I assume so. Running around. Yeah. And as we definitely know as a duck. So he hasn't got a cock. He has not got a penis. Penis. Sorry, that was a mistake there. I did say. Did you mean penis though? Yeah. You shouldn't have said that, Rick. I'm really sorry. You should have pretended you meant bird. Oh, I'm really sorry. We're going to put your. Put your fingers in your mouth like this, Carl. Right. Put it apart like that. Now just say bucket and spade. No, with your finger, put your fingers out and just say bucket and spade. Bucket and spade. No, don't keep your fingers in your mouth when you say it. It. Oh, Carl, Carl. Smashing pumpkins on top of an XFM 104.9. I just got to tell you something, Steve. Remember at my birthday party my girlfriend had bought me one of those arcade games? She put money in a pub. Oh, it's a quiz machine. Quiz machine. Yeah. And we're all playing but Steve with his general film knowledge people were getting like a hundred thousand points and getting through. Right. Steve got something like 8 million. Right, listen, I got the top score On a movie trivia quiz game. Right, who's the geek now? Yeah, all right, Carl. Hello. No, but it was impossible. I tried it and I. For, like, months, I thought. I just thought, I've just gotta knock him off the top. And I did it with all the other categories and I was best at Rock. I was best at rock. Let's. Let's say that. But by no means is, you know, the gap between a friend of mine and a friend of yours. Johnny Camden, the lovely Irish comedian, came around last night, had a couple of goes. He got something like 30 million. That's mental. It was. That's madness. Yeah. In fact, he's. You're right, because Johnny bought this comic, right? He loves Doctor who and he bought this comic and Steve, he left it there and Steve got a post. Now, on every page wrote geek. Johnny gets it home, reads this, reads on the Tube, and there's geek written everywhere on every page. That's the sort of vicious man Steve is. He can hand it out. Do you know what I mean? Imagine him calling you a geek. What could that. What must that feel like to be called a geek by Steve Merchant? What do you think, Kyle? Every week he has a go at me, anyway. What are you talking about? You. You're having a go at me every week, Three weeks. What? You've been having a go at me. I have not had a go. You've always had a go at me. You've always said to me, what do I look like? And what do you expect me to do? Lie? Oh, he's done you again, Steve. No, I'm not getting into this. He's done you again. Lad called up before and said, oh, have a go at Steve again. These looks, and it's not like a game. I'm not, like, coming in here every week and wanting to make you look, you know, come across as an ugly bloke. I don't need to do that. He's done you. I can't. He's done you. Just because of the Gaylord stuff. No, you're having a go at me again. Oh, it's just that you. You had to go at me before. I didn't have a go at you at all. I was talking to Ricky. I've spoken a word to you. Is this why you're in an ugly mood? A bad mood, a generally grim mood? Is it because, like, you, you just think, I'm gonna have a go at you? I don't know what it is. When I get here, you're all right. And as soon as you come in here, you change. I haven't done anything. What are you talking about? You're paranoid. I haven't said anything, mate. I've drawn a little picture of you here. But I'll tell you what, what we need now is a song for the lovers. I want to tell you now, this has been one of my favorite songs for about 20 years. It's by David Bowie. Now, David Bowie's had his phases and I liked his glam stuff and I. You know, Tim Machine went off. You know, he's always sort of there on and off, right? But this song is off space on it and it's called Letter to Hermione. And I don't know why he stopped writing songs like this because this is probably one of the most beautiful songs ever recorded. And I know Steve agrees me on this. I do indeed. Rick, can I just kiss and make up with Carl? No, that is. No, let me just. Let me. Just kidding. My kiss. But it doesn't. Next, then next week it'll be the same again. It doesn't mean anything. It's like saying, sorry. Oh, I've never. Carl has gone a absolute shade of purple. Straining not to have merchants. There's no point. Point, Steve. No, there's no point. No. Just shake. Just shake and make up. Shake. What? Really? There you go. All friends sit down. This. That's lovely. That's a Lovely moment. It's XFM 104.9. And this is Letter to Hermione by David Bowie. It's beautiful. By David Bowie. Well, after that, I think you wrote the Laughing Gnome. I know. It's just the thing about David Bowie, I feel the same way. It's that he's clearly a great, you know, rock musician. Great, you know, great fun records. You know, I saw McLastonberry. Absolutely fantastic entertainer. But his songs have never gripped me. They never got me at the heart, you know. Except that one. Except that one. That's the first one I've ever heard of his. Which really got in the gut. Amazing lyrics. Yeah, brilliant. Yeah. Carl, what are your thoughts? Sorry, yeah, you're a poet, Carl. Play something else then. Blur. Coffee and tv. Good to hear that one again. Yes. Good for that. Radiohead. True love waits. Well, Steve, it's time for my world famous film review. People love it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How can I just ask before you crack on with the film review, I noticed you often do films that people have already seen. Well, you see, that's what it means. That's why I think your film review failed, because People didn't know what film you're talking about. They hadn't seen it. Yes, see, there was mine. I picked ones they've seen that, you know, a lot of people would say. That the benefit of a film review was the fact that they hadn't seen it yet. So they were going to make up their mind based on that. I don't know who'd say that. I prefer Ricky's. Okay, see. All right, Carl. See, there you are again being nasty to me. No, it's just. He's got a choice. All right, Anyway, so my point is that how would you hope people would use your reviews? Whatever that. However they want, really. Okay, so would you hope that they'd maybe seen the film, but they hadn't yet made up their mind whether they liked it or whether they liked it? Well, this is again up to them. This is, you know, this is for everyone. It's easy. So if someone say it's because I think was it you did. One of your most famous ones, I think was one for the cuckoo's nest. Yeah. Now that came out, I think, in 1975. So maybe some people saw it in 1975, haven't yet made up their mind as to what they thought. Yeah. Now this is. This put them straight and what to look for next time maybe. Okay, now ready, Rookie? Gervais, film review. Review. Right. Chosen. Rain Man. Rain Man. Okay, now this has been on TV quite a few times and it was a multiple Oscar winner. Exactly. Okay, so, okay, right, Rayman. It's got Tom Cruise in it and he's all right, he's normal. But he finds out he's got a brother who's a bit mad. Dustin Hoffman is doing it right? And it's meant to be. He's all weird, but he's meant to be. So it's good acting. Now he. Oh, God. He needs to keep his brother, but they don't want him to have a brother and he doesn't remember a lot, but he dropped him in the bath and burnt him. He was little. Clumsy idiot. But then he finds out he can make a bit of money. So they get the same suits and they go bet two for good. Well, because he's got special powers so he can know what the word. The roulette. He wins that and he drops some toothpicks. He knows how many there are. And he recognizes the waitress. He's just throw through the book. He's got all his football cards. Don't put my order. Don't go in the telephone box with him. He smells and get him back in time for Jeopardy. Or watch it anyway. Then they slap his head and get worried. Qantas don't crash. So he's got all that and in the end he doesn't, I don't think. But at least they've met each other. Yeah, yeah, of course. Ray Man. A film about autism, which is strangely appropriate, I think, when you're reviewing it. Anyway. What would you give it out of ten? Oh, nine. Okay. Thanks very much for that. Were useful. Yeah. Have you seen the film before? No, I will now. Okay. Jolly good. Well, excellent. New order. 60 miles an hour on XFM, 104.9. Well, about quarter of an hour to go. Yep. We've still got your Song for the Ladies. Song for Ladies coming up. Time now, though, Rick. Four under the Covers. You've Got Me covered. Cover Me Bad, which is when we play a cover version. Yeah. A well known hit. Just see the sort of effort that goes into the show. It's a lot of work. We've learned something. We've learned the only bird with a penis is the swan. We've had an interesting anecdote where he saw Orville. I saw Orville. Yeah. Keith Harris. We've had a film review. Rain Man. Informative, Award winning. An award winning film I reviewed today. Yes. So that was an Oscar winner. There's been things. Ants never sleep. Yeah. If you missed the beginning, you won't know that fact. We've had various songs, music and that. Beautiful. So carry on, Steve. Cover me up. The White Stripes. Everyone's raving about them. Rich. Sure, they are an exciting band. And this is their cover of the Dolly Parton classic. Jolene. Love it already. White Stripes and their version of Jolene. What did you make of it? Really loved it. Loved it. I want to ask Carl a question, though, because Carl, sometimes in awe of this new fangled world we live in. What. What do you think of the scenario? What do you think is going on there? Because it's a bloke singing to a woman, begging her not to take his man. What do you think's going on there? Say again? Well, that's a bloke there singing. Yeah. To his. To his. To his wife, Jolene. Were you listening? Anyway, I thought it was about that. That one about the person who chucks himself off a bridge. So I was thinking more about that than listening to that one. Right, listen, right. Jolene, Jolene, I'm begging of you, please don't take my man. You're Flamingox of auburn hair. He's Gonna. Even though you can. Don't. He's all I've got. You're a beautiful woman. Don't take my man because I can't compete with you. Right? Yeah. What do you think's going on there, though? Because, you know, it's Dolly Parton singing it. We know what's going on. They're fighting over the same man, aren't we? Yeah. What do you think's going on when a bloke's singing it to Jolene? What do you think of the scenario there? That's one of them names, isn't it? That could be a bloke's name. It's like Leslie. Oh, Christ. Okay. Sorry. It was a. I don't. I wish you'd not asked him that question. So exhausting. I love him. Do ants sleep? Carl. Which. Which bird's got a cock? Swan. Swan. Okay, Nice one. Listen, I want to play that song for various people who've emailed and phoned in saying they want requests. We don't really play requests on the show. We'd like to mention them. Any Matt Bar, Magic Thighs. That's not Matt Bars. Magic Thighs. That's Matt Bar and Magic Thighs. Kieran in Dublin, Stuart and Hackney. Lisa and Allison in Crouch End. And Glenn in Crystal palace, who was phoning up with a nice message earlier. All of you, thanks for listening and thanks for enjoying it. Sorry I didn't play your requests, but tune in next time. It'll be fun. Anyway, I just thought. I wanted to say. Really. Here's tragic. What's tragic? What did you want me to say about that song? Just your opinion. Your own opinion was fine. In fact. In fact, your own opinion is better than anything I could really hope for. Without doubt. Whenever I ask you a question, you constantly surprise us. Yeah, you're. It's. It's wonderful. So only ever carry on telling the truth. Carry on saying exactly what's on your mind. And I think this could become a great. You're like a man who was frozen in Victorian era and has been re. Awoken. And he's kind of discovering the world. Some things make sense, other things. Yeah, it's beautiful. As opposed to one that was made in a castle in Victorian times, like Steve. Oh, that's just. Oh, I've joined in. Macaron. I can't believe it. I'm sorry. Yeah. No, it was irresistible, though, wasn't it? I'm really sorry. Should we play a record? Right. I'm afraid that is about it from us. Absolutely. I always leave the ladies with the song, Rick, as you know. And the song for the ladies this week again. It comes from the free giveaway CD that comes with this excellent little magazine called Comes with a Smile. And there's always something interesting. I've played the Mull Historical Science before. This is a track. It says it's just a demo, which is. I don't know why. If they've been picked up. It's outrageous. They're called Sloan and this is called Pretty Together. See you next time. Goodbye.",

He wins that and he drops some toothpicks. He knows how many there are. And he recognizes the waitress. He's just throw through the book. He's got all his football cards. Don't put my order. Don't go in the telephone box with him. He smells and get him back in time for Jeopardy. Or watch it anyway. Then they slap his head and get worried. Qantas don't crash.
