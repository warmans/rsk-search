  "text": "Hi, sir. I'm XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. Steve Merchant. He's with you. Oh, yeah, yeah. Sentences. Just using the English. When you put me off, you pointed to yourself and I just said, steve Merchant. You know what? We know. We do that every week. You introduce me, you say with me and I go, steve Merchant. No. Yeah. It's a catchphrase that everyone's waiting to. Hear it, but usually I go, ricky Gervais and you go with Steve Merchant. But this time he pointed to you. So I said it, but I didn't say I. It caught me off guard, so I didn't use the sentence. Oh, I don't like the way you sit. Right. I've read medically that if you're slouching like that, can you try and describe how you're sighting. But you've got the kind of mic. Have you ever seen that picture of when John Lennon was off his head on smack recording Let It Be, and he was lying on the floor at Abbey Road? That's basically what Ricky Spains. I was scared. It's not good for you, that. Look at the. You've not. You can't breathe, probably in the diaphragm. So you're going to get. Speak. But badly. Listen, I was trying to speak medical stuff there. I was trying to run into trouble. Yeah. Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick. What are the words to wow. Rap. What are the words? I don't remember. W. What the hell's going to you? Hey, sucker. No, there's nothing you can do. Brilliant. You look forward to a forthcoming revival of your music career. Yeah. Rick, I had some devastating news last night. Go on. You know when I left you, I was off to buy a PlayStation 2. Yeah. I just. I was totally in the mood for a while. Or a PS2, as he said. Yeah, yeah. Which. Which confused him. Granddad. So, you know, I think I went in like, some electrical stop on Oxford Street. Yeah. And I'll just say the thing about Steve is I wouldn't say he's mean. He hates that. He's careful, right? And he will. He will spend days to get a pound off, Rick. Two and a half hours. I walked around last night, I swear to God, walking to different shops, right? I went from Oxford street to Piccadilly Circus, back again along the length of Oxford street, back again all over the place, right? I realized I basically couldn't get a better deal than about 240quid, right, for a console and a game. So I ended up in Virginia Megastore. I bought a Auto Grand Theft 3 or whatever and a PlayStation and a memory card or whatever. So I shoot off and I'm walking off and I'm going to the tube and I walk all the way to HMV and on Opposite Bond street and I just popped in there because I'd forgotten to get something and I went downstairs and I was walking past the PlayStations and it went, if you buy a PlayStation 2, you can get Grand Theft Auto 3 with £20 off. I was absolutely devastated. What did you do? I just. I crumbled. I didn't know what to do. I was thinking of taking it back to Virgin Megastar going, it's faulty. But before, you haven't got home yet. Oh, I can tell. No, I didn't mean to buy this though. What do you mean to buy? Keyboard. Exactly. So the problem is when I get it back and I wire it up and that, all I can see is the cars are racing around the track. All I'm thinking, thinking is it's like one of those cartoons when a really hungry bloke could just see his mate as like a big chicken. All I could see on the TV was just a 20 pound note just floating. It was an absolute night. I'm just devastated by 20 quid. I could have bought like another cheap game for that. Did I tell you this? Would you give me £20 and then I'll shut up about it? Yeah, yeah. We went to the casino once, a group of us, and I lost about 100 quid and it was, it was a, you know, great. It was someone's birthday, it was Jane's birthday And Steve, after three hours of gambling, had lost the £20 he got out to play with. Right. I was going, you're really gutted, aren't you? Just went, have you any idea how much cheese I could get for £20? Yeah. Cold meats. Yeah, for £20. And there it is again last night, £20. I'm robbed of £20. Literally. They've taken it from my hand, the HMV people, they've taken that and they've. I'm going to try and think of some things to cheer you up. Should we play some songs? Avalanche is there. Frontier Psycho. I never enjoy any record where I think I or a 4 year old could have made it. Do you know what I mean? It's like, it's cheating. It's musical cheating. Yeah, I'm not a big fan of that one. I won't play that again then. All right. Okay, that's done. Yeah. All right. Nice. Shake on it. Yeah. XFM 104.0 kiss on it. It's on it. Touch on it this morning. And he said he was soaking wet because obviously it's miserable out. And actually, if you're thinking of leaving the house today and thus missing the show, do not leave because it's miserable out. It's like a weather report as well. We play music, we got chat, we little jokes, don't we? But Carl came and it's raining. He said he was soaking wet. I said to him, I said, rick would want you to do it. I want you to do it. Yeah. Take your clothes off. Pop him over there. But you know what? And he wouldn't. And he said, I was going to do it, but I knew you'd say that. But when you left us in the kitchen when he was making coffee, he went, yeah. Steve said, if you wet, take your trousers off. And I thought, hold on, Ricky's not here. What's he up to? There were thoughts. No, I was talking on behalf of Rick. I phoned him up, I said, he's wet. What should I suggest? Well, I said. Well, I was in his ear, he had an earpiece, and I was going, tell him it's bad for him. Yeah. And I can even go, it's bad for you. You go when I want to go. Tell him it's. It could rheumatism. Yeah. It could lead to rheumatism. Drop. Take him off. Carl, speak. No one's heard your voice today. Come on, Carl. He doesn't want it. No, I know he doesn't. We're not. We won't talk to you much, but. Gone. It's just nice to say hello to you. Yeah. People think people quite like you. Yeah. We've had some fan mail. I like his little face, his little Moby. I drew a picture of him in the week, just doodling. And he got really insulting. Did he? Why did you get insulted? Because it wasn't very good. I looked like Ian Canfield on. It wasn't insult. Yeah. Ladies love Canfield. Yeah. I mean, they're weird kind of heavy metal ladies. Yeah. The ones that drink blood. Yeah. Yeah. They love Canfield. I thought of you look like so. But I think you might find it insulting as well. It's just meant to be affectionate for people who don't know what you look like. You look like Beaker at the Muppets. I can't see how that would be. Ah. Oh, God. We don't know. You put it like that. It is Sort of like, I like Mika. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you like him because he's a fool. He just goes, what does he say to me? Yeah, yeah. Well, you look a bit like that doctor that used to accompany him everywhere, that professor. Oh, yeah. A little fat. Yeah. That's nice. Carl, what was it that you told me as well, when you came in? Just. Just Carl's thought for the day. Okay, Carl, what did you tell me when you came in? Because it was miserable out and you made a. It is a grim day in London. I like it already. Brilliant. I was thinking, could you imagine dying today? Go on, explain more, though. Just because when you're dying, you're always like in your bedroom, in your bed, always. And your family's next door. Always. Yeah. And I just thought, can you imagine lying there looking out your window? Because they do that as well. They sort of have the curtains open to get a bit of light on your face. And I just thought, what a day. If this was like your last day, could you imagine? But they. Go on. You made another more, more even more profound point. You said if instead of dying on a rainy day, you'd prefer to. No, if you died on a bit of a nicer sunny day, then it's not so bad. No, it's your last day looking out on the world and look at it. Don't you agree? Yeah. I thought that was a beautiful point. It was poetic almost. It was, wasn't it? Because. No, the point was that what upset me was that you said you'd been thinking about that today on the way in, and it upset you. But my point was that if you think about the people that are dying any day, it'll upset you. Yeah. Do you see? Yeah. But you don't think about it when. When it's sunny because you think, well, it'll be all right today. They won't be that annoyed. You're absolutely annoyed. Annoyed. No, I'm dying today. It was just when I got up and opened the curtains and I thought, look at it. Yeah. I'm not dying today. Yeah. Carl, play a song. Yeah. Interesting society watching Xanadu on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant. See, it doesn't work if you say with me, Steve Merchant. I've got to say either. I've either got to say with me or you just go with Steve Merchant. Sure, sure, sure. See what I mean? Okay. It's not as easy as it. No, it's not. No. It's not as easy as it seems, you know this. Right. I mean, what radio show we do? Right. Well, we just come in and we don't plan them. We just sort of like chat and they still pay us. It seems good. Am I. Should we just do this all day. Or all day on XFM or just get a. Get a license where it is just. It's Ricky and Steve fm. And we just chat and we go, what are you doing there, Steve? Just having breakfast. You go, all right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, what are you. I'll just clean the windows. Nut. And we have a little chat. We go, I'm just reading the paper. And we just talk and we play. Records for 24 hours a day. Yeah. I mean, have you spotted any flaws in that plan or. It would be boring after about an hour and a half. Yeah. Is that it? Yeah. Okay. I mean, this is boring now. No, we've only done 20 minutes. We were talking about a car, having a thought, remember? Yes. And then I had that thought when I went. I went out to get some orange juice and I had that thought. So maybe this show could be about. Let's have thoughts. Okay, so we have thoughts. Yeah. Okay. Or they could. If we haven't got any, they could phone in with some. Okay. Or email a thought, maybe. If you've got a thought. Gervaisfm.co.uk could be a thought about anything. Can we not make those thoughts racist or homophobic, though, please? Yeah. Or not. Downers. No, nothing that's gonna bring us down, you know? Yeah. Upbeat stuff. Yeah, go on, Carl. You just. Do you know when you said 24 hours, then. Yeah. Do you know how much it takes to run one of the escalators on the underground for 20 hours a day? How much it costs a year to. Do that, to run it? How long? 20 hours a day. Yeah, that's what it runs. Is this another of your. Your facts? These are always. These are always substantiated by an independent source, aren't they? They're not just something you overheard on a bus, am I just. Just to check. This is fact on a wall in a sandwich shop. Sometimes I wish this was untelly because when Steve said this, you have these substantiated by an independent arbitrator. Carl just looked at him. Yeah. Like he just spoke in French. He just looked like that. Okay, so anyway, this. This information you've got from a reliable source, you read it on the back of a fag packet or something? No, I think it was in the Metro magazine in the week. Lovely. Okay, let's Just hear it again. How much does it cost? Yeah, there's loads of escalators in the. On the underground. Yes. And they run for 20 hours a day. Yes. Because. Don't tell us how. Tell you what, Carl, that's such a fascinating fact. Don't tell us. Let's play a record, Rick. Okay. And then people can stay tuned if they want to hear. This is like some sort of mental home radio. Yeah, isn't it? I mean, we, we are. I mean, we're not mentally ill. We haven't, you know, we have got any head trauma. We're educated people. Yeah. But we come out with just rubbish, gobbledygook, just nonsense. It's like I can't grasp. I don't know why he started saying. I've no idea what that thought was said. You just said 24 hours about doing radio for 24 hours. So I remember, I thought, oh, 20, 20 hours. Oh, God. So. So we're now. We're now examining the thought processes that we all have before we get to them. Let's just hear a story. Okay. Right, it's half past one and that film sounds good. That film sounds good. Feature, Feature. This is where I choose a song from a film that. Oh, that film sounds good. See, this is a film that me and Steve both love. And actually he saw it first and got me onto it and said, love it. And I did. It was Rushmore. It was a great film and from it, it features one of my favourite artists of all time. The Wind by Cat Stevens. And this is off the first album I ever bought from Teaser and the fire cut. This is the Wind from Rushmore. That film sounds good. Feature, Feature, feature. Cat Stevens, the Wind. Elegant. That's beautiful song. The album is. Is a superb album. It's. It's seminal. It's just. There's some great songs on there. I feel like playing another one. Maybe Song for the lovers. Maybe do it later. Maybe I can do that. Yeah, it's beautiful. I have to say I've seen the. The follow up to Rushmore. If you enjoy Rushmore, it's this new film, the Royal Tenen Mounds, with amazing cast, Ben Stillers in it, Gwyneth Paltrow and Gene Hackman in his Golden Globe winning the performance. Same sort of thing as Rushmore. Same kind of style, but lovely sort of kind of family comedy. Absolute dynamite. And again, a brill soundtrack. Nico is on there. Nick Drake, all kinds of treats forthcoming in the cinemas. Rick, you say the follow up, is it the. It's the same Director, same writer. Right. Some of the same cast. Bill Murray makes another appearance. The Swingers lot done another one. They have their new films made with the same John Favreau and Vince Vaughn. Again, dynamite. Really good fun. Not as kind of perceptive as Swingers, but certainly as much fun. Have you seen Swingers, Carl? I think so. Is it the one where they've got a line in it? They've got a catchphrase in it, haven't they? You're the money. Money. No, you're so money. That's it. Yeah, yeah, I've seen it. Yeah. Yeah. I love the fact that I said you're the money. You went. No, you went. You're so the money went. Yeah. Well, yours is from. What's his name? Yeah. Jerry Maguire. No, show me the money. Yeah, yeah, I've seen it. Anyway, that was really articulate. We had. We did a feature, it linked into film. Steve Films did a little, you know, off the cuff review, then it went into cobbled again. Yeah. I can't even say. You couldn't even say the word. Gobbledygook. It's. Yeah. Anyway, listen, you had an interesting fact you were gonna give us. Carl, I don't think we can leave people waiting for this any longer. No. Right. How much does it cost to run one escalator? That's just one. Yeah. On a London underground. It's running 20 hours a day because it shuts for four hours in the night when they're cleaning up and that. Yeah. How much did it cost to run it for a year? £12, £60,000. The trouble with these facts is I've got nothing to compare it against. Well, think about, like your yearly electric bill. Well, when you put it like that. When you. It's a lot in it. When you think they could just use stairs. Carl, play a song. Politics on XFM 104.9, please. People, just use the Stairs. Brothers star guitar. I'm gonna be honest, Steve. I like the video more than the song. Agreed. Good. I just wish we could maybe tape the bits we're not on air. Just because that's when Carl comes into his own. He just said to me, I was. I don't know, I was doing. I was sort of like pottering around, dancing around, doing something annoying, probably. And he just looked at me. I don't know, he was looking at me and I look back and he went, have you ever used a wife front properly? Genius. It's a great question because the answer is definitely no. Definitely as Ed. Does anyone use their wife Front properly. And by that I mean get your winky out of the little sort of slot provided as opposed to like put it to one side or pull them down or whatever. Has anyone used a wife front properly? I don't think I've ever done it. I don't think I've ever done it. I've never seen anyone in a toilet doing it. Rick, you should be looking. I wish I had said that. I caught you. Really? Yeah. That's actually how you prove people are gay. Yeah. Get them into this conversation. Yeah, yeah. It's a trap. Yeah, it's a trap. It was a trap. Yeah. I'm not gay, by the way. Yeah. You didn't prove I was gay. I double bluffed you because I knew the old gay trick. I thought it was the old gay Lord say no thing. That is another method. Yeah. There's innumerable methods of doing it. That's how Oscar Wilde was caught. Yeah. Yeah. What happened there? Well, the judge went to him just that film last night, Gaylord say no. And he went, no. And they went, take him away. Yeah. Take him down to the cells. Yeah. Take him to reading. It is true. Well, it originated in America. Yeah. So many of these things do. It's a brilliant point, Carl. I'd like to hear from anyone, anyone listening who's. And I mean, well, they'll just lie, wouldn't they? I suppose, yeah. I don't even use sort of flies usually. I sort of just sort of, sort of pull my wife on my sort of tracksuit. That's why I wear sort of like elasticated waist rattle. Just sort of like. Yeah, you gotta get in there with the minimum of effort. Yeah. We. And out. Sure, sure. Often I won't shake no to my detriment because it often leaks out a little bit later. Ever been out on a date with a girl where it's just trickled down your leg and you wish it hadn't? And you're thinking, what if she gets my trousers off later? She might smell or see it. What? I don't know. I don't know what I said there. Right. Rick, I had for Christmas something which I think might excite you and. Yeah. Because I know you're obsessed and interested by facts. Yeah. Don't fiddle with the microphone. Well, I was just looking at what it was underneath it. Stop. Listen to what I'm saying. I know. No, listen, let me explain. People could hear you moving the microphone. Could they? Yeah, I can hear in my headphones. You know, it's the little pop shield that Goes over the mic. I was gonna see way the mic was facing so I just had a look. No one's interested. Leave it Carl. I'll tell you if it's a problem. All right. Why am I talking like that? So this is a book. It's just facts and trivia. It's edited by Sir Isaac Asimov who I think's dead. So I don't know when my parents bought this book. I assume it's from a second hand shop or something. Right. But I got it for Christmas. I keep meaning to bring it in because there are generally the facts are quite sensible in here and I like to think if Isaac's been involved they're probably substantiated. It's not like kind of just this nonsense on the web or this is probably. Or up in Greg's the Bakers of. Carl gets most of his facts from the ancient Egyptians. Trained baboons to wait on tables. Carl fascinated. Brilliant. That's fantastic. My point about that is why did they stop? Yeah, it's g. That's a genius idea. Would you not want to go to a restaurant where they have baboons serving? No. I tell you what happened. It might have been like the planet the apes and they sort of rebelled. One of them could talk, one of them could take his order and one day when it went do you want fries with that? And the bloke got really annoyed and said to answering back. And then there was a. Some sort of rebellion. Right, right, right, right. The plan of the apes isn't true, is it? It's not, it's not documentary. Right, okay. I wonder because what I like the idea of having baboons is the fact that I reckon they're like. I have difficulty and I'm sure you do Carl, like working out that sort of 10, you know, on a bill. Yeah, I reckon baboons would find that particularly hard. I reckon you could get away with under tipping them all the time. Yeah, exactly. Just not leaving enough in this leg in it. Exactly. They go away and you go sucker. Yeah, exactly. So I'd love to see some baboon restaurants. There's any restauranteurs out there. So tell if you do get go. To a restaurant and you've been waiting on us, please don't order the banana daiquiri because it comes off eaten. They can't help their little selves. They really can't. They're okay with like you know, beef and steak and chips but there's a little bug I go do you, can. You imagine that the baboons serving at waiting tables. It's genius. Just stop to think about that. It's absolutely incredible. Yeah, it's absolutely dynamite. Yeah. See, zoos would be a lot more popular if that was like the canteen. You could go if they were serving tickets to two. Yeah. One child row. Okay. Go through there. I think they should do other things like in, you know, in the Flintstones, they used to mix cement in that bird's kind of pelican. Yeah. Yeah, we start doing that again. That also happened in ancient times. Yeah. Before they had proper cement mixers. That was how they did it. Definitely just animal facts. I remembered one in the week. Go on. It was. Do you know them two gay American men who have. Have tigers? Well, they're not necessarily gay. No one actually knows if they are gay. All right. Okay. Yeah. Gilbert and George, is it? No, that's those artists. They're called Siegfried and Roy. Anyway. Who may or may not be gay. Yeah. And if they are, so what? And if they are, so what? But if they're not. And they don't. I just said that so you knew I was talking about. Sure. Okay. The two gay ones. Yeah. Gone. Two possibly gay. Gay. Let's not worry about libel law anymore. Then I'll. If you shave a tiger's head. Whoa. Okay. You've gotta treat that sentence with a lot more reverence than you did. Think what you're saying. If you shave a tiger's head. Not just its head, its whole body. If. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Yeah, so I thought you. I thought you were getting weird. Go on. If you shave a tiger. Yeah, go on. It's still stripy underneath the skin. The skin. Is it like rock? It goes all the way through? Yeah. That's amazing. Where did you hear that one? That's. I remembered that. Was that a drunk just shouting it in the street? I shaved a tiger and it still strived to get out of here. Yeah. I must make a note of that thing's car. Yeah. That's an interesting fact. Well, you know, a polar bear. Polar bear's skin is actually black. And its fur is transparent, not white. And it gives the illusion. So it gets all the radiation possible from the sun, but it's still camouflaged. I didn't understand that, Rick. Sorry, you lost me. If it skins black, a polar bear skin. Black fur is translucent and it's. Fur is translucent. So why is it white when we. Well, it's just because the light hits. It and the sun reflects on it. Yeah. And it makes it look white. Yeah. If you look at each individual hair, it's actually translucent, so at night it would be black. Everything is. Is it? Yeah. Oh, not bright stuff, Rick. You've embarrassed yourself. Play a record. Oh, I know all about animals and stuff. Do you, Rick? Pod. Bit of pod there. Alive. That's grown on me. Yeah, it's not bad, you know, it rocks. I mean, we've got to give it that. I will certainly give it that, Rick. Yeah. XFM 104.9, Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant. So, more from the Facts and Trivia book edited, as I say, by Sir Isaac Asimov. So, not just overheard on the tube or by a drunk. Well, he might have overheard a one or two by a drunk and just put him on the floor. Listen to the whole fact here before you make any judgments. Okay. Sauerkraut was renamed liberty cabbage by Americans during World War I. Sure. In their denunciation of all things German, some Americans actually kicked Datsuns. Are they little dogs? Yeah, little German dogs. Just give them a kicking because they were German or they were derived from Germany. I don't know. If they got to, like, a small sort of French village and just said, bring out your dachshunds. Why, what are you gonna do to them? Nothing. Give them a little bit of food or something. You're not gonna kick them, are you? I've heard about you Americans. No, no, just bring out a little sausage dog. You said that aggressively. Well, no, bring up the little sausage dog. Okay. Well, you're not gonna hurt it, though. If you hear it now, it's like, it's against the Geneva Convention. I'm not gonna kick it. Well, I didn't even bring up kicking. I didn't even mention kicking. So why have you. Why have you done that? I don't know. Well, I haven't got a Datsun. Sacre bleu. Yeah, sorry. That thing down my trousers is just a baguette. Yeah. Do you remember that, Carl? Dynamite fact. A dynamite by Napoleon so he could carry him down his leg. There's one more here that I thought might. I know that there's a lot of those kind of amusing laws and stuff, antiquated laws and that, on the wedding things. But again, it's Asimov. I'm thinking it's true. City ordinance number 352 in Pacific Grove, California, makes it a misdemeanor to kill or threaten a butterfly. Threaten? Yeah. You can't even threaten a butterfly. Server goes, don't even look at it. Aggressively. Yeah. Butterfly comes down. I go, what are you looking at? I go, nothing. He goes, judge. What? Yeah, Looking at me with the net. Oh, what's he doing? Anything? What's he doing? I'm fishing. But what. See, the thing about that is a lot of the. Kind of, sort of the wilder butterflies from the wrong side of the tracks, they're just going to take advantage of it. They're going to cruise around, they're going to be playing loud music, they're abusing old people, they're untouchable. And they're going to go, have you got a problem with that? Exactly. And you're going to go, no, no, it's fine. Go about your business. No butterflies there, Rick, in California running amok. Yeah. Should repeat it. Yeah. No, there's another one I think you'll be a fan of. Oh, it might take me a while to find it. Maybe we should play a track. Oh, wow, that takes us nicely. That's a lovely link. That thing about. You said about playing a track. Keep going, keep going, keep going. This is Song for the Lovers and I've chosen a great track here by Lloyd Cole, oft forgotten, but a great singer, songwriter. This is one of his best songs, I think. In fact, I think Sandy Shaw covered it in the mid-80s when she had a little bit of that resurgence. It's are you ready to be heartbroken? And it's a song for the Lovers. Lovely tune. Are you ready to be heartbroken? Actually, Lloyd Cole with his Commotions. That was done with and I love it. Beautiful. Cheers. Facts and Trivia. The last one, Rick, go on. This is a sobering lesson for us all. Go on. At the Pan American Exposition In Buffalo in 1901, President William McKinley received a line of citizens shaking hands with each in the line was a man with a handkerchief covering one hand. Neither of the two Secret Servicemen guarding the President was curious enough to take a look at what might be under the handkerchief in the hand of the man, Leon Golsgols, an anarchist. What he had was a loaded revolver and when the President thrust his right hand out for the shake, Sol Gozd fired twice. McKinley died a week later. So what he did there, it was outwit the might of presumably the FBI or the Secret Service by covering the gun with a handkerchief. Clever. That's brilliant. It's absolute genius. Just think how they had to explain that. And they go, how did they get. How did he get close enough and shoot the President? They go, we didn't see the gun. Why? Covered it with a hanky Diddy. Oh, well, you're not to blame them. Exactly. We got. We can't compete with that sort of, you know. Didn't you think to look under the hanky? No. Well, just probably just thought it was a hand. Course. Because that's where the hand would be. Did you not think he was probably holding a gun or something? Did do that. We didn't train. We didn't do hiding it with a hanky, did we? All right, if you didn't do it, then it's not your fault. Don't worry about it. But he lived, did he? For a week. The president lived with it for a week. That's because they had to go to him. And they're probably shuffling around his bed going, sorry about that. Why don't you look? Did he? Oh, well, they're now in jail. Well, they were. Go on. Well, when we went into the jail to give them some bread and water, he had a hanky over his hand, right? Yeah, we thought nothing of it. Sure. And it was a gun. Yeah, the gun. And he got out, see. Do you remember the last. Remember the gun? Yeah. That's terrible. It's pathetic. No one's used that method since. It was effective there. But you don't hear about that now. Using all kinds of elaborate methods to assassinate people, Poisoning their wine. Yeah, I think that was Rasputin. As I recall, they put some poison into his wine. I didn't study it in history class. That's my memory of it. If only. Listen to Carl last week. Chink the glasses. Always chink the glasses. That shows that they used to test it, didn't they? Pour a little bit from yours into mine. That means I'm not poisoning you. Yeah, but if you're thinking of murdering. Someone, you know, with a gun. Yeah, but let's say hanky over it. Just think about that. Just pop a hanky. I don't know, pop it inside an oven glove and just wear that as you go. Do it with or sooty or one of those big gladiator style pointing foam hands that you have on gladiators. Yeah, that would be genius. I'm just using this because I love the. No gun in there, is there? No, just a big finger. Check if you want. Yeah, well, no, we won't then. If you said check. Right. Have I ever told you my method, Carl? My genius method of assassinating someone? This is brilliant. This is the ultimate crime. Is this the ice cube one? Have I told you before? No, but I know that. What's the ice cube one? When you shoot an ice bullet, you get someone round. Rick, don't Say it, don't reveal it, because it's my story to tell. I know two of them. Well, listen, let me tell you it and see if this is the one, right? This is genius, right? You rent a room across the street from the person you want to kill, right? And then when their windows open one day, right, what you do is. What you've done is you've made an arrow from ice, okay? And then what you do is you. You. You train, like, to become a brilliant marksman with a bow and arrow. It's an old one. It is what it's. This is why it's classic. And then you shoot them with the arrow. Then it goes across the street into their heart, kills them instantly. But what's brilliant is the arrow, the murder weapon. It then melts, dries out. There's no murder weapon. And then you can take apart another one, Steve. To stab him. Then stab him, then take out and walk away. Same no murder weapon. No, but you've got to get into the building. This is the point. You're across the street, you know, the only thing that could get you is if someone saw you shooting an arrow. What about an arrow on a string? Arrow on a string? What are you talking about? No, not an arrow on the string, because that's not gonna work. What if the string broke as you were trying to loot? Good point, good point, good point. No, the ice arrow is the only way. The ice arrow is the only perfect method of assassination. That was on Colombo. Was it? But there's another one. Do you know, like I was saying about the. The murder weapons. Irrelevant, Steve. What? The fact that it's a murder weapon, it's irrelevant. No, because fingerprints on it and stuff. Yeah. Frick. I defy you to win. There's no fingerprints on a bullet. When it goes through your head at 12,000, they can trace it to the. Right, the same gun, can't they? They can figure that out, throw the gun away. No, but they'll find the gun. They always find the gun. No, you can't bury the gun, Rick. My point is melt it. No, the point is his fingerprints and stuff. No, wipe it, Ricky, Never wear gloves. Wear gloves. They'll catch up with you. They'll always catch up. Will they? Oh, I won't. Then the ice arrow is the only way. I bet that was the one case that Colombo didn't solve. That was. That's one of them. The other one is. You know, I was saying the other week about the. The drinks and you chink your glasses and stuff. Yeah, A way around that. Put the poison in the ice cube. You quickly have a swig before it's melted. That's all right. I can drink that. It's not dangerous. Just say, oh, I'm gonna show you some pictures or something. Let the ice cube melt. The poison goes in the drink. Say, oh, knock that back. Yeah, you look thirsty. They'll have it. They'll die. Genius. That is good. Carl. You and I, man, we're like criminal masterminds. Yeah. What happens when they find the poison in the body and go, well, he was at Carl's house drinking. I might have been. You'd have legged it. He'd have been off with his misses and like £30,000 or whatever it was. Yeah. Wouldn't it? Yeah. So that's perfect as well, isn't it? It's a perfect crime. Hold on. Are all perfect crimes to do with ice? Pretty much. Roots maneuver, witness. We were talking earlier about people who use Americanisms like they've used all their life. And it's our pet hate, isn't it really? Like just people who say, I was dj. I look, you know, risk of sounding a little bit, you know, butt licky, but. Nicky. What's that? Never heard that. But don't say but. Yeah, I heard someone say he was on my ass. Oh, he was on my ass. Yeah. I've never. What. I'll tell you what almost annoys me almost as much as that is a guy to know who'd pretend. And this guy was like, he'd never done anything wrong in his life. He had no street cred whatsoever. And I was driving along with him once back from somewhere and a police car just pulled out and was just following us along the road because police cars sometimes do. Not following us. Just happened to be driving the same direction and he went, hey, up the pigs. Watch it. Like. Like what I was supposed to think, what, you've done some crime. Yeah. You're part of Grand Theft Auto 3. And we. I better be careful because you got some knocked out off gear in the back. Yeah. You'll watch. It's the bloody pigs or a dead cool play. A dead. A made man that he just killed in the boot. Nonsense. And it's. I just so annoyed with that kind of pretending to have street cred. I know just that one. I remember once, right, an American came to our school. We're all about 13 or 14. And he was just. He was like, you had to be his friend. And it was like people vying for his attention because he was sort of this cool American bloke, right? And he was like, good, good at sports, straight. He's always, you know, it's just great. And I remember someone saying like, tube, a toothpaste. And he. And he laughed, said, tube. Tube. Okay, what was it? I said, it's tube. It's tube, right? And people go, no, it's tubular. And they. It's tube, right? And I went, I say, tube. He went. And they sort of looked at me and they just thought, you liar. I said, no. I say, oh, let me just think. No, I say tube. When you're a kid, like any American you ever meet is the coolest thing. It doesn't matter if he's a huge fat bloke wearing Bermuda shorts and a camera on his neck. It's cool. Because they speak with American accent. Well, that is cool. And that's. And they say being a huge fat. Bloke in Bermuda shorts is cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what you keep telling yourself. I'm growing into that look, says Rick, the Canadian tourist. Absolutely. But no, so anything, you know, sidewalk. Yeah. I mean, if I could say like when I was sort of 14, if I could have said sidewalk, Fender, you know, I always wanted to go into a sandwich shop and just order something on rye. I want to be. What? I want to be one of those 80 year old sort of Yiddish blokes. There's, you know, sort of like old vaudeville Jewish guys that, you know, they sit in diners and talking like water. Matau talks. Right. Yeah. I want to, I want to grow into that. A long coat and I go, oy. Yeah, maybe I'll start. Yeah, well, convert to Judaism initially. Yeah. Be your first portal and then just tour the vaudevillian, you know, circuit. Yeah. In the cat skills. What am I, some kind of schmuck? Yeah, something like that. What you, Carl, are you. Would you like to be American? No, not at all. Really Got me nerves when I was in. Get on me nerves. When I was in Barbados at Christmas. Oh, right, yeah, there's loads of them there because that's. Was that when you were doing a bit of extra sort of waiting because your girlfriend was cleaning rooms, went there. For Christmas and there's loads of them there because that's like really close to America. That's like Blackpool east to Manchester type. It's exactly like that. That's the analogy a lot of Americans use. So I think they call it the tropical platform. But they're going on, they're selling all the brochures, I'm sure And serious now, but we're going on about the September 11th thing. Yeah. They call it the. Of course. This is American. Of course. Brilliant. The. The 9 11. The 9 11. That's what they call it, really. Oh, that's awful. That is. So it's like people who say 24 7. Yeah, my ass off. 24 7. Well, Americans that say that. Well, they're allowed, though. Oh, Americans are, yeah. I'm talking about an English person who might say it. Yeah. Fool. Yeah. No, that's terrible. Yeah. Do that American accent again. Yeah, of course. The, the 9 11. Where are you from? That's how they sounded in Barbados. Sure. But Carl doesn't. I very much doubt that. Carl likes new fangled countries like America. He doesn't like London. No, true. So he's not gonna. America. Yeah. Did you enjoy it? Went to Florida. No. The garment again. Got new. Yeah. When it went for some food. Yeah. And it was the last few days I didn't take much money with me and we were in Florida and we were hungry and we went for some steak and we had our dinner on that and it's, I think it's their equivalent to the Angus Steakhouse and sat down at the steak and that's huge, big portions. But anyway, we didn't have much money left and we had like another two days left, so we didn't leave. We didn't have much money for a tip. Do you know over there, they expect it. Yeah, a big tip. Yeah. So we left what we could and I don't know what it was. It might have only been the equivalent to 60 pence. Yeah. But he didn't have to do that much. We didn't have loads of courses because we didn't have much money. So he brought us like the main course and, I don't know, a couple of Diet Cokes and anyway, left him the 60p. Yeah. On the way out and he comes running over, excuse me, sir, you can have this back. Because it wasn't enough. I mean. Yeah, it's outrageous. What did you say? I said, all right then. Well, I needed it. I mean, I thought it was nice to leave them something, but obviously it wasn't enough, so he got us a couple of more. Is it good fun with you on holiday? I mean, do you enjoy yourself? Do people go with you on holiday? I get bored after about four days. You surprise me. What do you expect out of a holiday car? What do you, what do you. What do you go for? I'll soak up some of the culture. Yeah. You Liar. What did you learn about Barbados while you were there? A lot of crabs on the beach. Ah, I just imagine him sitting there with his knotted hanky on his head. I like that. Not bad. Bit of Gary Newman there. That's Richard X and Sugar Babes Are Freaks Electric. Is that one of those things where they've taken one song and they've laid it over the top of the other? Yeah. Brilliant. It's good now. No, it's good. Good. Yeah. Well, we're. We're nearly done. We are almost finished a couple of. Great tracks with a few laughs, maybe. We've had a few laughs, haven't we? Exactly. I've perked up. Yeah, you have. You have, yeah. You've lost it here a bit, though. You feel a bit. It sounds. It sounds like you're a bit down again. Well, that's just two hours work in one long stretch. I reckon we could do a three hour show now. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Skin of the teeth sort of just. Barely got away with this, really. This is beginning to fall apart now. It is, isn't it? Yeah. Oh, but, yeah, we've had a good time. We've had a few laughs. As I say, I just think a car on the beach. He said he started winding the crabs up because he got bored. He started throwing sand at them. It's like a child's experiment. When you were in California, you weren't aggravating butterflies, were you? Because. Oh, that's a misdemeanor. Scary though, the weather's really freaky. Where in California is it? Yeah, in the day. It's dead nice. Come six o'clock, goes black and then the rain comes down. It's freaky. Is that every single day, Carl? Was that just the week you were there every day? I was there for about a week. It happened every day. So as far as you're concerned, that happens all year round? Yeah. Good thing. So what you're saying is if people are booking a holiday, you should be conscious of this because it will always happen. California tours. I think it does. But why did you start throwing sand at crabs, by the way? Just because you get bored on the beach. You sat there, you look around and then I saw these crabs and I was watching the way they move around and. Yeah, funny, innit? Sort of to annoy you, the way they moved. No, I mean, it works for them. Good of you. But it was just what I was weighing up is they're quite close to the sea, so I was watching the sea. They like it close to see, don't they? Yeah, but they don't like it too close. No. So, like the sea was coming close to them. They'd run towards me. Yeah. So as the sea came into to them, I was chucking sand the other way and it was like, ooh. They didn't know what to do. They didn't know where to go, really. How long did I keep you occupied? For the last three days. Was there. Have you ever seen. I don't know if I've described this before. Do you remember a classic Paul Daniels episode where Paul is having tea with some baboons? I think chimps full circle and he's got a little box and inside the box is a mirror and he gives it to the chimp and it looks in the box and it's confused by its own reflection. It can't figure it out. So it's looking behind the box, trying to figure out, is there another monkey behind it? Yeah. It goes on like that. It's dazed and confused. It was there for. For weeks, just staring into it. I imagine you're a bit like that. That's great. I think that's my analogy. Poor Daniel's chimps. Yeah. I kept a crab once for a week when we went to Bognor. It was me and my nan. Oh, party time. Oh, man alive. You haven't lived until you've woken up. The sound at 3 o'clock in the morning of your nan having a wee in a tin bucket in echoing around a caravan. Yeah. I was about nine. You brought a chick back. I was about nine. Right. And I just kept a crab in a first hour in the bucket. I don't know where it came from. No, I found it on the beach and I bought it back and I kept it in a little bowl in the sink. And then the last day, it started to smell a bit. And then the last day, Mum said, go and put it back. And I went and put it back. So I had a pet crap for a week. And did it. Did it die? What happened to it? No, no, it was. It just got bored. Sure. It says it didn't do a lot. Did it start throwing sand at you? Listen, I think we better play some more because we've got a few songs to squeeze in. I just wanted to play a track. I was watching MTV the other day and I was a bit confused. Yeah. So was I like that because I saw a video for the electric soft parades. Silent to the Dark. But it was called Silent to the Dark 2. But it was the same song. It sounds like they've redone it. The video is different to the old video. I was very confused. Hopefully someone will phone in and solve it for me. Anyway, this is the original Silent to the Dark. Still a good track. Let's hear it, Carl. Silent the Dark, the debut single by the Electric Soft Parade. I like that. Yeah, very good. Very good choice. Apparently discovered by xfm. Is that right, Carl? Yeah. Sent a tap into Claire Sturges, you see, Big time now. What does she do with it? And sold it. Yeah. Got a little 5 pound starter bag of skag. Exactly. And the rest is history. Well, I've enjoyed myself, I have. But can I just say, we don't just like, you know, muck around and do stupid things and play great music. We're also informative. And I leave London with this tip that Carl, for no reason, just told me. Do you want to do it, Carl, or Schleicher? On what you just said, Rick, we. Haven'T got much time. You better explain it. Okay, if you. He said you've been on the Millennium Wheel. I went, no. He went, well, if you do, here's a tip. Go when there's lots of disabled people on there. And I was up for it. I went, why? He went, you get more for your money. Because I have to keep stopping and letting them off. You get an extra six minutes. Good solid advice if you're gonna get there today or tomorrow. Thanks. Song for the ladies, Rick. I'll leave you with Lamb Chop. A lot of people aren't a fan of Lamb Chop. For some reason they don't like the way he sings. But this is a beautiful song with people. See ya. Bye.",
