  "text": "Richard Ashcroft, Check the Meaning on XFM 104.9. We're back, Steve. It's Saturday. That's true enough. Steve Merchant, that is. Hello there. I'm Ricky Gervais. Carl's still away. Claire Sturges is back. That's absolutely true. Hello there, Claire. Nice to see you. I think a lot of people were hoping that Carl will be back this week, but we're pleased to have you. No, they were actually. I did get some emails during the week. Saying what? Just saying it's really nice to, you know, hear you again on the Saturday afternoon. It's nice. And. But. But you're not really very funny. And when's Carl coming back? It wasn't to us. No. No, because they think that as well. But no one can compete with Carl. Well, we used to sort of like, come, come in. And when we discovered Carl early on, we just thought, this is comedy gold, just let him speak his mind. But then we started thinking, oh, we can't follow him, though. So I remember Steve going, look, we've got to come up with some stuff. We need to chat. If anything, we've got to say to each other. We've got to say that in the first 20 minutes. And then you just unleash Carl. Yeah. Because it's just you can't follow him. And he's. He's off on one. And they have stories of upbringings with bizarre creatures that lived in Manchester that would. Half human, half bat and frog and things. I'd love to take him back to Manchester in some kind of TV documentary, you know, when Carl went home and just wandered back, maybe try and find the amphibian twins or whatever those people were. Yeah. So there was two. Two boys, both had big heads and webbed feet. They weren't related. They did. They didn't hang around with each other. That was all the information we had. I went, why not? He went, that would have been too obvious. Like, they look at each other across a room and go, yeah, you think I'm gonna come over to see you just because we' because we're a similar species. Yeah. You're mistaken, mate. You make your own friends. One starts to walk over there, one shakes his head and just mouths, too obvious. Yeah, out of one of his mouths. Yeah. That's what they're expecting. Yeah. Don't do it. Don't do it, Webby. Yeah. But anyway, he'll be back. Sure. Shortly. I'm sure. He phoned me. His dad's ill. His dad's in hospital. So Carl went back to sort of look after his mum. He was so sweet. He said, I'm back here, just driving my round. He went. He said so unbegrudgingly, he just went, it's like old times. And I said, sorry to hear that. And he went, that's all right, yeah. And. And I think it's gonna be fine. And I said, how was your holiday? He went, yeah, we're good, except it were a nudist beach. Didn't tell me. Of course it was. What do you mean? He went, wow. Sitting on the. I don't know why they have to do it. I don't know why they have to do it. Why do they have to do it? He went, suzanne said, they think there's nothing wrong with it, like being a transvestite. Right, right. I went, I love the fact that your girlfriend has to tell you what's wrong. And right in the world. He went, well, we walk along the beach. Fellow coming towards us, whit knob out o. I went, oh, what's going on here? And he said. He said, and because it wasn't all nude, he's walking around, he's stark naked and he wants the freedom of that, but he's got a big rucksack on his back with his clothes on just to get changed. He went, so what's the point in that, right? And I went, he should just carry the book. He went, what? And covered it up. When he went, he went, oh, yeah, good idea. See? He went, but I wasn't happy. He says, and that was the first day, so we didn't go there again. I just imagine his little face, yeah. Just going, all right, that's out, that's out. What's that doing out? Why has he got his out? I imagine Carl sort of dressed in a suit, in a sort of safari suit, done right up with a cravat. I'm not undressing. I don't want people seeing the flesh. That's for you, love, and no one else. But I love the fact that I just. Carl, they don't think there's anything wrong with it. They're just happy that way. And he, in his own mind, just goes, look, being a transvestite, he knows there's nothing wrong with that. I'm always a little bit suspect about people who like walking around nude. I thought you meant transvestite. No, no. Nudists. What? Hold on. Can you say naked transvestite? What are you, then? Yeah, I suppose you're a Will. Eddie Izzard's naked, is he? A naked transvestite. That's an interesting metaphorical metaphysical question. Yeah, yeah. On XFM 104.9 if you know the. Answer to that metaphysical question or indeed any of the famous ones. If a tree falls in a forest, no one hears it. Has it fallen over any of those then? Any of those. That's brilliant. If you leave the room, Rick, what's the sound? Yeah, what's the sound of one leg hopping? Exactly. What we got there? Claire, do you want some music or. Yeah, I'd love to hear it. I want the vines actually. Oh, play it, play it, play it. Hey Claire, out of the way. No, I'm not talking to you. It's the. It's the name of the song. Where the vines. Excellent. Yeah. X Men 104.9 I'm Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merch. Hello there. And Claire Sturges. Have you ever been to. Have you ever been to a newly. Speech? Have either of you been to a new speech? Yes, I found. Have you really? I. I know last month I went on holiday to Antigua and then I went on the nudist beach. Really I wanted an all over sure. Because I. I was with my family once when we went on holiday, family. Holiday with I'm going on and an inspector coming on going. And the glasses. And the glasses and you don't wear them there. No, I went there with. It was some friends of my fans like family friends, you know, like kids. So it was kids my age and my sister's age who. And parents were all friends, you know, go on holiday to this end up on this New Year's beach. Not. Not a new speech but where people sunbathe topless or whatever. Or maybe. Maybe it was just because. Maybe it was just because it was France where I think a lot of. That goes on generally beaches in. Yeah, yeah. That's different. Our news beaches, they're cordoned off. Sure. Yeah. With the cocks and everything. We can't say that. You can't say cocks or. Did you mean the chicken? You meant the chickens. A lot of. A lot of male golf farms, a lot of French farms. Birds around. There is a lot of poultry and. By male bird I don't mean transport. No, I don't want it because that's also. That's offensive. That is also offensive. So be careful whenever. Please be careful, Claire. Be careful what you're going to say. Or anyone listening when we say we are referring to a male bird and. And there is no discussion there. There's nothing. There's no other issue. There's no other ambiguity. Okay, go on. So there's people walking around with their birds and. And. And often they got their knobs out as well. And. And so. No, no, no. It was just a topless. It was just a topless beach. So we're all there. So there were tits there as well? There were some tits. We've got a family of tits that come and eat the nuts. That chew on my nuts. Go on. We're confusing. We're confusing. No, no, we have. Jane's got a little bag of nuts that she makes me hang out of the window. Right, so. So you'll often be hanging your nuts out the window and the tits can. God, I don't know what. Please get on with this story. Sorry. So what I'm saying is. God. What I'm saying is. Yeah, we went on. There was a family there. There was some tits, there were some clocks. And. And I found it all a little bit. Because I was about 14 or something. I found it all a little bit disturbing because I hadn't been introduced to this sort of thing before and obviously my dad was having none of it, like, a bit like Carl. And obviously my mum wasn't up for that, as I. But the person we went. The mother of the person we went with, she. She took her top off and I was like. I was. I didn't. I didn't know where to look because I didn't want to make an issue of it. I didn't want to make. You know, I didn't want to. But it was like. Because I was in my mate. I was going, well, I wanted to say, well, there's your mum with her knockers out. I mean, that's your mum over there. Hello, Dave. There's your mums. There's your mum. There's your mum's knock. Oh, there's your dad. There's your dad. Popped out. Yeah, popped out. Isn't this little man, his little fellow out there? Dad's fellas there. He's wandering about and he's having it and you remember. So it was all of them. It was a little bit disturbing. And I've never quite got that. That image out my head, really, because it was. It was all. But I didn't know where to look. I didn't know. A friend of mine, I won't say his name is right, he's about 25 now, when he was, I think, 14 and 15, I mean, the worst age, he went to a nudist holiday with his parents and. And his and his sister and some of her sister's friends. And he absolutely hated it. Yeah, absolutely. Well, that's, I, I, I. It makes me, I'm sort of queasy to think about it. Especially if you're with your family and friends. Yeah. Because it's, I don't mind looking at nudie ladies that I don't know, really. But I don't want to look at relatives, you know, or people I've grown up with or indeed the likes of you. I don't want to have to see that kind of flesh and I don't want to, I don't want to know what's going on underneath those clothes. You've keeping them hidden from me. Well, you haven't. You've shown me much of it in the time I've known you. Sometimes there's not, you know, there's not a bit of your body I haven't seen. At some point, you know, you'll have got your trousers down. Look at the arse. That was, you know, thinking that was hilarious. Or the old, you know, Johnson feeding. The, the birds on the windowsill. But yeah, no, it is strange because, you know, there isn't, there isn't anything wrong with it. Let's face it. There isn't anything wrong with it. But I know what you mean. I think it's because we spend so long, we spend so much of the time covering it up, you know, it's like, it's like in the summer months when girls start wearing kind of short sleeve T shirts or short skirts. You have blokes just going mental. I think it's because we spend, women spend most of the year because, because it's so cold here covered up that men forget what's under there, you know, and then when summer comes, when they. Do actually just hang out of a car window or hang over scaffolding and say, get your tits out. I want to go. Has that ever worked? Has it ever worked? As have you. And what's your success rate with that? Well, I was off to my big job in the city, but I got 20 minutes. Why should I come up there? Are you gonna come down? Oh, dear. Extraordinary. Oh, right. What we got, what we got coming up, what we got coming up quick. Keep them hooked. Well, you know, Rick, we've got some. Songs and some more chat. There'll be some chitter chatter and there'll be some songs. We had an email last week from a fella calling himself Paul. I don't know if that's his real name. He said that Sometimes I'm already suspicious. He said that sometime ago we played a cracking Johnny Cash cover version of U2's one. Remember that? I think maybe the last time you were here. And he says he's been trying to track down that album. Unfortunately, like an idiot, I didn't listen to it and I didn't catch the name of the album. Could you by any chance send me the album? He's having a laugh. He's having a laugh. What, for free? Yeah. So that's not gonna actually email him back, say, paul, can I do it now? Give us. Give us eight quid for no reason. I've also. I've also called him some quite offensive names. I'll put from Gervais. Oh, dear. He's not like that. That's pretty grim. Nor's his mother. No, he shouldn't have brought her into it. Indeed. Johnny Cash. Oh, Johnny Cash. Change from a Durex machine. Oh, that's Johnny Cash and his cover of U2's One Magnificent Tune. That's from the album American 3 Solitary man, that was released in 2000. And I've just checked that email that Paul, if indeed that is his name, sent us, Rick. And he didn't ask for a copy of the album, he asked for the name of the album. Right. So I feel a little bit bad that I sent that email back, insulting him and his mother. Yeah. And also, of course, I cc'd it to his mum as well and many of her friends. Send another one. I feel. I think we can get around this. I'll tell you what Paul would like, if that is his name. Yeah. He'd like some adverts. We'd love some bloody adverts. Paul. Oasis, Little By Little on XFM 104.9. I'm just moving the mic there. Hold on, I'm getting comfortable. There you go. Right, sit up. I was like, a lot of people do that. A lot of people do that during the song. A lot of their pros. Not a lot of the old pros. Like Foxy, they were on top of Ops yesterday. But they. They did my generation. Any good? Yeah, very good. I mean, you know, was it close. To the original or did they make it their own? No, both. It was pretty close. They did, you know, musically it was close, but, you know, that. That was it. Noel singing or Lil Liam. Very, very cool. Very cool attitude back, I think, back on four. Tell me, though, that if you go to any of these big stadium gigs they do now, it's an absolute nightmare because a lot of fans are really grim. I mean I've spoken to two people independently who've both been at gigs where there have been fans weighing another fan's shoes. That's not what I want from it. That's not nice. Well, yes, apparently that's theirs then. If you wee on something. Yeah. You own it because cat law. Yeah, Cat law is if you wear something then you own it. Yeah, I know you live by cat law because I. Yeah. No wallet, I think you own. And several telephone boxes. Much of my hair. What were we talking about? We were talking about nudie beaches. Yeah. Because I just, I still can't get around. I don't know why they only play volleyball. No, that's all they do. There's other games you could play. I think French cricket would be slightly more. All the pictures I've ever seen of nudes colonies always seem to be quite attractive women in some fairly grizzled sort of 45 year old men. I don't know if that's generally the clientele that, you know, it just happens to work that way. But I'm quite looking forward to getting to around the 45 mark and just cruising down. Happy birthday. Right, I'm off. Where are you going without your clothes? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And at what point? I mean you can't, you can't go into a nudist colony, can you, without taking your clothes off? I don't know if there's a door policy. No, I think there is, I'm sure. Oh, actually no, because when I went my nudist beach there was actually a. Security guard stopping you from naked. No, no, no, Claire, that's very. Would it be possible for a bloke who would say a fairly good swimmer to swim up to the beach in a wetsuit? Let's say just say for the sake of it that this person, you know, had some time on his hands. Yeah. You know, and he was, he'd make quite a bit of money. He trained nine hours a day at the lengths in the pool thinking if I can go, I can get. Yeah, yeah. Eurostar de France. It could work. It could work, yeah. So what was your nudist beach experience? This was not. This was not a colony. No, no. This was a choice that this, this place had a few beaches. One of them was a nudist beach. Could you see the nudist beach from the regular beach? No, you couldn't. You see it was just around the beach. What about with binoculars? Possibly, possibly. But you see, my, my, my worry is as, as a healthy Young man. Yes. You're not healthy, young man. No, no, but I'm talking about you two. Right. Sean, you're pretty healthy young men. How. How awkward it must be for you on a nudist beach if you do happen to see a very good looking naked lady. What you do. If you. Well, that's the reason I. That's the reason I've not gone to any. Okay, just exactly that worry. Because it is very off putting. Yes. If you had you. It sounds like this is a confession. Exactly. Yeah. What did actually happen to us? An older gentleman. An older gentleman obviously was enjoying his time on the beach. Right. Explain more. And then came over to chat and you just don't know where. Sorry. So hang on. So he. He approached you? Yeah. For a chat, as you do. People are friendly. Right. Without wishing to get too lewd within a state of arousal. How far can we go down? No, I'm not, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not trying to sort of. I don't want to get too kind of, you know, graphic. Organic. Have you noticed how quiet Ricky was keeping? So he came over. He came over. Well, I'm worried about this. I'm worried about telling this story. I think it's an interesting. I'm interested. I. This is an interesting point. Yeah. Because it's a. So he came over and he was just chatting away. Yeah. Quite proudly. Yeah. Yeah. And what was. Why was this time. We're not wishing to be disrespectful, but, you know, he's a man, he's been around a bit. Were you reading erotic poetry? What were you. I was talking about the weather. Right. How nice it was today. And he. He approached in pole position or did he? No, I don't like it anymore. Fine. Okay. I don't like it anymore. Let's leave it then. Let's leave it. That's what I did. I actually ran away. You ran away? That's swimming. Was he French, was it. Was it quite tricky to speak to him? Well, no, no, he spoke perfect English. Sorry. During the, during the break, Claire said, oh, I won't lose which ones. Right. And this man came over, an old fella. And. And she started off. I said, he had the biggest knob I've ever seen. And then I laughed. And then she went. And then he. Then it got bigger and I went. You can't tell it then. I was worried about that. But she left out the funny bit and just went. You just went all. Yeah, so play Bob Dylan. Only Bob Dylan can get us out of this. This is off his. His last album, Love and Theft. It is the only track I really like. I'm afraid I didn't get on with the rest of the album because it was too. It was too hoe downy and country blues and stuff, which is just not my sort of thing. But this is. This is a nice track called Mississippi, Mississippi Offer off the album Love and Theft. I must admit not. Not my favorite Dylan album. But that's a nice track, isn't it? It's a lovely track, actually. I just noticed that you've. You've brought in three CDs. Yeah, you bring those three in every week, don't you? You just play from those three CDs or. What, do you substitute the Dylan for different Dylan albums? Yeah. And the other two remain the same? Well, no, I've got. No, I've got them playing a different. Different Cat Stevens. I've got T for Tillerman. I've never bought that in before. No, I've never brought in. I've never played anything off T for Tiller, man. I played it off Catch Bullet 4, Teaser In a Fire, Cat. You don't have a sort of deal with Island Records to try and keep that Steven's back catalog afloat? No one's really shifting it. I think it might just be CDs that are in the bottom of a bag. This is why. It's just. You've got one carrier bag that you bring back. Exactly. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we'll look forward to those later. Yeah, go on. No, no, no, no. I was just. I was just really wondering, Rick, and I don't want to put you on the spot, but could I have some adverts? Yeah. Feeder Come back around on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. Hello there. Steve Merchant here. Of course you are. And. And so is Claire Sturges, in a way. That's true enough. That's true enough. Yeah. Rick. Oh, I parted till it was. I parted last night, Rick. Like it was 1999. Really old fashioned. Took away some old records. Yeah. On my own in my flat crying just like 19. No, I went to see Prince at the Hammersmith Apollo and I tell you this, I mean, if that's a man whose career is going down the pan, then I'm sorry, then I hope ours does. Then I hope ours does as excitingly as that does. Because he was stunning. I mean, he is. A lot of people I know have seen him in the 80s or whatever and he's. When he Used to descend from a ceiling in a little red Corvette and stuff. But he is breathtaking. He's like, he's like what it must have been to see Elvis Presley. I've not seen anyone who's electrifying on stage. I mean, I think like most people had a bit too much for him and that wasn't because his. It was going downhill. It's because he churned out double albums like most people churn out singles and you don't know what you should. You can't take it all. There was just too much. Yeah, I didn't like that, you know, the, the sort of the end of the 80s phase either. Too much. But that whole period when he was fighting with Warner Brothers and he was, he started wearing masks. I think everyone just thought, I'm not interested. Yeah, you know, you're a potty. But he's going to come out the other side of that. Great pop tunes and he's written. I mean, I, you know, I don't bandy this word around, Rick, as, you. Know, go on, but I'd like to. Use the word genius. I thought you're gonna say, I'll pay for that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Genius. Oh, wow. Genius. Because I would say strong words, Steve, they're strong words. Have you got any example of his work that we could play now on XFM to show that he is a genius? I. Well, I will in just one second, thanks for asking. But can I, can I try and justify that? Can I just. Because it is a controversial phrase to use. Prince is a genius and let me tell you why. On his first album, maybe on a couple of his first albums, he played all the brilliant, like Squidly Diddly. In one episode of that I saw Diddly was playing the piano with his two tentacles. Then he was like playing drums with two tentacles at the back. He was standing on two tentacles, which was the other one free for trumpet. That sounds like genius to me. Yeah, that's what Mr. Prince. The only thing I would say about the concert last night, three hours. He played for three hours non stop. Well, almost three hours non stop. Didn't take a break, but cracking band, only five. Taking a break, just reading the paper, having a coffee, going, what are you looking at? And also very good. 20 minutes by law. Very witty as well, because a lot of people imagine him being quite dry and quite sober. It was very funny. But sadly, Prince now, well, I don't mean to be offensive. As far as I'm concerned, he, you know, he's Now a Jehovah's Witness. He's now a Jehovah's Witness. He's gonna come round tonight. Well, no, but at the end he did sort spout on about, you know, his beliefs. Yeah. And I felt a bit like I'd sort of. Do you know what I mean? Like, I'd sort of paid 40 quid and I'd queued up and I'd sat for three hours to then be preached at a little bit. So that was the only thing that put me. Well, I'll tell you what, good job for him. He was good value. He'd have got an earful from you if he did. Imagine if he'd not played the singles or. I needed like 20 minutes. Yeah, well, I'd have been livid. I'm out of here. But. But I did because. I don't know. So you've had interesting. Steve Merchant says Prince is a genius. This is XFM 104.9 coming up to 2:00. Prince is a genius. Can we open the phone lines, please? What's the phone number there, Claire? 08700 800-123. Me and my mate were talking about when people say genius and they do band it around willy nilly and it's sort of like a comedian or something, I go, he's a geni genius. And we think that there's. There's people in cancer research sort of laboratories and age, but they're going, we lost another one to itv. Yeah. Why didn't he go into science? He could have been the new Newton, but now he's getting the ratings up for five. Exactly. So. But, But Prince is a genius. Is he? Ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk if you'd like to email Prince. Genius or Little Fella, it's up to you. But when you are Jehovah's Witness. I don't know. I don't know much about the. The face, but are you. Are you obliged when you sign up to sort of do your time going door to door? Because it would be amazing. Imagine Prince turning up at your door and just. How can I come in? Well, and it. You know, and just coming in and. Well, I'll sing you some of the hits, but I'd like you to buy a copy of this afterwards. I'm not really interested. Which ones are you gonna play? Which ones are you gonna play? I'm not a big fan of. I don't like if I was your girlfriend did anything from Diamonds and Pearls? I'm not interested in so shoot off. Yeah, I can't because I thought they. Were gonna start selling the Watchtower at the end. The most beautiful. I like that one. Yeah, well, there's those fat people in it. Does it make. It. Does it make him a genius? Oh, call up 1-23-596-4429. Prince, genius or bloke with hair. Well, this has got to be proof of his. Of his genius. He played it last night and it's just dynamite. It's Strawberry Scarlet. Prince, of course, and Raspberry Beret, one of the tunes you played last night. And breathtaking. I have to say, I can't sing his praises enough. Although didn't manage to get myself into the after show party where Prince is often renowned for playing with the likes of. Jamming with the likes of Rolling Stones. What would have been your. Your approach? Steve Merchant here, xfm. Ricky Gervaisa. Any chance I could come in to your party? To your party? Please. I'll be honest. Can I. Can I call you Lanky? Well, if it helped me get in here. It won't, but thank you anyway. I'll be honest, Lanky. Your chances are slim to none, four eyes. Okay, all right. I. I enjoyed the concert, if that is any. Okay. I could talk about it on the radio. I'll talk about on the radio. Take away that slim. Okay, it's none now, Freak. Okay. Okay. All right. So go away. Yeah. Cheers. Okay. Was it something like that? It was not dissimilar, Rick. More profanity last night and. And punches were thrown. Was it last night? Yeah. All right. Yeah, it's breathtaking. I. How's it working out for you, Rick? How's it working out for you, being a celeb? How is that working out? How's that panning out for you? Is that all right? Is that working all right, Rick? Is it? Hey, all the fame and everything, I was. I was David Bowie on Tuesday. I read about that. Why. Why did I have to. Why did I have to read about your presence at the David Bowie gig in the Evening Standard? Why'd you keep that? Why'd you keep that from me? Right? Okay, Right. I know what you're thinking. I got an invite. It was free business. Because I discussed this in the past. I said, if you get invited to David Bowie or any of the big name concerts, I gotta go as well. That's the rule. The rule is that we make the TV show, you're in the show, you become famous. Fine, but I need to be able to also get the benefits of that. Well, I didn't go. Was, did you read this in the Stand? Yes, I did. Yeah. No, it said. Well, it was in the paper. It was in the paper. It said present at the concert. It's absolutely true. I'm not fooling you. Absolutely true. In the concert where Ricky Gervais and Jonathan Ross. Now, we were invited, but we couldn't go. Neither of us could go. So they just, I just think they must have seen a copy of the guest list or someone said they'll come, or they just guessed, but I didn't go. I couldn't go. So there you go. It was Wednesday and I couldn't go. If I'd have gone, you'd have been there, mate. Rubbish. Because what worries me is that you, what, you, you were invited or, or you requested tickets and then you didn't go. No, no, what happened was the Bowie's people just said, are you coming to the concert tonight? And I, I, I, I said, I, I couldn't. But let me tell you something. Let me tell you something. Wait a minute. To get you off this track, right? The next night we did go to dinner with Bowie at someone's house. But wait, right, listen, it was a very, it was a small affair. It was, it was done. Me and Jane, Jonathan and, and Jane. It was David. First names. Yeah. No, no, and I think it was old friends of the family. It was a beautiful house and it was just us lot and Richard E. Grant and Pete Townsend and Charles Saatchi and that. And it was just, just, you know, I think it was this. And it was set places as well, so I couldn't have got another. It was weird because we got there, we, I mean, it said 8 for 8:30. And I got there at like 5 past 8 and January. We can't go too early. And we went in there and we, the, the, the, the, the servants gave us a, a drink and we were standing there and I was looking around. It was an amazing house. It was a beautiful house. And there's Damien Hurst paintings and Lucian Freud. And I thought, when the host comes in, I'm gonna go. You didn't tidy up for us, did you? But I was actually so overwhelmed. And in through the door. Door, Let himself into the door, Richard D. Grant. And I went, all right. He went, yeah, I'm Richard. Yeah, all right. And I went, just, just let yourself in. But yeah, I live next door. I went, oh, okay. And then, and then David Bowie came in and he came over and spoke to me and he's, he went, I've just seen your video and. And then. This isn't helping, is it? Because you're with you. This isn't helping. Well, when you. I mean, the phrase I was just gonna pick you up there on was, I've just seen your video, cuz. Cuz. What? What? No, I just feel that. What? Just, Just for a second. What, What I feel. What I feel that David should know is that it wasn't made sort of solely by you or. Or written entirely by you or directed entirely by you if it happens to feature you amongst a myriad of other actors, all of whom are brilliant and equally worthy of an invite to that particular dude. But you'll notice that the person that's representing the show. What got you a place around this table, you know, it's. The one person that was invited is you. Yeah. Just. Just, just you. Yeah. Well, that's a very good reason. And a woman. What? You know, who wasn't involved with the show. Your girlfriend. Well, your partners. You got, you know, that's it. Yeah. But once again, she could have stayed at home. You could have gone in on hello. Well, I did actually say if ever I get invited to see Woody Allen and it's two people, that it would have to be you and Jane that went because you're both bigger fans of me. And I promised that. And so she went along with that. So David enjoyed the show, did he? He did, yeah. Yeah, yeah, he did, yeah. And. And how did the evening pan out? Was it suitably rock and roll? It was very nice. It was really nice. A pleasant. What did you have to eat? I had. There was nibbles sort of coming round. And then they fed you the food, didn't they? I bet you. I bet they fed you the food. Food. And then we had. Oh, what was it? It was for starter. Oh, it was like a ravioli thing for starter. I thought, I won't have too much. I fill up for the fish dish. The fish was lovely. Then there was a sort of chestnut mousse. And what did you talk about with David Bowie? Just, you know. You know music. Yeah. You appearing on his next album? Yeah, yeah. No. What? Seriously? What? Because I'm interested to know. It was really nice. He's really. He's really so nice and normal. And he actually came over and he said, I've just seen your video. And he went. He said, are you gonna get the band back together? He meant he'd seen the room 101. And he was basically taking the mickey out of me. And he was going, oh, I thought it was really good and because you. Were just a sort of Bowie rip. Off on you, essentially. And. Yeah, and no, it was really, really nice and normal affair. Seriously. It was just really. I mean, I was going, oh my God, they're so and so. They're so and so. But it was really. We really enjoyed it. It was really pleasant and everyone was, you know, end the. The. The people whose house it was, who. Friends of his, like, sort of really old friends of his got a photo album just like you do. And I switched to like David Bowie and Dave. Yeah, sure. Well, no, I mean, that's great thing. About DB and Iggy part when they're cooking. And David was sort of going, look at Iggy cooking. And he was laughing like you do a mate you haven't seen. It was so sweet. It was just so nice. And then I'm going to. I'm going to see the Play record. Claire. Cuz it is actually a little bit annoyed with me Play Record. Then Robert De Niro popped in. Yeah. And it all got a. And Woody Allen. Yeah. And he went, do you know anyone that likes my work more than you know? I don't think so. I don't think so. Coral Dreaming of you on XFM 104.9. Yeah. One of the. One of the only tunes on the album, I think, worth listening to. I haven't heard it. Oh, it's rubbish. Is it really? Everyone's singing its praises like they're the saviors of British rock, but it just sounds like the Inspirable Carpets and I don't mean that as a good thing. Skeleton key as well. That's not too bad. Yeah, but the rest is. I think it's not. I think it's more sort of like 19, sort of 78, 79, sort of those. I don't know what that means. Well, I don't think. I don't think I've ripped off the 90s, I think. Old hat, you mean? Yeah, sure, yeah. Like it. Let me just return very briefly to your. Your. No, I don't. I'm not gonna embarrass you, but just returning very quickly to your. Your dinner date with David Bowie. What. What intrigued me, as you say that, is that when you. No, it wasn't. It wasn't because of the office. It was through, I think, because I met him with Jonathan Ross, people he'd met over this time, because I think he's going back to America. Of course. But I love the fact you say that he came over to you and said, I saw your tape last night. I just like the idea that people are sort of saying, you'll be having lunch tomorrow with Ricky Gervais. I don't know who that is. Well, there's a tape. Watch that and you'll be able to engage in some conversation. He's a minor celebrity here in Britain. He's had a relatively successful TV show, but we think he's a bit of a one trick pony. Probably won't be able to repeat that success, so probably wouldn't need to be eating with him in the next five years. But be polite tomorrow. He was a big fan of yours. He used to embarrass himself in the 80s, doing a sort of vague pastiche of you. And other than that, there's not much else to say, really. Just be polite to him and then move on. Okay. Who else has got. You know, it's just sort of. It's very odd that he was given a tape. It's like someone, you know, if you were doing a chat show, you imagine Michael Parkinson would be given a tape. I know, yeah. Just watch this, David. Oh, actually, I think he's been a fan for a long time. I think he's followed my career from the 80s. Sure. No, yeah. When you put it like that, it's not as flattering, is it? It's free. He was very nice and very polite and we got like a house on fire. Sure. No, it's great. Did you do your impression of him? No, of course. Did you not. Did you feel like the urge to snap into it just occasionally and I didn't, I didn't. I was just going, that's David Bowie. That. Yeah. All. That's still David Bowie. That's David Bowie talking to me now. Yeah. Oh, that's David Bowie talking to me now. Yeah. That looks like David Bowie. Yeah, that was what was going through my head. Yes. And we're talking about his songs and like, that was bizarre. It was. It was quite, quite surreal. And you know, and I do know a lot about his stuff because, I mean, he really, he. I mean, he's quite a musical hero of mine. Yeah. And that. So it was. You didn't mention Tin Machine. I didn't mention Tim because I'd just. Be there just thinking, don't mention Tim Machine. Don't even bring it up. Don't even. Don't even say you like it because you don't know what he feels about it. You see, I think if people listen to this show, they go, don't invite Steve Merchant because he's insulting. He Insults people. He sends emails to people. When he reads them wrongly. Yeah. He'll bring up a period of your life you don't want to talk about. Yes, get the little short fat one. He's. He's a lot more polite. Sure. Leave out the lanky one. Yeah, yeah. They probably wouldn't say lanky, Rick. They don't know what I look like because they listen to me on the radio. I think they're insulting. They might say, oh, you know, west country oink or something. But who was it I was listening to yesterday? There was. Someone had a. A Bristol accent. Fascinating. In and. No, but. No, I think. Oh, yeah, it was one of those. The Fame Academy. Disappointed, but I think you'll have to get into it. Bit of a sham at the moment, but I mean, no, there's no investment. I didn't know them and one of them had a Bristol accent and I just thought it really is a stupid accent. What we got lined up, Claire? What have we got? A bit of John Spencer blue. Oh, I love this. I love this. This is an old classic I brought in today and I think you'll enjoy it. Hello. Don't you start on that, Rick. There's so much I could attack you about. I mean, look at you, look at you. You're laughable. John Spencer Blues Explosion. Oh, you do it. Well, no, you know, I just thought I would. Yeah. On account of I brought it in. And then someone was complaining that we speak over each other. Yeah. We had an email saying we gabble too much and we. And we both went, I don't think we do. Yeah. Did you say that? I didn't hear you. I was talking at the time. Yeah, yeah. Right place, wrong time by John Spencer. Yeah, I. Yeah, we also had an email that. He didn't enjoy that. He didn't. We also had an email saying again. No, go on. I won't. I did this. Go on. Sorry. No, no, you. You can see why that would annoy me. I know you can see why that might annoy me. Take your headphones off then, cuz that's. It must be louder in your iPhones. Cuz I don't wear headphones. No, I'm not so much thinking of me as the people listening at home. Okay. The people who pay our wages. Go on in. We had an email that said, I don't know who's the victor in this, Rick. I don't know who's winning with you making that noise. What? You're the only person who's enjoying it. But if I Only do this for my. But there's a handful of people listening. Who's. Who's. Whose Saturdays, Rick, are empty. They've got nothing. They're running on empty and this is all they've got. Okay? And they. They want conversation. What are you gonna say then? It depends if it's interesting or not. Well, let me say it before you make the joke. Okay, so, all right, what about this? If you don't like. If it's not interesting, then you make the noise. Okay. All right. Okay, so this is just. We had an email, right? It said, is Claire Sturgis drunk when she does the show? I swear to God. That was a real email. I've lost it though. But. So does that warrant the noise or. No, that's right. That's quite interesting. Yeah, quite interesting. No, she's not. No, she's not drunk. Machine. A bit coked up. That's not true. Yeah, it's not true. The old Charlie. No, not true at all. No, you don't. You don't do drugs, do you, Claire? You're not using drugs, are you? No. No, no. Yeah. You're clean now. I am now, yeah. How did that go for you? The detox? It is great. Mainly thanks to you two. At least you don't have to steal so much now to feed the habit. Yeah. Anyway, are there any drug addicts on this station? No. Not anymore. No. Because I bet there are. I mean, you don't have to name names, but what about initials? Are there any skag eggs? Any smack? Seriously, because I'm intrigued anymore. Can you tell me off air who's. Who's a good. I'll be happy to tell you there are some more. There were. Not anymore. What do you mean there weren't? Stop this. Are there any people who. No, they think that they've got it under control, but they haven't really. It is awesome. They go and they think that no one knows, but they've got no pupils. Yeah. And they just stare at you for ages and go, what? At the end of each sentence. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz there's a couple of drunkards. I know, but there's no. It's boring now, okay? Play record. It's boring. Ricky J. Is telling us it's boring. Queens of the Stone Age there. No one knows. It's going well. Yeah, yeah. Adverts or what? What do you reckon? Getting away with it from electronic, of course. Fantastic tune. Yeah. No, it's a mutual favorite. We. We both like that, don't we, Steve? We do indeed. Yes, we are mutually appreciative of that track, of course. Friend of the stars, Claire Sturges is here. My name is Steve Merchant. Ahoy, XFM 104.9. So I saw you the other day because I haven't seen you this week, but I did see you walking down the street holding a gum shield that you just bought. Fault. How'd that work out for you, The. The boxing? Oh, it was really good. Because we talked about. Are you aware of this, Claire, that he wants to become a boxer? This is something that Ricky talked about the other week on the. On the air. He suddenly decided at the age of 40 something that boxing is really 40 something means 47. I'm just 41. Okay. I am 40 something. But 40 summer is like a euphemism for nearer 50. Yeah. So don't say 40 something. Okay? Say 30 something. Yeah. So, yeah, he's taking up. But apparently there's something called white collar boxing. Did we mention this last week? No, you didn't. No, but I didn't know something about. I think you've mentioned it. Yeah, last week. Yeah. It's basically. It's like a kind of. It's like a classier version of Fight Club. The film Fight Club. Have you ever seen that? So instead of. They don't meet in sort of dingy sellers, they meet in, what, office blocks. And it's usually for charity at the Grosvenor or something, or a big hotel, I don't know. And you just have like a bill on there and. And you. You punch each other. Yeah. But anyway, I've been training. I've been training boxing for. For a while now, just like, you know, the pads and everything. And last week we started on sparring and it is a different level, honestly. I mean, I can work out now for an hour on the pads. And I did about one and a half rounds and it was like I was asthmatic. Because you're also the trainer, who is a boxer himself. Put the gunshot. And he goes, okay, I'm not gonna. And I was giggling with fear. I was giggling with fear. And he said, you've got to get a gum shield in case. And that's where he saw me. I'd gone to the Lonsdale shop and I got a gum shield. I just, I. I said this before, Claire, is that I just don't think it's a good idea. I mean, you know Ricky, you've known him for a while. He's not. He's not mentally tough, which is a problem. I think you're not. He's not sort of psychologically he's quite. He's quite weak. Like, he's scared of a lot of things, you know, cars. I mean, he'll get. I've seen, like, edgy, like if a car blows its horn and he's in the house, what's that? Is it coming through the door, is it? No, it's all right, Rick. We're on the eighth floor and it's across town. It's fine. I don't like crossing roads. No, he can't. I mean, I've never seen a man. So tight on the motorway. If someone's going the motorway, I'm looking at the speedo and if it's like 86, 76, I'm going, well, you know, just let's go in the slow lane. And I'm looking, my eyes like saucers, just taking all the information. Yeah, yeah. Because he can't drive. It's a rational fear, though, isn't it? But I think it's because you can't drive. Yeah. So, for instance, the fact that you, you know, I' I mean, because I. Can'T drive and I do exactly the same thing. That's all right. Yeah. But do you. But do you do this, Claire, which is when you're in the back of a cab and you feel the cab's going too fast, despite the fact that you say driving up Shaftesbury Avenue in rush hour. Yeah. So you're never going to pick up a great deal of speed. But Ricky will. He won't mention it to the driver. I thought, you're going a bit too fast. He'll whisper it to me. He's basically suggesting to me that I should. I should say something because I. Ricky DRIES off the telly. I don't want to cause a fuss. You better do it, Steve, because you're nobody. Basically, what he's insinuating. So I've always got to sort of make the complaint or I've got, you know. But you're terrified of. Yeah, you're terrified of. Of that. You're terrified of spiders, as we know. Yeah. Cobwebs. There's no smoke without fire. Yeah, I know who made those webs, Steve, and they live there. Yeah. It was you that got the certificate, wasn't it? Raised on the Spider man film so they couldn't show the trailer before, you know, you'd gone to bed. Are you scared of Spider Man? Does he tell you, no, I'm not scared of Spiderman. No, I'm not scared of anything. But I got. I quite used to the. You know, when I'm a celebrity. Get me out of here. That one that kept walking off the street. I got used to him. I got to know him. Yeah, he was all right. Yeah, yeah, it was all right. So you're too scared of that. Aren't as scary as the bath ones. Tarantulas are sort of like more furry. But what about these? Because, you know, these programs where they have. They'll have people on and they'll kind of. They'll. They'll sort of like. I saw a show once where it was about phobias. And a woman was terrified of dogs. And a psychologist kind of got her to spend some time with the dog. And slowly. You've got no urge to sort of try and have that. That therapy done. And so you can maybe deal with your. Your. Which is basically, let's be honest, a woman's concern. It's a woman's fear, isn't it? Essentially, I stand on a chair. Exactly. Exactly. No, but I saw one. What's that one? He's really nice. He's not Jerry Springer. He's really nice and he has, you know, weird people on it. What is it? Montel Williams? No. Montel Jordan. No. About 50. Yeah. Yeah. Is it. He's the one without glasses. Any. Yeah. Who cares? You saw Morris. Yeah. And there was like these women on there, right. And that, you know, sort of, you know, trailer trash. And they're going to scare the snakes, aren't you? And then a woman got a snake, and she'd be screaming, knocking things over. Over and. Okay, well, that's not doing anyone any good. That's just for the audience to prove her point that she's terrified. And it was like, tinfoil. And someone brought on millions of bags of tinfoil. And she was screaming. Scared of tinfoil. Yeah. That's worse, isn't it? Scared of tinfoil is pretty mad. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's irrational. I know somebody who's afraid of buttons. Yeah. Anything afraid of buttons? Weird going on in your head? In it. It's some sort of weird symbolism. I understand. The snake. The snake one or the spider one? Because I understand, you know, there are poisonous spiders and snakes. Memory. That could be, you know, but it's usually summer, you know. But how do you. Because I don't know. I. That's. Yeah. Because I don't have any irrational fears, particularly. Yeah. Except when you're flatulent. That I'm terrified of. Because you never know when he's going to spring because he's not got any of the social graces, Ricky, he'll just think it's funny to just pass wind, you know, dinner. I don't imagine he did it during dinner with Bowie, but if I'm having lunch with him, oh, it's because he'll just start grinning and you know, it's on the. You know, it's on the wake. Claire. You know, there's something in the post when Ricky starts just in a little kind of when his lips curl up. You're having lunch, maybe. Here it comes. Here it comes. And it is. I'll tell you, it is eye watering stuff. I mean, it's intense. Oh, tell that story. When you're on the. The train, there is. There is only one smell that is worse than Ricky Gervais. Flatulence. I was on a train once and a dog was on. A guy was on there with his dog and the dog passed wind, right? I don't know what he'd been feeding it, like sheep or something, you know, cattle. He must have been feeding it some. You know what I mean? Like intestines or something. It was intense. This smell pervades the carriage, you know, because they're all like, they're all kind of air conditioned or they're tight, so there's nowhere for the smell to escape. So it's just. It's just kind of spreading, like in this kind of invisible sort of stench that fills up the carriage. I tell you, people's eyes were bleeding. Do you know what I mean? It was like, that's how. But it was just. It was unbelievable. I felt like my face was melting. Like that bit at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. That was how it felt, right? And the bloke who was obviously a bit embarrassed said, oh, oh, I don't know. Sometimes I don't know who's worse, you know, with their flatulence, you know, people or dogs. And I wanted to go, I've got an idea. How about dogs? What about your dog? It was unbelievable. But it's that. Let's try and make a joke of it. No, get off the train at the next stop. It was just, I mean. Oh. I mean, I don't like people with dogs anyway. Just generally, you know, you'll see people walking. No, Rick. When you see people walking down the road with dogs and they just let a dog, you know, do its ones or its twos on the side of the road and then they just walk on. I just don't know what that is, but it is right and it really winds me up because you'll see people. It'll be like old ladies or kind of toffs or something like that. And they were the sort of people that will complain about, you know, bad language on TV or youths, you know, or ne'er do wells hanging out by bus shelters. Yeah. But as soon. But they're happy for their dogs to, you know, go crapping on the sidewalk. They anger me. People with dogs who just are irresponsible like that. That's the idea with liking dogs, is it? That again, that. That's arrogance of people. They think. But there are a lot of people, as I say, who are kind of. You know what I mean, who think they're better than. They don't have to worry. They have to bend down and scoop it up, which is what they should do. Yeah. Anyway. Well, that's my chest. Yeah. Play a record. You two. Electrical storm. They've done it again. I thought, that is beautiful, that track. I know you used to disrespect you. I just didn't like them for 10 years. And then all that you can't leave behind came out and I. I sort of thought, well, I could have been wrong. And that's brilliant. Rick, you know, earlier I mentioned you Prince, and we asked the question, is Prince a genius or not? We've had a lot of response, mainly above by email. Interesting. Rick. Some people think he is and some people think he is, isn't. Oh, yes. Well, this. This debate array. John, can we have some adverts? Well, in the last half hour, Steve, they've heard. They've heard Nirvana, they've heard Oasis, they've heard Great. They've heard Dylan. We've got. Coming up, we've got Cat Stevens, we've got Tom Waits, you know, Clean now. It's great music. We're playing a lot of music and talking less in the last bit. Now, some people, right, would say that's because we running on empty and we ran out of things to say at 20 past the first hour. Yeah. I say we want to get in some great tracks. Well, that's my excuse as well. What's next? Cat Stevens off Tea for the Tiller Man? I've got nothing. Steve, you're running. I know. Well, it's the noise. I think the noise was at the lowest point. Is it the noise? The noise was really miles from nowhere. Guess I'll take my time to reach that. Cat Stevens from Teeth the Tiller Man. So many people, Rick, haven't even got a Cat Stevens record in their Collection. And you hear tunes like that, you. You just think, why? You think why? I think why, Rick? So we just said. We just had someone phoned up saying they want a bit of Psychedelic Affairs. And Claire said, what's your favorite track? And we both went, it'd be Pretty in Pink. And it was. But you know, you know, you meant to say, like, like on High, Heart or Magic, you're told to say. Coming up, a classic by so and so. And people stay watch in case it's their favorite. And if it's not, you don't give that away. But it doesn't work when it's things like. I hear things all the time. Like. And after this, a classic from Men at Work. That'd be down under then. Yeah. Coming up next, a beautiful tune by Danny Wilson, Mary's Prayer. It's Mary's Prayer. It can only be Mary's Prayer. Yeah. So it doesn't work with. They've had one hit. Yeah. Or a tune from Hearsay. Oh, I hate them all. Nice. Like rock and roll. Don't kick them when they're down. Yeah, it's true enough. What other pop do we hate? You know that thing. Yeah, we all hate pop music, don't we? That's why we're alternative stations. I hate it. Russ. ABBA atmosphere. There's no atmosphere in here with that playing. Oh, last night thing started the Fame Academy for me and I. I've been. I'm quite a sad tele watcher and I've been looking forward to that for about two weeks. I fell for the hype. I can't believe it. I love Pop Idol. I love Pop Stars, the Rival. I love Celebrity Fit Club. I love all those things. Right. But just disappointing because they'd already picked them. I think it's. It's investment and I'll be honest, I think the standard was poor. The standard was poor. I think. So now, are these people with different abilities or is it all singing? It's. It's still singing. It's. It's rather like, like, it's rather like they've got us down to the last 12 of Pop Idol. Say it's like that. You come in at that level. But. But to be fair to the program, I think it's all about what happens next because, like now they get voted out like Big Brother. Right. And do they. Do they write their own material and stuff or. They'll be taught to do that. They've got the whole team together and everything. So then they're filmed, you know, like with the 24 hours a day and everything. And so I think you've got to get into it and get to know these people. There's always a few. There's already a few. I go, right, she's annoying. Yeah. Right, vote her out. And they have to. There's three that the teachers say each week, okay, you're up on probation and then you vote them out. And it gets it down to one person. But the interesting thing is it's not just they get a record and they release a single, they live the life for a year, right? So they get this beautiful sort of pad in Notting Hill Gate, they get a sports car, right, and it says they get to go to parties. They're already set up to go to the FA cup final, the Brits and all those things. Yeah. Meet all these people. And then after a year, it's taken away from him. Wow. They just take everything back. And you don't like this because you feel it cheapens. Like your celebrity lifestyle, which you've worked for. No, but. But the other thing is, of course, they could be big stars by then and they just have to get their own car. But out there, what. That psychologically is going to be grim. But are we gonna follow it up for that year? Are we gonna. Is it like. Well, that's when it becomes interesting. I mean, now, camera crews following hearsay. Now that's interesting. Yeah, I know. And that's when they actually. Yeah, yeah, but I don't know how they're gonn do it, do you? How long? Jane. Jane? Why do I call you Jane? There's so many. The name Jane's been mentioned so many times. You can call me whatever you like, Steve, love. Well, how long do you reckon Ricky would last in the Big Brother house if he was in Celebrity Big Brother? How long would Ricky stay in there? Well, you see, as a. Well, it depends. You see. Go on, you answer. No, because as someone who would be watching Big Brother, if Ricky was in there, I would make sure that he stayed in right till the end. Just for course. Well, of course, because, you know, he's irritating. He's a sort of. So I'm Chris Eubank. You're the Chris Eubank of the house. But obviously a lot of people tend to vote out the most irritating, annoying, most loathsome person. Well, they want to get rid of me. But the public, presumably, might want me in there. I think the public would turn against you as well. I know you, Rick. They would expose you for the charlatan you are. We haven't played a song for the ladies for some weeks because I just keep forgetting to bring one in. Need one. I need one. Thank you, Jane. I. I thought, you know, I played Tom Waits for a while, and this is, you know, one of his classics, and it's just beautiful, beautiful tune. And however many times you've heard it, it's still brilliant. Downtown Train wreck. Oh, I can't believe it. We're back next week. And Carl. Hopefully, he's back. Carl, I think will be. Yeah, well, we don't know, but let's hope everything's okay. I'm sure it is. And we'll see him next week. Thanks, J. Bye, everybody.",
