Weeks and some great records, Steve, from the last two weeks. That's true enough. Yeah. We're not actually here today. What are you up to today, Rick? It's eight hours earlier. So this is about 2:00, probably. So it's about 6:00 in the morning. I'm still in bed, mate. I'm asleep in me hotel room now. Where are you? We're in la. Los Angeles. Yeah. City of Angels. Yeah, yeah. City of Angels, Yeah. And so that's what we do. We're doing stuff like that. That's why we're not here. We're not here next week either. So next week is the best of this week. What? Someone's left one of those little things in here. It's brilliant. Is it? It's amazing. What are they called, those things? I just imagine, just thinking of being in the front row at Morrissey concert and going, oh, just. Can I just play along? They are brilliant. I don't know what kind of sign that is. I don't know. It's only used for when Kenneth Williams sees someone undressing. Yeah. That's the only time that is used. That noise, it's like it was specially created for the Carry on films. Yeah. We need. I don't know what it is, but we need something. When I walk in and see someone changing. Well, what about this? There is a light that never goes out by the Smiths. I phoned Carl up in the week. Yeah. And I said, what are you doing? He went, well, even though it's one of my days off, I'm just doing some research on the web. When found, I think I said, yeah, I'm doing science. And then he said, you can get wigs for dogs in Tokyo. That's his scientific fact. And I went, what do you mean dogs? If they need a wig? I said, if they need a wig, what? Dogs going bald? And he went like, this is fine to him. He went, it's a stressful city, Tokyo. The world's all right with Carl. He's always got an explanation. I've only ever seen him confused once, when in Edinburgh, he looked out of his window one day and he saw a bloke putting a parking ticket on some rubbish. Yeah. And that genuinely confused him. Yeah. It couldn't work out, could you? It's a bit weird in it. And the woman breastfeeding her eight year old child. You didn't like, did you? I don't like that. But the. What's the name? Animals with Wigs. I kind of thought, after I put the phone down to you, I kind of thought about it. I thought, yeah, it was a bit daft that he's. Sure he's not the aging pop group. No, the animals. But when you think. Have you ever seen like a bald pet? No. It's weird. What do you mean? Because my mum, we had a cat. We used to get through loads of cats because we lived. Oh, God. It started early today, isn't it? What do you mean? We're only a restaurant. We lived. Oh, God. What do you mean? No, we lived on like a main road. Oh, yeah. So we used to get through a lot of them. You know, stop wasting money. You know, it's not. Stop wasting money. You're not wasting cats. Right. So anyway, we had this cat that was ill all the time and it's just. Bag of news, probably. Yeah. Malingra. Yeah. I'm terrified. I'm going to Witch House. Oh, God. Bloody hell. Wrong. Don't let me go to the Pilkington. For some reason it kept being sick all the time. Yeah, that is news. That's definitely news. So my mum thought, kind of thought, I've had enough of this. And she shaved it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Now, I know you're not vets in your family, but what correlation did your mum think there was between it being sick and shaving it? Because it kept being sick and it was a pain to wash because it kept getting. So she wanted a dry wipe cat. So why didn't she just varnish it? What? It's weird. It's weird though. So now he's cold and sick. No, but, no, not. I mean, not all of it. She left sort of the back half, but sort of from. From its waist, sort of. I love that. Shave it because it's sick on itself. It was the weirdest looking thing. I mean, normally I like cats. I'm always like giving yours a str. The head and that. Yeah. As soon as she did that it was like, oh, yeah. And then. So now it's sick. Cold and hated. Yeah. I love. I. Carl. It must have. I mean, the other cats must have been taking the mick out of it constantly. You're just making things worse. Did it get. I'm hoping that it got run over and was put out of its misery. No, I think it. I think it got all right, that one. Or is that The. Yeah, it did get run over. Oh, God. Oh. Oh, dear. How many cats do you say you've got through? I'd say when? Whilst I was living at home. I mean, it's still on the increase even though I'm not there. So whilst. Whilst I was there. Probably five. God. Oh. And were you upset each time or you just got used to it? It's one of them things in it. Like I've said before, when you first see something, it's a bit of a shock. Do you know what I mean? It's like the Elephant man or whatever. Yeah. First time you see him, it's that sort of. Oh, look at that. Do you remember the first time you saw Steve? No, I'm not being funny. Do you remember the first? Yeah, but I've said this before. It's always then you get used to how people look and you don't. No, no. I'm gonna burst. You have to play a record. No, but he seems f. No, but I've got used to it. Shut up. Shut up. Let you down. Gold rush on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Brilliant. Well, here we are again. XFM on a Saturday. Just gone 1:00, Steve, if I'm very much mistaken, but we're not here as such. We're away again, gallivanting around. We got to do the special sort of best of again. Okay. Which we did a few weeks ago. So this is the best of the last three weeks, which I think is. I mean, I think it's the best three weeks we ever had. But I'd like it condensed into two hours. Yeah, yeah. Some great music as well in there. Yeah. There'd be some great music interspersed with. With fine chat that you've already heard. Yeah. Except this bit. This bit's new. We've actually, out of the kindness of our heart, we've come in. We've come in last week. Yep, yep. And we've done a few clips just because we felt a bit guilty about shooting off. I mean, even now, having heard this link, I'm beginning to wonder if it was worth our time. Yeah. Well, should we play a classic link? Let's play what from the last three weeks after this. This is feed. Yeah, yeah. It's just the way I'm feeling. Well, if you've just tuned in, it's XFM 104.9. You've got that bit right. Ricky Gervais. Shoe with me, Stephen Merchant. Hello there. Carl is actually in a little booth we're not in the studio, see, we're. This is pre recorded. We recorded this last week because we're away and it's sort of like the Best of, Best of the last three weeks since last time we were away. When we put out the Best of. It'S a long time since we've had any white van, Carl. For those that don't remember this particular hot feature, we basically asks Carl some of the questions that are asked of a white van driver in the sun. They always have this on Saturday afternoons. Anyway, here's the first one. They're not fascinating, Carl, but I'm just interested on your take. Really? Yeah. What do you make of Cilla Black quitting blind date after her husband sent a message from beyond the grave? Are you familiar with this story? She went to see a medium and supposedly her husband passed on information through the medium, which was incredibly vague, but persuaded her to quit live on air. Well, so that is about time, isn't it? If even dead people are saying enough's enough. I tell you what, though, genius, talking about ghosts and that, do you know how I'm into them? Yeah, right. How weird do you think this is? Right, well, it's not true. Before you say it, play a record. No, go on, go on, go on. Right. It's this woman. I don't even know if it's ghost, really. It's just a bit weird. Yeah, sure. There's this woman and she's. Well, she's not a woman, she's a kid. Sure, okay. She's walking down like a street in her area. It's a nice day and everything, Everything's normal. She's walking down and a woman comes up cycling past, right? The woman on the bike looks at the kid, absolutely terrified, right? Got a really scary face on her. Yeah. The kid's thinking, why is she doing that? Yeah. Right. So anyway, she thinks nothing, nothing of it. Goes. You know, I think she was playing in the park or whatever. Goes. And has a nice day about 15 years later. All right. Yeah, She's. I don't know, I think she was going to work, right? On a bike. She's riding her own bike. Riding her own bike, cycling down the road. Oh, yeah, Looks at the kid. That's the thing that happened like 15, 20 years ago, right? It's her on the bike, looking at. Her as a kid, right? Not. Not another child. No. So it's her. She's seen herself. What, Carl? I mean, I don't know where to start. Firstly, where's this information come from? But I mean, what. Why do you ever. I mean, I don't know what part of that you think can be true. I don't. I. I'm honest, I'm. I'm speechless. I don't know what to say. What are you talking about? Bit weird though, isn't it? But it's not true. It didn't happen. Nothing happened like that. She said it did. Well, she's wrong. She said she saw herself. She saw herself as a kid, didn't she? Did she? And as an adult, when she was. A kid, did she stop and talk to herself or did she ride on by and think, that's a bit weird. There's me as an 8 year old. I won't stop. I'll be late for work. Yeah, yeah. If I'm late again, the boss said he'd be in trouble. Oh, and where is this information? Was it. Did it happen to someone you know? No. You overheard it on the bus? No. It was in the. 14 times. All right. That's the answer to the bottom of that. Right, Good. Carl, let me ask you. Now, Carl, you will be a little bit unnerved about this. Have you seen the film Jurassic Park? Yeah. You know what happened there? Well, according to the sun here, it says scientists are planning to clone mammoths for a theme park. Look at his face. Look at that. He looks like a dog caught in the headlights of a car. He's terrified. I love Carl. He sprung to attention there. Is that the best news you could have? Man moths. Right? Yeah, man moths. I hate the fact that that's why. He was so excited that they bred a man moth. What is this? Yeah, it's a human being that hides in your wardrobe and eats the entire jacket in a day. Yeah. What do you mean man moths? Mammoths. Mammoth. The big hairy cow from the Ice age. I mean elephant. You're not so excited about that then. You can take or leave bringing back mammoths to life, but a man moth. A man moth is a different matter. If we'd have never brought that up, he'd have gone and told someone. Now you know they've bred an half man, half moth and that's how things start. Are you slightly deaf? Is that it? When you hear these stories? Is it, Col, Is English your first language? Are you actually foreign? Is that thing. Yeah. Should we say. When we say foreign, we mean not of this planet. Yeah. Should we speak? So would that be a help to you? No, go on. What do you make of it? To bring back prehistoric elements, These giant elephants, they're Slow, aren't they? It's not as if they're gonna, like, get out and run fast and they can't capture them. They'd probably be fair, to be honest, Carl. They'd probably be offended. But they're. But you're asking it as if, like, oh, it could all go wrong. But it couldn't, could it? Well, but the point was about Jurassic park because they thought it wouldn't go wrong. They thought they had it all under control. That thing from Jurassic Park, Carl, Dinosaurs. Would say, oh, think about it before you do it. But with a hairy elephant, it's not gonna. Lot of concern for you. Would you go along to see him? Would you be interested in that? If it was in the area. He's great, isn't he? I'd love. I'd love a queue. Impresses me. No, but what I'd like to do is Carl sitting like Yoda in a little cave. And I'd just like to see people like Tony Blair and, you know, Stephen Hawkins in a queue and they go and say, carl, got a bit of a problem and thinking of cloning a. Man and a moth. Not an issue. No. If I'm in the area, I might cruise around and have a look at it. Otherwise, just don't send it near my clothes. Oh, that's fantastic. So just for a second, as the words man moth came into your head, how excited were you? I mean, were you both terrified and excited for. Just for the moment when you thought that they cloned a man and a moth? I pictured. What kind of face did he have? Did he have the moth's head or was it a man's head? Just a little head. Little man head. Right. What. What was his face? What did it look like? Just. He just was like a bit, like perplexed. Ye. Yeah, like so. It was like he'd been. He'd been. He'd been grafted onto the body of a moth when he was asleep. Yeah, he'd woken up. He just. He just went in for a goiter removed and they said, we've replaced your goiter with the body of a giant moth. Yeah, just that. All right, Mr. Jenkins. So he had the head of a little. Was it a little boy or a man? Little man. Right, okay. And he's just bumping into a lamp. If you went into hospital and they've done something, what's the worst thing I could do? Right. What would you rather have done? You wake up and you've got lobster claws for hands. You wake up and you've got Ducks feet or you wake up and you've got one horn coming out of your head. The worst thing. Yeah, probably the, the horn coming out of my head. Why get in the way? That'd be useful, wouldn't it? In fights and stuff and for like parties people. The lobster claws would also be quite handy there. Oh, that's a wonderful, wonderful clip. And yeah, great record that preceded or followed it, I'm not sure, but. Oh, could I make some dedications? Yeah, because I love. Last week, just before we had to come in to record this, I popped out trying to get onto the tube and I had a nightmare because there are loads, millions of protesters, so called protesters now, a lot of them obviously doing good work. There was one fella, I think you'd have appreciated it because I know you are very politically active and I think this guy has really studied hard and he's realized the best way to make his voice heard on the international political stage is to ride around on a tricycle wearing a jester's hat. He was really shaking up the blood. I wouldn't want to be Geor W Bush about now. Once he sees that, he sees that guy. Imagine his aides rushing in and going, george W. Look at this guy. Where is that? That's in London, England. Okay, call off the forces. Is that a large tricycle? Yeah. Is he wearing a nappy? Get me Colin, pal. Why'd you call him Colin? Not Colin. It is the way he likes it. Don't about. Just call off the troops. There's a. In the jester's hat. All the troops off. Just bleep some of those bits. Online at xfm.co.uk xfm.xfm 104.9 of a Saturday. Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant. Hello there. But we're not here. No, we're away. So this is the best of. And I hope you're enjoying it. We certainly are. I had some exciting news this week, Carl, you'll be pleased to find out. I'm worried that you might get a little bit jealous because it's obviously going to impact on your world quite strongly because I know you think you'd like things to be quite, you know, samey. You like the status quo to be maintained. You like the fact that in the past, you know, we've had some crosswords, you know, because you've. I remember. What did you think of me when I first walked in, when I first came in on the first day of exhibition? I don't know why you're making a big deal I'm just being honest, though. I'm just honest about a lot of people who see you for the first time sort of go, well, he's a bit weird. I know that, Steve, that you brought it up and then you're again. But I'm sure that wasn't what he said before. No. Yeah, well, it was a bit weird. Yeah. Well, he looked at you and I knew. I could see by the look of his face. You know, when, when you know your kid and your kid's sort of scared of someone, they go, why'd you get. Oh, he doesn't like pigeons or spiders. It was like that when I saw Carl and I brought you in and I went, what do you think of that, Carl? I could see, look at his face, that he was disturbed. Sure. And then as he said, you get used to it, don't you? Yeah, you get used to it. And you have changed a little bit. Your hair's a bit smarter now and you've got some nicer glasses and that, I think. Or I might just get used to it. Wow. Don't bring it up, Steve. Don't look at me like that. So you say that you think some other people in the office thought the same. Do you know that for sure? Did you discuss it, Carl? Yeah, I think they do, yeah. Okay, leave it there then. But not just in the office. As you walk through the building. Oh, it's worse than you ever thought. Well, no, it's not worse than I ever thought because as you walked, no Ricky delays. Yeah, what did I do on Thursday morning? Oh, is this the thing for those. That perhaps are not of the female persuasion? Listening. There's a magazine, apparently it sells quite well. It's one of the sort of female, you know, kind of issues magazines. I think it's called Company magazine. You know, it's like you're sort of. I guess it's a bit like your Moore or your Vanity Fair or whatever. Anyway, they run every year the 50 most eligible bachelors in Great Britain section. Ding dong. Hello, who's in there this year? In the. In the 50. In the top 50 of the entire country. And then they vote. They vote and they put them in order and see who's the most eligible bachelor. But that's off. That's 50 people, right? Most. I mean, the. I. It always annoys me slightly because bachelor, it. It kind of seems like a more sophisticated word for loser. Yeah. Which always sort of. And also they try and do a different 50 every year, so they're getting pretty desperate to get different ones. Because also a lot of people who are sort of like successful, you know, are married. So there's very little. Go on. There's a huge. I don't know if this is international. It could even be international. I'm not sure actually. So I could be up there with the likes of Justin Timberlake, etc. So Fred Durst. Yeah, that sort of person, you know. So anyway, this is what's exciting, right? Although I'm slightly frustrated because they were telling me that last year. All right, they gave. What happens is the readers of the magazine, they vote for who they think is number one most eligible bachelor. Right. Last year the. The prize was a two week trip in the Bahamas. Okay. This year I'm rather annoyed because all I'm gonna win is a moped. Whoa, oh, whoa. Backtrack. Sorry. Last year was a two week trip to Bahamas and this year just a mop. All I'm gonna get. All you're gonna win is a moped. Yeah. You've got no chance. You've got no chance. Who else is in it? Who else in it? Well, I mean, I don't know. Lots and lots of people you'd never heard of. There was. I know, Duncan from balloons, so. So you're second to him at least already I imagine you're. You're gonna come behind the other 49. So. Because there are people voting for me to vote for me. Yeah. Steve. They'll see my photo. Yeah. According to he, I was 22nd most sexy man in the world. I better take that helmet back. I would. ACDC. You shook me all night long on XFM 104.9. Well, this show is a rocking. It is. It is. Steve Merchant. Carl Pilkington, quick query for you. This is from Jay. He's got a problem here. He says my parents won't let me ditch my studies. He's currently reading modern languages at London London University. Sure, he wants to follow his dream, but his parents won't let him. Of being a dancer. Carl. Worse than that. He says that they're trying to arrange a marriage to a bunch of mingging daughters of people they know from good families. He doesn't know what to do. She's got the arranged marriage coming along and he's also got, you know, he basically wants to, you know, wants to be a dancer. His parents are forcing you into something more practical. First thing, right? I don't think the arranged marriage thing is such a bad idea. Okay. Because I think too many people go on looks, right? And then you soon get bored of that and you find out the person who you're knocking about with, it's actually not your type. Right. Why don't you arrange marriages for people? Well, I'm just saying. Right. So I'd say, jay, go along with that. I wouldn't worry about it. Okay. I mean, if they're really ugly, then, you know, don't go along with it. But if they're half bad. Yeah, put up with it. That's all. Right. The dancing. Brilliant, right? That's that solved. Brilliant. I want to be a dancer. After I did the boxing, right, I joined. Joined a dancing thing just near Man United's ground, right? Called Twiggies. Went along. I wanted to learn some moves. How old were you? Well, it was when Michael Jackson was like pretty big, so about 80, 83, 84, 85 around there. Wanted to do it. When I went, it was shut and had become like a warehouse for toilet rolls. So in a way, I wonder what would have happened. Sorry, sorry. How is that an anecdote about you going through dancing? You've told me before. You what? You did boxing for a while. You did dancing for a while. You had two fight in the boxing. You didn't even get in the. That's not enough. Imagine if that was a film. This is nice. A boy's dreams becoming a dancer. Oh, it's shut. Next on. I mean. Yeah. How is that? Yeah. Billy Elliot. Do you think? Yeah, Yeah. A brilliant Footloose. All right. Yeah. I'm fed up. They banned it. Let's go. Eyes shut. Flash dance first. There was. It's a warehouse. Never mind. Yeah. I'm just saying, you know, you'll find something else. I think I got a go kart. After that, I bought a motorized go kart and kept myself busy with that. So there's always this thing. Alan Bennett has to sit down and really sweat over his stories. Yeah. He just opens his mouth. You are a living Alan Bennett character. So that's. That's old. Well, Jay, don't worry about that. There's no emotional. There. Emotional problems I can foresee if you follow that advice. So the advice there is do an arranged marriage. If she's not. If she's not minging, she's not completely minging. Yeah. And don't worry about dancing. Get a go kart. Cheers. XFM 104.9. We're not here. This next clip is one of my favorite clips. Look, it needs no introduction. Here it is. What should we do next? What should we do next? Too much. We get. Do we need them? Out of the way. Yeah. Just. Let's explain it again if you're new. I'm sort of on a bit of a mission to find out, you know, we've got a lot of animals and insects in the world and stuff. Do we need them all? It still amuses me. So we found out we've got to keep jellyfish. We've done octopus. She said we've got to keep them this week. Snails. Do we need them? Just doing some research. Right. I'm sort of working my way through different creatures and insects and stuff that's on the planet. Yeah, right. And finding out if we need them or not. Right, yeah. Do you know much about snails? Sea snails? Well, yeah, snails in general. Don't know much about snails. Land snails. A little bit about sea snails, like whelks, top shells, that sort of thing. Would you say they're important? What sort of sense you mean by important? Say if we had to sort of get rid of some animals and insects and that, because we're running out of room. Do you know what I mean? Because. Because I'll tell you what, I know about some snails. I don't know if this applies to sea snails as well. I mean, I called you today because a lot of other places are shut. Yeah. Right. So I know they like to eat stamps. Apparently the glue on stamps, they love it. Right. Apparently a lot of letters and stuff aren't getting to where they're meant to be getting because snails are crawling into letterboxes and eating stamps. That obviously doesn't apply to the sea ones. But that. That's a problem they're causing. All right. Were you aware of that? No. But you're glad you answered the phone today. Right? They love beer. Beer, yeah. Who doesn't? And also, I don't know if this is right, but I heard that they sleep for 13 years or can do. Right. I wouldn't know if they can sleep for 13 years or not. But I mean, sea snails are pretty important. Yeah. They do quite a good job in the sea. They graze on algae, they provide food for other animals. I mean, you can say that about any fish, any animal. Why do they exist? Would you be upset if someone said we're getting rid of them? Oh, yeah, yeah. You would be. They're an animal, you know. I wouldn't forget being like favoritism and all that I get for them. Right. There'll be other things knocking around. You can sort of spend your time looking after. You'll still have a job. Don't be worrying about that. Because I'm not going to get rid of all the fish. Jellyfish need looking after, so you're safe. Yeah, but do we need them? Come on. There's loads of people saying, come on, we've got to move on through the animals. And you're holding them up, saying, well, I want to keep them. He's saying, we need to. That just sounds a bit. This sounds a bit crazy to me. Just. Just imagine, do you know what I mean? And they would come to you because you're working an aquarium. So they'd be asking for your advice. Right. And you're slowing it down. Well, they asked my advice and I'm giving it to them. So, you know, that's what I think anyway. Yeah, but snails, you know, I mean, like I say, they drink beer and that, you know, what do they do? Apart from some food for a whelk? They were. They were around, their descendants around a lot longer. Longer than we have been. Yeah, they've been around a long time, but what have they done? Well, they survived that long, so they must be doing something pretty good. Well, apparently they sleep for 13 years, so. Really? Even though they've been around for ages. That sounds a bit. I don't think I sleep for 13 years. No, I mean, not all of them. Just. Just the. Just the tired ones. So snails, do we need them? Well, yeah, I just think they've got a. Just as, you know, it's not for us to say, do we need them or not? We can't, so. So you think we should keep them? Yeah, definitely. Go, go, go. I'm proud of you. That was getting really quite annoying. I know. What did he think he was doing? What? I don't know what you tell these people. I mean, you don't get their permission to play this out, do you? You just don't tell. The thing is. Right, yeah, I sort of told him what it was about. But we won't say who he is or where he works because it doesn't matter. I just needed to speak to someone who knows. I know the fact that you were trying to get an answer out of him by suggesting that he would be safe because he could look after jellyfish if he gave the okay to destroy snails. You can tell. Oh, God. Brilliant. So you've been around a long time, but what have they done? Right. Last week, when I did, do we need them? Do you know when I called up one of the museums in a science museum? Yeah, he talked to me. Yeah. I'm just saying I wanted to tell you before, when the song was on, but you're so busy listening to it. Yeah. Oh, oh, was I so busy listening to a song I was playing? Yeah, but we're doing a radio show. All right, what's your point? Well, I just wanted to say she emailed him to say I got her name wrong. So I'm just apologizing for that. What did you call her? I think I called her Jessica. What was her name? I don't know. I've got an email somewhere. This is not an apology. You got it wrong again. You've not even said her real name. How is that an apology? Well, I remember I read the email, so, yeah. Who are you apology to apologizing to? I think her name's Jackie, I think. Oh, you've got it wrong again, haven't you? Well, well, anyway, and she just said if you, you know, if you want to see dinosaurs and that, go to the museum. You were complaining about that as well, weren't you? You went to a museum and there was too many dinosaurs. You just said. He said you just need four. No. Well, Steve, have you been to the one in Knightsbridge? I think this one that I called up, right. It's nice. You go in, you get a good collection of stuff. You walk in, there's three or four dinosaurs. You've had enough, right, go to. I went into New York, right, went to the museum there. Hundreds of them. You can't move for dinosaurs. It's almost like they're responsible for them being extinct. There's loads of them. So all I'm saying is if you want to see a dinosaur, go to the one near Knightsbridge. They've got a nice selection, some old vases and stuff. It's worth going. So that was great. Carl. Play record. Well done, me man. I'm obsessed with this song, Red vines. It's brilliant. Xfm 104.9. Ricky Gervais show with Steve Merchant. Hello there. And we're not here this week. We're off jetting around the world. So we've pre recorded these links. The time is currently somewhere between 1 and 3 o'clock. So a time check there from Steve Merchant. No problem. Yeah. And. Oh, what. What about this weather? Isn't it warm Stroke. Edit that, Carl. Cold. Okay. Whichever one. I'm pleased to see that the congestion charge has had some considerable effect. Had no effect. So just. Yeah, wasn't that great on telly last night, the film? Yeah. I particularly enjoyed last night's EastEnders, Coronation Street, Brookside. Okay. Yeah. Xfm. Xfm 104.9, Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Tell us about this monkey, Carl. You're gonna love this one, Steve. Right, yeah. So last week we were talking about how, like, a lad left his family because there was problems at home and that. He went and lived in the wood. He got airy. No, leave it there. We haven't got time to go into. That's what happened. And that's what happened. He lived with the monkeys. He went airy. That's what happened. Looked into some other stuff about, like, airy kids and all that. Came across this story about a bloke, right, who worked in a zoo. Oh, dear. Right. So trouble's brewing. Loving his job and that, but it's quite a lonely sort of job because you don't see many people. You're just dealing with animals all the time. Right. So anyway, he gets a bit pally with a monkey because it's the closest thing to a human. Well, that apes. Right. Yeah. But you can't really go that close to apes. What do you mean? What type was it? Just let him tell the story. Was it a chimpanzee? I reckon it was a chimp, yeah. Yeah. I don't even know. So that's an ape. Yeah, but it doesn't matter. So he gets Paddy with him. Right. So he gets pally with him. Have they gone holiday together? Well, no. I mean, it starts off. Starts off just checking each other out and, you know, probably sharing lunch and that together. Yeah. Right. Anyway, this goes on for a while is, you know, they're getting on well on that. And then after a while, right, the monkey starts sort of imitating him a bit more and sort of walking upright. Oh, God. Yeah. Right. So he thinks, oh, that's a bit weird. Anyway, they get on really better and what have you. So he thinks he could. He could live at home with me, this. Yeah, because we're getting on the storm. Yeah. Right. So he takes him home and before. The beginning of Beneath the Planet of the Apes, I think it is. I think you've seen this on video. I'm worried because he's already imitating when they're moving in together. I'm thinking it's maybe a bit like single white female. Single white zookeeper. Oh, brilliant. So anyway, so it's moving in and it's getting used to sort of the normal human life. He's having a cup of tea in the morning. Yeah. PG Tips. As a. As a. It finishes the day off with a. Finishes. Finishes the day off with what? It does now remove a piano at. One point, does it? It finishes the day off with a little branding. Yeah, he pours himself. Is he wearing a smoking jacket? Yeah. I'll tell you what, Carl, you're a man. No, this is. This is why it attracted me. It's amazing. Right? So he's having his brandy and that, loving his life. Next thing you know, he sort of. I don't know if he loses it or it gets shaved, but the top half of his body is hairless, Right. Apart from his head. Right. So he's got a nice. The opposite of the kid. Yeah, that would happen. Right, well, hang on. But. So you don't know if he's shaved or if. How did it say, then the. The hairless. What? What? I'll bring it in for you. The story. And then you. So anyway, so. So this is going on and he's having a great life. Then the zookeeper starts getting a bit annoyed because he's having a better life than the zookeeper. The zookeepers in the zoo. So the zookeeper's still got to do a day's work. The monkeys at home, he's partying. When he says there's no point you coming in to the zoo, because the whole reason of you being there was because you're being kept there, right? And he didn't want to bring the memories back, so he said, you stay at home. You are just. You're talking such. Just let him finish. God, I don't know if I can sit here and listen to this drivel. Let me. Oh, I'm fascinated. It's nearly over. It sounds extraordinary. So he's walking upright, he's having a tea in the morning, finishing the day off with brandy. Gets a bit out of hand. Only tries it on with the zookeeper's wife. Make him go away. How does he do that? Well, because he's around humans a lot, he becomes a bit of a charmer. But what is it that he could. Do to seduce her? Pick fleas out of her? He didn't say he's built. He was built. Yeah. He's well known. What about that? What do you mean, what about it, Carl? It's obviously not true. I don't understand how that. I love that he becomes a charmer. He's got better taste in brandy. Exactly. What was it that he was doing that seduced her? I don't know. Maybe because he was at home more than the zookeeper was. But what would he be doing, Carl? He's not gonna be talking with her. They're not gonna be playing Trivia Pursuit. Maybe. Maybe she liked the silent type. It didn't go into that. It just said that's when the trouble started. Is that what Suzanne did when she brought you in? Yeah, Talking to the Sunburst yesterday. Oasis and Songbird. It's a nice little ditty. It's all right. Yeah. Of a Saturday. Yes, thank you. Xfm 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. I. I think we should go straight into it, Carl. I think you should. We should do the competition that the. There's Carl in the corner. It seems a little premature. Do you reckon? Yeah, it's so good. We should. We should tease it out. Well, it's. It's a big. It's a big thing. It's just that I've got absolutely nothing to say. I've. Sure I haven't really. Well, I mean, like often. I know you all have spoken to Carl in the week. This week for some reason. I've been speaking to him all right. I spoke briefly to him about Michael Jackson and the documentary. Yeah. Now, of course, that. I thought that was extraordinary. Yeah. And he didn't mention to me the fact that Michael Jackson likes to climb up in trees. He didn't mention anything about his bizarre relationship with children. He didn't mention anything about his obsessive billionaire spending sprees. He didn't mention anything about the mannequins he has in his thing or the fact that he drives around his seven hotel suites in Las Vegas in a little kind of old people's scooter. The first, the only thing of note for Carl was he said to me, did you notice how big his hands are? I tell you what though, I did. How you look at. The man's got like a face that he's had reconstruct. Well, I can't even say that's libelous. Yeah. He's had two jobs. Yeah. And you're looking at his hands, but. I think it's because you look at him and he looks a bit like. There's a bit of androgyny there, but it's sort of like a. It is quite a petite sort of old lady's face in a way. But then you see these laborers hands come out. That's always the way with a tranny, you know. I mean, you can't accuse him of being a tranny. No, he's not. No, no, he's not. He's got enough issues. Now you're accusing him. I like him. I thought he came out that Brilliant. I thought he was really. I really felt sorry for him. And no, I think he cleared up a few things as far as I'm concerned. I thought it was a fascinating piece of work, but I did like the shopping spree. That was great pointing. I know, it was bad taste, wasn't it? It was like one of those bizarre shops. Yeah. I mean, there's anything sort of a gift shop, but they're trying to make it look like men. But if. Yeah, I mean, it's braid gold. If he'd been living in a trailer park, he'd have been ordering, you know, one of those porcelain dolls dressed like a Harley Davidson or, you know, an Elvis commemorative plate. It was the kind of billionaire equivalent of that. But the hands were a giveaway. It's the same as those sort of transvestites, you know, when you get like a cab driver or something, right? And he decides to turn transverse about 60. And he goes on, kill Roy, they've got a twin set of pearls. And he goes, I've never felt so comfortable. But his hands are still big. He's got a little wig and he's got the lipstick on. And he's with his teenage kids who are going, kill me. Do you think he's been having surgery on his hands to make them larger? Is that why he was wearing that glove for most of the year? Exactly. I think he wants to be a goalkeeper, right? And they said, you can't, Michael. You gotta have big hands. It would help him climb the trees. Yeah, yeah. And he can play tennis now without a racket. Yeah. What did you make of it, Carl? Were you intrigued, the Michael Jackson thing? Oh, you know, it was all right, but that got a load of attention in the press. But the Trisha program got nothing. Okay. Which I know, like, well, Steve called me up in the week, right? Like 10 o'clock in the morning, I was at work. And he goes, at 10 o'clock preparing this show. Most people go to work about eight or nine. Are you watching Trisha and that? I said, no, what is it? He goes, oh, you'll be loving it. Right, Freaks, was it? Help me, my mum's a freak. Siamese twins. So I couldn't watch it, but he said, oh, it might be on again because they Repeat stuff on ITV2. So I had me dinner late, right? Instead of having it at like 1:00 like I normally do, I had it at like 2:30, sat in the office, put the telly on ITV2. These Siamese twins, did it blow your mind it was amazing. You know, we talk about a lot of things on the show. Quite a lot. The airy kids crop up a lot. I was waiting. It's been 10 minutes and you haven't mentioned the airy kid. Right. And last week we were talking about Siamese twins, weren't we? So it was. It was weird that this program was on, but it was amazing. I mean, what. I think you can't refer to them as Siamese twins. I think they're known as conjoined twins. Why? I think. I think Siamese is maybe considered derogatory or it's an old antiquated phrase. Yeah. I think it's because the first famous ones were actually from Siam and that doesn't exist anymore. No, it's conjoined. Carl. Yeah. Get the phrase. Right. But you think that if that's happened to you, that wouldn't be that sort of offensive, the names that you must get called. Right. You think that's twins? I'd say. Well, that's. Yeah. Now, were you stunned by where they were connected? Just live with it, we'd say. Because they were connected, of course. At the forehead. Oh, sort of. Which was quite. Quite extraordinary. Well, there was one set of Siamese twins. One had a job and the other one didn't. That's ludicrous. Yeah. The other one was unemployed. The other one had a job. She had to go to work. She had to get up at 6 o'clock on a day off. I'm not supporting you. Literally. Yeah. Then they get done off the social for sort of. Yeah. Because everyone was signing on. That wasn't a question that Trisha asked, annoyingly, because I know that much of the audience was thinking that there's a. Few things that didn't crop up. What questions would you have asked of them? Because what things did you feel weren't mentioned? I'd love to just watch Carl watching amazing things. Exactly. Do you know what I mean? It's like. Like early learning. Mouth slightly open. Yeah. Mouth dribble. Looking around to see if anyone else has seen it. Like where the cat sees a bird land on the balcony. I can't believe it's luck. I'd probably say, how do you buy a. Like a birthday present? Surprise gift. Yeah. Because everything's ruined. Sure. I'd probably ask. Yeah. Well, did you not think it was interesting that one of them had a boyfriend? Well, that was a bit weird, wasn't it? But what was the other thing that I was thinking when I was watching? It was thinking if one got into Crime. And that was sent to prison. Right? What would happen? How did he handle that? It's brilliant. It is brilliant. If a chimp could talk. And what was the other one? The other thing was, what do they talk about? Because it's not as if you can say, oh, well, guess what I did today? Do you know what I mean? Yeah. But if you've just tuned in, it's XFM 104.9. You've got that bit right. Ricky Gervais Shoe with me, Steven Merchant. Hello there. Carl is actually in a little booth. We're not in the studio, you see, we're. This is pre recorded. We recorded this last week because we're away and it's sort of like the best of. Best of the last three weeks since last time we were away. When we put out, the Best of Me and Carl went out, right? And with me and Jane and Carl, Johnny and Gigi. Wasn't it? Is it important? No. Okay. But we're walking down the street. Carl was there, though, and he can back me up on this. We had a curry, we're walking back and this little funny homeless fella, didn't he? Yeah. Oh, I gotta tell it before I go, didn't he? Yes. He came up to me, right, and he recognized it and he came to me and he went. He went, oh, he said, I've just nicked five your DVDs from HMB. And he shook my hand, he was so happy with it. And I went. Went, right, excellent. He went, all I do is I just swing the bag over the top like that when I'm going out. And he had a bag full of DVDs, didn't he? And he was. He was so pleased to tell me that he'd stolen that. Great. He said that. He said, they're going like hotcakes. Of course they are. I know. We get paid for them, though, don't we? So. We. Not the stolen ones, don't we? No. What do you mean? Did you sign them for him, you idiot? He just nicked five. Yeah. You say he was homeless. Was he? Well, I. I don't know. Maybe. No, surely I would have seen the show. He just walked past Curry's one morning. Yeah. Yeah. Seen a trainer for it, thought. Interesting. I don't know if he was aimless. I did. I didn't go into his home life. He shook his hand, though, and. But he's. He made Carl look smart. Do you know what I mean? So how does he sell them? Where does he sell them? Does he go to people Go. Do you want an office dvd? They're not nicked. Yeah, four quid. Yeah, exactly. At least stolen new. No, no, no, no, no, no. They've still got the tags on them. Well, it's like those people who. You're. Those cab drivers that you'll meet. It's at three in the morning. Who just got a car. Yeah. Just went out with a car. Yeah. And I'll pick people up and charge them. Yeah. I got in one once. I said to him, a guy just pulled up. I said. He said, I was in, like, East London. I go back to North London. I said, yeah, going to Swiss Cottage. He went, sure. We set off. He went, do you know the way? I said, well, not really, no. I thought. I thought you'd know the way. You're in a cabin. He went, oh, don't really know the way there. I said, have you got an A to Z? He went, no. I thought, well, if you're going to go out just on the. You know, just winging it as a cab driver, two things. Take a map and a torch. He didn't have either. He said, well, I'll probably get to Camden. I said, well, I'll direct you from there. Drove on for about five minutes, making conversation. About five minutes later, he went, do you know the way to Camden? I thought you knew the way to Camden. I don't really know the way. I thought, oh, let me out. Four quid. Exactly. And that's. I can't. I don't know who's got that sort of time on their hands that they just think, it's three in the morning, I'm at a loose end. I think I'll go out doing a bit of cabbing. Wow. Because your dad was a cabbie, wasn't it? Yeah, he was, yeah. Couldn't stand it. But it's good money. He was a professor. He wasn't like a Chancellor. What was he. What was he doing when he put that little forest gump in a. In a weedy bin? That was. That was part of the cab company thing. They had to do like a charity event once a year, and he did it one year. Never asked him again. Tell the story again. No, I'd rather not. Because. Because we got a few sort of complaints about it. Why? Why do you get complaints about it? Because it's. Because he put a kid in a bin and it's not the thing to do. But we could use it as a sort of sobering lesson for people. Yeah. Tell it like it. Tell it like it, you know, Don't. You shouldn't do it. Nice. Yeah, but that's how I did it last time. But people still didn't like it. It. All the stuff I tell you, I don't. You know, we don't take the mickey out of people on purpose. It's real life in it and that goes on in life. Yeah. I was saying that in hospital, though. Do you know? I was in hospital? Yeah. You know, he did some jokes about old people and that and he said, at the end of the day, if something makes you laugh, it's funny. And if it makes you laugh, you can't help laughing, can you? So what you meant to do, nothing's good for you. Yeah. So. But the. Enough that isn't as good for you, is it? No, but there's probably more people laughing at one person. So if you balance it out, there's only one person who's upset and there's a bunch of people laughing. So it's. Give me an example of that. Give me an example, for instance, Carl. Pilkington as he talks and the people listening. Yeah, yeah. No, give me an example of like. So, you know. Well, I can't because again, that's what I'm saying. I can't tell you the story because there might be someone out there who. This person might even be listening and think I forgot about that. And you brought it all back to me. Yeah. So I prefer to leave it, but I think people know. Why did he put him in the bin in the first place? Because he was getting out of hand. What was he doing, though? You see, I can't explain. You can. That'd be silly. I prefer to. To leave it, honestly. What was he doing? Was he annoying him? He was annoying my dad and the other people in the cab. Right. And he thought, how can I deal with this before it gets too out of hand? Yeah. He pulled over and put the lad in a wheelie bin. So we'll. We'll leave that.",

I phoned Carl up in the week. Yeah. And I said, what are you doing? He went, well, even though it's one of my days off, I'm just doing some research on the web.
