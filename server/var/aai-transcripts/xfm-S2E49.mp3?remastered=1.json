  "text": "Kings of Leon, Molly's Chambers on XFM 104.9. Thanks to Lauren Laverne there for the last few hours. Coming up, we have got some great music, Steve. We've got Kings of Leon, you heard? We got Alba, we got the Darks, we've got Coldplay, Coral, Rolling Stones, we've got some Springsteen, the Smiths. Do you not mean you need any more? And with all that, we still got Pete Skinner with his wacky weather report. Excellent cold, Pete. Hey, nice to have him back. Good day. Steve. I've got some here brought in. It's just a normal soup. It's Rooster's Pride. What flavour soup's that, Steve? I noticed you brought that. And it's all a genuine. Genuine article. And it's soup. Oh, can I have a closer look at that? Maybe there's some more humor I can draw. You want a closer look at my. Just a cock soup? Let me just. It says here, Delicious, appetizing. Three to four servings. You know what I'm thinking of when you're talking about the soup? I'm thinking of when you went to. I think. No, I'm just thinking of a man's cock. Penises. Yeah. Let me just. In the darkness, use Rooster's Pride pop. Soup as a snack with crackers or toast. Still think of a normal nom. An appetizer again. Or a soup base that doesn't really wear it as an English. That's disappointing. We'll work on that, though. The darkness growing on me on XFM 104.9. Going well in it? I've enjoyed it so far. It's been a bit. Oh. Bit naughty and everything. Bit smart. Oh. Nothing wrong with that. No. Carl, having a good day? Not bad. Not bad, yeah. What mood are you in this week? What are you trying to assess each week? You know, I was a bit edgy. He's got a red head. What's all that? You've got a red head. All around the side, in the front. What's that? Sunburn? No, no, I think I'm. I'm allergic to having my head rubbed. Right. Now, who would rub your head? That sounds a bizarre thing. Your girlfriend. Weird, innit? Yeah. You rubbing your head? Well, yeah, but I was squeezing his head. Fair enough. And he was screaming in agony. And then he went and made me a cup of coffee and as he came over, just spilled boiling hot coffee on my legs. I'm not doing shorts. And he went, sorry, just like that. Just. It's not. It's like a series of jackass out there this morning. But I mean my legs are burned. Your head's a little bit red. But apart from that, having a good day? Not bad. I was on the way in today, right, Steve, Walking in, walking in, always walking in. I get left early and stuff. I like to get in early, get some bits done that monkey news, songs, a phrase, that sort of thing. And living in London, right. A lot of. There's a lot of shops that open early and stuff. Do you know what I mean? People say that's a good thing about London. Yeah. It's almost like 24 hour city and stuff. Right. I'm walking in and there's like, you know, you've got your news agents open, obviously, you know, selling newspapers and that. That's good. They've got to be open early. Then you've got your coffee shops, your Starbucks. She'll have a cup of coffee. Do you know what I mean? They're doing well in the morning then you see like the odd restaurant and you think, well maybe they sort of got the doors open but they're preparing for lunch. So you think, fair enough. Yeah, I'll let that pass. Yeah. Carrying on, walking down the road. Bondage shop open. Sure. Half past ten. Yeah. Busy, was it? There's a couple in some good offers. Half past ten for a bondage shop. I'm assuming if you're into bondage though you, you stock up at any time, day or night. I mean you don't. Yeah, well, I assume it. I suppose you get to go, oh, I've got nothing on. I need to be a bit. Oh, I need to be a bit tied down. Yeah. I need some rug. These clothes are too baggy. I need more belts, I need more straps. Yeah. Oh, get some rubber on my face. Weird, don't it? What are we doing in there? So I'm just having a browser. Oh. It's a bit worried really because the things that I've noticed this week like that that's probably a little bit smaller. You've brought your soup in. I just found it out there. Sorry. Yeah, it is Rooster's pride soup, noodle soup mix, chicken flavor. But I mean, do they not know that is obviously just going to be used on the Graham Norton show and Chris Tarrant when he's doing his show abroad. Yeah. I mean, do you know what I mean? How could they call it soup in this day and age? Don't keep saying it. Well, no, it's fine because. Yo cock. As long as it means the male. We've done this oh, do you mean. Do you mean the chicken? Yeah, look, it's a picture of a chicken. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What did you think it meant? No, I don't know. I thought it was my head. Okay. Sorry. Yeah. But, yeah, there's something else that's a bit. Sort of. A bit blue. A little bit blue, but then it's real as well. Do you know what I mean? Go on. There's a program. We couldn't have said the Cock Soup if we'd made it up, but because it's real. Yeah, yeah. We also couldn't say the cock soup if we'd have meant a male penis. Thankfully, we don't, so we mean a little chicken. Go on. Yeah, this program was on. It was Wednesday night. Something about this little lad who was a fella and a. And a woman at the same time. What do you mean? Like a cartoon with a secret identity. By night. By night. What do you mean? He had. By day a boy, by night a woman. He had it all. Sorry. So. So he had male and female genitalia. So what? What do you call someone that's born like that? Weird. Weird. Now, what's the term for it? Go on, you know it. We've talked about it before. Aphrodite. Nearly so close. Hermaphrodite. Yeah. Hermaphrodite. Yeah. Yeah. That's weird, don't it? Yeah. And he had. He had them all. Yeah. And he had the. Well, what happened was he was born, right, obviously. And. And the doctor said, there you go. Lovely little boy and girl. So the mom was like, what? So he said, no, I don't think. The doctor was sarcastic. Yeah, I don't think the doctor was sort of dissing them. There you go. What do you mean, Doctor? I will have a look. There's a mint. All right, see you later. What are you gonna call? Hit. But, Doctor, what do you mean? Have a look. He wasn't sarcastic. He didn't give clues. Tell me what you mean. Give me a straight answer. He probably went, oh, shit, she's got a cocktail. He didn't go. He wasn't. Saki to the parents. Anyway, I'm just getting across. I mean, I always had a little bit just. Yeah, I know. You should be a newsreader, be brilliant. So. So, yeah. So there's a little kid lying there. Yeah. And. And the. And the mum says, you know, what am I gonna do then? So the doctor. I mean, I'm condensing this. It was like, how long? Yeah, yeah. So he says, what will you know? She Said, what will I do? And the doctor said, well, he's not sort of well on. Right. Oh, so he's not sort of well on. This doctor has been, I assume, has been struck off since for saying these things. It was a real doctor, it wasn't Dr. Fox. Yeah. So the doctor said, so I recommend that we make it a woman. Right. So they sort of do a little bit of. A little bit of work. I don't think that's true, Carl. No, it is. It was on the program. But I think they can tell really what they were meant to be from the chromosomes. They can't. They can tell their xy. Yeah. Not just. It's not very well hung. No. I tell you what. Because back then when this was going on. Yeah. I'm just thinking they might not have had. The doctors then thought if you had a kid, Right. And you thought, it's a bit ugly, maybe it'll have a better life. If it was a. A fella. If it was a girl, it's a bit ugly. And you think it's going to get our time, Right. Don't talk shite. What? What, What? That a doctor would go, right, you've had. You've had a. You've had a young girl. I'll tell you what, she's a pig. Let's pop a on her. I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is say if you have a. Like I say, a girl. I just think it's harder if a girl's ugly and she's growing up. She has all the time. Yeah. Don't you agree with that? Yeah. You don't change their gender. What I'm saying is the Elephant man would have had a harder time if it was Elephant Woman, is what I'm saying. Listen to me. Listen, listen. What the doctor was saying is if you get a baby before it's two. Yeah. Back then they thought you could sort of say, well, give it. Instead of giving it a go. Kart, give it. Dolls to play with. Right. Back when. What are we talking about. The Middle Ages? We put a song on, come back. Yeah. It's Bruce Springsteen, Atlantic City. Bruce Springsteen, Atlantic City on XFM 104.9. Okay, look, have another go. Carl, what were you saying as an Amite? Yeah. It was born both sets. The doctor said he's not well on. Let's lose that. Let's get rid of that. Let's make it into a girl. Okay, I'm with you so far. Go on, then. So anyway, gets away with it a little Bit in the. In the early years. Right. Starts going to school or gets away with it a little bit. Sure. Right. But then do you know when you get to that age and your head goes all funny? Like when you. When you're a teenager and you. You sort of. I don't know, your skull goes. Mine never did. What are you talking about? Teenage years. When you look at it odd, you know what I mean, you go from being quite a good looking person and then your body starts growing at different rates. So you never know. You Never know till 21 whether you're gonna be a looker or not or whether it's just. Yeah, yeah, I know. Go on. Yeah, I'm still waiting. So your head grew outwards at exactly the same rate, didn't it? That's why it's. So your head grew faster than your hair. He's got a lovely head. Just, just below the skull. He's got a little afro in there, but it just couldn't get through the follicles. It couldn't catch up. The skull expanding. Oh, bless him. Oh, come on. Come on, baldy. But the thing is, right, so you see these pictures of the lad, stroke woman. Yeah. Who's trying to be a woman at the age of 14, 15. Yeah. She's got one of them big heads, right, Like a lady doesn't, you know, she starts having a hard time. She doesn't want to play with the mates with the dolls and all that. She's more into go karting and that sort of thing. Gets to an older age. Yeah. Decides to go back. He's now sort of with a woman and having a life of a fella. But did he have it? Did the doctor keep it for him in case he needed it? No, he's had his own one put. On though, as he. Where'd he get that from? No, no, Maybe that bandage shop. What do they do when they do that? Do they put on a. What do they do? Maybe someone could call in and tell us. If you're a woman and you have a. Do you want to speak to someone who's got that information? Yeah, I don't want to know what you've got information. I don't want to talk to you. Do they construct one? Do they construct it from Plasticine or. Do they whack on a dead one? What? What? Whack on a dead one? Yeah. What? What? That's nice. What do you mean? No, when a woman has a knob on. Yeah. To have a sex change, where do they get it from? Is it constructed they find like a donut from a donor. Oh, yeah, A donor. A donor, yeah. Yeah. But presumably it's like maybe there's someone who wants to date. I mean, no, it's not like giving someone a kidney and then sort of like celebrating. If you're a guy and you want to become a woman, you've got one to spare. That's true. Let's swap. Yeah, just do a little swap from. On the Internet or something. Oh, no, Edmonds, what do you mean on swap shop? He's not a man. No, no, but he'd go. We got a lovely feller here who got a lovely nearly new unused piece. Yeah. Keith, Cheggy and I kind of. Bognor Regis wants a couple of tits in the fanny for that. So call in. It reminds me of the. Do you remember the Jane, the John Wayne Bobbitt story, which always seemed odd to me. I never really kind of got all the information. Do you remember that one, Carl, where the woman cut off her husband's penis. Because he was sleeping? I think she drove off. I think he woke up quite. Yeah, yeah. That's so much better than the. Other than the local uncle. Yeah, yeah. And she threw it out. She threw it out of the car into the woods and he went and found it. Yeah. But imagine if he got to the hospital and so they turn it back on. He's gone. That's bigger than I remember. I'm not sure this is mine. How many of you? That's where we dump all the nuts. Yeah, that was an extraordinary story. And then bizarrely, he became a porn star. Yeah, yeah. Very strange life that man's had. Well, it is a bit of a shock to the system in it. Cutting your knob off. I know. Did you remember that French bloke, the performance artist about 1910? Do you remember him? No, no, As a performance art. He cut his. He had it in a theater. He cut his knob off to a crowd of people. Now what? Yeah, that's only a one night trick though. Exactly. But what if there had been a bang outside? He went, what? Yeah. Or they looked outside because a car backfired. Do you see that? Go. Office. Just cut that, did you? Yeah, Think of that. Sacra bleu. I know. French are funny, aren't they? Cr. Your knob off for. For your art. Weird. Is it? Long view further on. Xfm 104.9. As we're having so much fun with penises, I thought perhaps I should just mention. That's a slogan. We should just mention this story briefly. It's in the paper today, a Russian is selling what he claims is Hitler's mummified penis for £12,000. Ivan Zadooprov says his ex Red army soldier dad hacked it off as a souvenir after storming the tyrants Berlin bunker after his suicide in 1945. Yeah. Not why did he wait till now? Yeah. He's found out that. Yeah, that might. That might get a bit of £12,000. A great deal. It doesn't seem great to the money, really. Well, it's useless, isn't it? True. You're not gonna be able to use it. It's not gonna be able to. It's not gonna be a donor. Imagine that if you walk around. Yeah. You'll never. Making love to a girl. You'll never believe who this is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You never believe who's doing you, though. Exactly. This is gonna freak you out, this is. Yeah. Just relax. Okay? Sit down now. It was brilliant. It was brilliant. Yeah. So you enjoyed it? Yeah. Right. Are you a fan of the Third Reich? Well, no. Awful racist. Okay. Okay, let's go a different tack. Yeah. You did like the sex? I love the sex. Okay then. Yeah. It's not going to be Hitler's knob, is it? But I like the idea that. I mean, you're. You're a X Red. You're in the Red Army. Yeah. You've just stormed Berlin. Yeah. 1945, you crash into the. Gone through, you've gone through. How terrible. How you've lost 20 million comrades, oppression. Everything going on for years. You're in there, you see the man. Yeah. Here he is. He's dead. He's dead. He's the figurehead and leader of one of the most despicable. You know, you turn to your friends, there's a tear in your eye. Yeah. And your immediate thought is, I ought to chop off his todger. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. No, I said bagsy. I said bags. I said bagsy. Is Winkle outside, Whoever it was. Yeah. He knows to be Hitler. Brilliant. It's just. I can't. It just doesn't make sense. It's ludicrous. It's ludicrous and I don't know how. How is he expecting to prove this? Because I want some proof. Well, this. I think that's why he said that. He probably started off with, oh, I got Hitler's face. And they went, brilliant. Oh, let's have a look at it. What do you mean? We'll just check his face. Obviously I know what he looks like. Oh, yeah. No, it's not. Ah. Yeah, you know what? He. No, it's not his face. What? What? What? Wouldn't you know what it looked like? Well, I mean, no one's ever seen his genitals. That's what I've got. Yeah, I've got. I've got his. It's got a little swastik on it. Is that. How's that proof? Is it? Yeah. Have you got his ball? Well, no, the Albert Hall's got one, his mother's got the other, so I don't know. See, the Albert Hall, I would have thought would probably be that 12,000 men, because apparently they've. They've already got his bottle. Yeah, they've got one of his balls. They've got one of his balls. His mother's got the other. Yeah, but if they got the toddler. If they can retract down the one his mother's got, they would have a complete set of Hitlers. I'm just hoping it doesn't fall into the hands of some kind of crazed genetic scientist. What? I could clone it from his knot. Clone Hitler back to. Oh, I. I don't even want to think about the future. If that's the sort of way we're going. Exactly. If that's the sort of way we're going, Carl, I'd rather not know about it. What do you make of it, Carl? Weird, isn't it? It is weird. I mean, I don't want to go on for this too long. We've probably got about a minute left for the first half hour and I reckon should cam this sort of, what. 30 minutes of genital talk Saturday afternoon. There's one in a museum. I think it's like that London Museum. What one? What? Well, do you know, like, how people are buying weird stuff and that to put in museums? Yeah. There's this device. I mean, think about it. Years and years ago, they used to torture people, didn't they? Yeah, really badly. And the device, there's no real good torture, but. Go on. I see your point. Yeah, but this, this device, right, Think about it. You've done something really bad years ago. Yeah. Right. And you're thinking, oh, what are they gonna do? Do you know what I mean? Could do anything here. It could be the end for me. The device they've got is this thing that you put on your. Your bits as a fella, and it's sort of metal, so it means you can't sort of, you know, get excited. It puts a stop to you, sort of. That wasn't a torture device. I think it was a Victorian thing to stop adolescent boys wanking. They used to have things like wrist things as well, with like spikes on them. It's not a torture device, is it not? Well, not really. It's. Imagine that, being captured by. Again, all right, not really a torture device, is it? And there wasn't that many nice looking women wandering about anyway. About them was he didn't get excited about stuff. What are you talking about? Filthy the stonk and everything back then. Right, we've covered that. No more of that talk now. Right, let's move on. Fill this. All Victorian women filthy and stinky. Yeah. Oh, dear. Better. Rolling Stones set up the old Songs of phrase. Stones, Beast of Burden. We've not played it before. It's an absolute gem. The Rolling Stones, Beast of Burden. Can I just take this opportunity, Rick, to. To say to Sir Mick Jagger, happy 60th birthday this year, Mick. Happy 60th birthday this year. Was it today? No. I don't know. Well, otherwise you'd be saying happy Birthday to everyone every day. No, no, no, no, no, because I don't know Mick Jagger, do I? So I'm just taking the opportunity, in case he happens to be listening today, to wish him a. Or someone who knows, he might. What about Brian Ferry? What about Brian Ferry? How's Brian? Well, I mean, he's, he's, he's, he's. I'm not going to wish Brian Ferry a birthday. Brian. Well. Silence is easy. Star Sailor on XFM 104.9. Right, it's the. It's the quiz of the week. If you want to go out and do some shopping, this is probably a good time and come back again for about quarter past. But don't forget, what I will say is, even though these clues. We're gonna do Songs of Phrase, by the way, where Carl picks out a phrase that he might have said once, tries to find words from songs to put it together. You've got to guess as many as you can. Song or artist? I can't remember. But even though you might look and go, that's mental. I don't know any of them. You might win if you get two. Right. I mean, I think the winner last week got about three hours. Well, I have to be honest with you. I mean, last week, I mean, Rockbusters, surprisingly, was very, very popular quiz. Yeah, it just happened to be awful. Yeah, this one is pitiful. I mean, it's truly atrocious and it really doesn't even have a fan base. I mean, there's no one championing this one, Carl, last week. Seriously, mate, I got about, oh, seven. Or eight replies that. Oh God, that's terrible. That was like when you told a kid that you couldn't afford a Christmas present this year. Look at his face. Yeah, he is a bit distraught. It's like Chris Evans face when they said they were canceling Girls and Boys. I can come up with great TV game shows like that. No, you can't, Chris. Not anymore. Oh, his little glasses slid down his nose. I'm the guy who. Don't forget your toothbrush. Yeah, all that money you owe me. No, you owe us. Believe it. All right, so will I just play to you and whatever. Carlos. Sorry. It's a phrase that might have once been uttered on this show. It was said last week. All right, all right. Okay, brilliant. All right, here we go. I know you're just 16, but looking all of 21. Right, I know what that is. That's ridiculous. What it is is it's something like, right, you're only 16, but you look 26. The Chinese look older than they are or something. Because he said that the Chinese don't age well. That is mental, Carl. It's the most convoluted, ridiculous, racist piece of material ever to be uttered on radio play. Again. I know you're just 16, but looking all of 21, that's look older. Okay, here's the 16. 16 and looking on the 21, that's because the Chinese look older, Carl. You've got a mental. Oh, that is amazing. So there you go. The well known phrase, you're 16, looking all of 21, that's because the Chinese look older. Well known phrase there sweeping the nation. That's. That'll be up there with was up and shut that door if they do a poll. Right. Okay, we're after the artist. Just the artist. Yeah, I know you're just 16, but looking all of 21, that's unbelievable. All right, let me tell you what the prizes are. We've got, I assume this is the new album from Mower. Everyone's going crazy for Mower. I've not heard people stop talking about Mower. There it is. We got the new album from the Web Brothers, which might be quite good. The Polyphonic Spree album. The best dance album in the world ever. Which is ideal perhaps if you're having a barbecue and you've got lots of 8 year old children coming. The Polyphonic Spree. I look at them and I think, well, you know, you're pretty good band. But if that album sounds like a Million. You're gonna make about 40 quid each. I know, it's extraordinary. I mean, they're the sort of indie equivalent of the. So Solid Crib. Yeah, you're not gonna make any money. The manager's getting 20%. And also on DVD, Red Dwarf series one. So some absolutely barnstorming, craziest. And if you can identify what artists are using this well known racist phrase, that's because the Chinese look older. Play it once more, Carl, One more time. I know you're just 16, but looking all of 21. That's because look older. Ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk radio panic the Smiths on. XFM 104.9 well, we've got the. We've done the first half hour to know. Mainly janitor related. Then we've kicked in with some racism. You have to guess what. It seems appropriate at this juncture just to mention something that's in the paper today. Dominic Mohan. I know you're a big fan, as am I. He is just writing about the demise of Radio 1, or as he. As he perceives it, and talking about the Radio 1 breakfast show. And apparently it's lost lots of listeners and he says, talking of the BBC, it must act swiftly to replace Sarah Cox and look to exciting and inspirational figures like Jonathan Ross, Alan Deck, Johnny Vaughn or Ricky Gervais to try and save Radio 1. He's right. I mean, has he ever heard this show? What is he talking about? All those other acts, they're dynamite. I can't genuinely. That's someone who said I quite like Ricky Jermaine show, but he's never. He can't have listened. I mean, can you imagine what we just played? In fact, can you imagine the last 50 minutes on Radio 1 on the Breakfast Show? Well, we. Yeah, we could pre record it though, so I wouldn't have to get up early. Sure. That's not your point, is it? That's not really. No. Your point is the quality of what we're doing not well. Sure, sure. Get it, get it, get it. What would you provide though, Ricky, do you think, if you went to Radio 1? What sort of. Because, I mean, obviously I can do all that because I'm. Obviously our time at XFM is gonna. Basically, I'd be the furry shreddy, Right? Yeah. So I'd get that. Would you have some wacky catchphrases? I think I would. You bring back. Holy fook. Holy fuck. Yeah. Oh, ding dong. Oh, hello, it's my little Chinese neighbor. Hello. What's Your name? My name is Holy. Hello. Look at Kylie. Just to go now. He didn't even do the Chinese accent that time. Would that be racist? Okay, sure. I mean, his name's Holy Fuck and there's nothing wrong with not funny about that. So, yeah, you'd have that. You have crazy comedy characters. You probably have some wacky quizzes. Yeah. Oh. Oh, look, it's dirty old queer. Hello. No, I've not. He's a new character to me. I'm quite excited. He sounds very modern and contemporary. Yeah. A new spin on an old idea. Yeah. Just tell us a little bit more. Oh, wow, he's an actor, isn't he? And he likes to take it up. All right, well, that's just some. If anyone from Radio 1 is listening and they've listened to Dominic Mohan in the paper, they thought, yes, you're right, we need some new blood at Radio 1. Ricky Gervais. He's got a myriad of comedy characters. Yeah. Whack, whack. Oops. I can do sound effects. So you can probably do funny voices like Chris Moyles, couldn't you? Yeah, wow. Not as good. But I'm. I can. What about comedy songs like Moyles? Again, not as good. But I mean, do you remember when. Moyles rather hilariously changed the words of this Is My Moment by Martin McCutcheon to this is My Moto? We listened to it. Unbelievable. I remember when he was doing a competition. This was pathetic, wasn't it? We were listening to Radio 1 once on our house, right. And I don't know why, we just wanted to. I think it was research, wasn't it, for the office? Yeah. And he was doing this. He had to phone in with. We were listening to Idiots and. No, I'm not saying that. And he was doing this competition. You had to call in with some songs that are golf related and people were throwing up going, drive the cars. He was going, drive the cars. Good. And I was on that phone. I must have wasted about 40 quid and I wanted to get through and go, hello, Chris, it's not Mosey. Mosey. Yeah, it's Derek here. Derek here. I got one, got one. Oh, go on then, Derek. What is it? Something like Spandale Bally with golfy golfy golf cart and that. And I just wanted. And I waited. I thought, the joke's on us. Yeah. I waited the phone bill just to say something stupid. Oh, dear. Oh, this show's better than this. Yeah. Anyway, if you've got any hilarious golf related songs, titles that you'd like to email in. What's the number? I'd let them email in. Ricky.gervaisfm.com. what would a song title be if perhaps we were doing something about, I don't know, air travel? Yeah. If you've got any crazy ideas emailing, we'd love to hear them. Yeah, brilliant. I've got a thought of another golf one. Okay. You know, Duran Duran Summit down the fairway or something like that. All right, girls? On the putting green. Yeah, all right. Oh, hello, my name's Holy. I'm Dirty Old Queer. I could do all that. Ding Dong Wack. Wang. Oops. Elbow. Fallen Angel. See, they're the odd one out, you see, because. Because of what they're like and who they are and how successful they are. I can imagine saying, will, welcome to the stage. Elbow. Indeed. But I wouldn't have. I'd have. On paper, I'd have thought that was. A terrible band name. Yeah, yeah. No, I know what you mean. There are exceptions to the rule. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage the Boomtown Rats. Yeah, yeah. See, I thought that was a. I think it is a bad name, but you can't imagine it. Yeah, happening. Yeah. Yeah. So there's a bad name. So call in if you got an email address, isn't it? Let's call him. With funny observations on life. And that's halfway through. Yeah, it's been all right. It's been all right. Yeah. We've covered a lot of bases. We haven't taught. Taught them anything. Not taught them anything. Well, we taught them to tune into a different station. Yeah. I think heart 106.2 is probably picking up a few. Few of our listeners as we speak. Yeah. Who's on at the moment? Don't know. Doesn't matter on there, does it? They just sort of. Don't slag them off. No, I'm not slagging them off. I'm just saying I don't think you're tuning because you want to hear Simply Red and that. Don't you know what I mean? Well, they play other great stuff as well. Magic is the one that I love because I only ever listen to it in a cab. Yeah. If I'm in a mini cab. That's good. That is a good station. But magic is dynamite. But I know magic. The DJs have got like five hour shifts. It's incredible. They're all. And. And they do read their own news. I know. It's like they've cut out any expenditure on that channel. It's just some Old records. Yeah. One guy has to go for five hours, read his own news, his own travel. It's nothing else. I saw bloke stone or bloke struggling once. He sort of wants to be a bit of a sort of comedian and he does one link. It's sort of one sort of 15 second link between each record because it goes. That's Celine Dion. There's a story in the paper again that people were late for work on the underground because there was leaves on the track. Just wondering if leaves are ever late for work because there's people on the track. It's simply red. Oh, bless him. He's got to come up with them. For like five hours. He's been sweating. Thought I was going on the kilns thing in the story about war on Iraq. Imagine if I can't do this anymore. I can't imagine if humans becoming stinks dinosaurs. I don't know what I'm doing. Look at Carl's face when I said that. The man moth. Yeah. They've cloned a man moth. No, but that's. That's the sort of thing I think we need now. Right. We've covered a lot of stuff. What, education? Yeah. Well, okay. What. What do you want to know? Don't know. Have you got something? Can you educate us on anything? I've been reading. So could we bring back just for one, one for one night only, Educating Ricky. Oh, I'm excited. Yeah. Do you think it warrants that? I don't. I don't know enough about it. You know what I mean? About what? It sounds perfect. Play the jingle. Oh, Educating Ricky. He's getting smarter. A couple of things happened in the week that I read about. Okay. Keeping up on what's going on in that. Sure, yeah. One was about that Galileo fella. Okay. Was it about 1636, was it? I think it might have been earlier. Go on. Did some stuff. We light and that. Yeah. It did lots of physical experiments. Yeah. Is that it then, Carl? Is it? What did he do with light? What was that? Well, he did. He. Well, he. I think he invented the first telescope. Yeah, telescope. So I think it's a particular lens. I left that. And he did experiments where he dropped two famously two different weighted balls from Pizza Pisa and they hit the ground at the same time, showing that doesn't matter, the weight doesn't matter, air resistance does and stuff like that. I think he probably explained it a bit better than that. Yeah, but I'm talking to Carl. Did they need to know? He's just Thinking about pizza. Yeah. Did they need to know stuff like that back then? What do you mean? Did they need to know stuff like that? It's just. It's just there weren't people going around. Going, I've got to drop these two things off the bleeding tower of pizza. I just don't know which one's gonna land first. Yeah, I need to know what you need to know. Yeah, it's for a bet. Yeah. No, but if I was knocking about, then I'd be like, stop messing with that. We need a telly. Or. He thinks the Flintstones is real. I know. That'd be great. That's what I do. If I was a caveman, I'd make a telly out of rot. Yeah. And the pelican cement mix ran along the road. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. We need the car. Well, we haven't really got the internal combustion engine. Can you stick your feet through the bottom? Yeah. Just get me a car, for Christ's sake. Anyway, so I learned that and then what? He learned his name. Other people I learned the name of this week. Oh, if a chimp could watch telly. Go on, Carl, go on. And there was also a fella in the Week who said that women shouldn't be wearing trousers. Why? Because they don't look good in them. Right. And who is this man? And from what? French fella. French fella last week, did he mean walk around naked? He just said women should wear skirts rather than trousers because. No, women looks good in a pair of pants. Right. How old was he? He's probably about 67. About 67? 68. Yeah. Yeah. Wasn't happy with that. What do you think? What do you think about that? It's rubbish. Yeah. These are the only things that have caught your eye over the last couple of weeks. This is the entire. Galileo did something with light. A French fella said women shouldn't wear trousers. See, that. That, to me, wouldn't pass as education. It's not education. I don't know where you could ever use that. I don't know when that would ever be applicable to life. I just like reading stuff that sort of reminds me of. Do you know what I mean? If I read it and it gets me thinking, I think that's. That's a good little piece. But I mean, but surely me, can't you just sit near some of the vibrates to keep your brain going or shake your head every now and again? I mean, what. What does this do you mean? It makes you start using your brain? But what aspect of the A Frenchman said women shouldn't wear trousers. Got your mind working? What questions were you asking? That's a bit. That's a bit daft, isn't it? Right, yeah. Okay. There's nowhere else for me to go on that. Your mind's still worrying. Yeah, go on. What do you think? Let's go through this. I wish we could download his thoughts. Watch it. Yeah, really great. Like a dvd. Imagine that. Extra footage on the office dvd. Yeah. Carl's brain. That would be amazing. Oh, with a commentary. Go on. Women wearing. Wearing trousers and that. Right. On the estate that I grew up in. On. On. Right. There was a woman out four houses down. Right. Right. Rough. She's the one. She was all the estate. She was. Yeah. She's the one whose kid took a horse into our house. Yes. Bye now. We won't go over that again. No. If you're a new listener, I think we covered. I think they get. That's all you need to know. All right? Yeah. Now, she used to wear leggings. Now, they're a bad idea. They are a terrible idea. I agree with you there, Carl. If you're a lady of what? The normal. Were they pink? No, they were sort of black, but with all bits on them. All right. You know what I mean? Toast and just horse droppings. Yeah, go on. Yeah, and she used to. She's quite a big woman. Sure. Pauline Quirk, I think, looked like a. Light bulb that are attracted to leggings. Yeah, I know. Yeah. They are drawn to them like a moth. Yeah. She used to wear them and that's what I remember when I read this piece. She used to work on one of those sex line things. Right, right. She used to do that. But what was she, an engineer? The weird thing. The weird thing with her. She had big eyelids that. That were too big. And this. This is what I was thinking. What do you mean she had big eyelids? How big do I just have to be for you to go, they're big eyelids? What was she shoplifting with them? Would she come out of Dixon's with, like, radio stored in them? What do you mean she had big eyelids? It was another one of them popular things around our way. Do you know? What do you mean, popular things? Can I get some big eyelids, please? No, no. It was just like one of them things that people suffered with just big eyelids. They could hardly open their eyes. What do you mean? What do you mean? That's one of the popular things around where I grew up. People had big eyelids. They could hardly open their eyes. What does that mean. What sort of freak town were you born in? You had webbed feet, people with big heads, you got women with big eyelids. What does big eyelids mean? Are you confusing her with the horse? Yeah, yeah. Did she have hooves? Look. What? Just. Just too much skin. It was like the. The neck of a chicken, but on the eyes. What's your point? Anyway, so there's this big eyelid woman with the legs. That's what I'm saying to you, though. That's when I read that story with people with trousers. Yeah. I went from that. Yeah. To a woman who used to have big eyelids. Stay I still on the point. But then, but then. And also the other bloke who I had the eyelid problem was a. Was a mate of mine, right. His dad had it and same problem. Massive, massive eyelids. I don't know what that means. I don't know what that means. I used to say to me, mama, I'm going around to, you know, Dave's house. Yeah. And that's all right, but make sure his dad doesn't take you out in the car because he could hardly. He could hardly see. He had to have his head. He had to tilt his head back to keep his eyes open. Sure. Did he have a couple of matches with him at all times? A load of comedy gook. This began as Educating Ricky. I know he was thinking with eyelids. But it's like you're supposed to make that leap as well. Yeah. If I mentioned the trousers, Ricky probably be thinking about people with big eyelids and women wearing leggings. Play record Carl got nonsense advert. No. All right, Muse, time is running out on XFM 104.9. Just a couple of emails, just to update you on what's coming in here. Natasha has emailed us. She says that she's of Chinese origin and at 27, she often got mistaken for 24. So your notion that Chinese people don't age well is obviously factually incorrect. Yeah, well, we didn't need. Thank you for saying. But I mean, honestly, trust us, Natasha, we didn't need you to tell us that. We know Carl is talking absolute nonsense. Wait till you get to 30. Oh, dude, this is. This is quite a nice email from Paul. He says, let Carl know that I have a Chinese friend called Oi. Imagine the confusing and amusing situations we get into. We're out and about in busy Soho. Is your surname. Come here. Lightning witness till you're 30. Yeah, I know, brilliant. But no, actually, we've had a surprising response to Songs Of Phrase this week. Despite the fact everyone has agreed that it's racialist. But nevertheless, they had a go. So keep your answers coming in because we may as well. You're a hit, Carl. You're here. What have we still got? Monkey News? Yeah, that's still coming up. Yeah, later on. We're not doing Cheeky Freak of the Week anymore. We're not? No, no. Don't want to upset people on that. Sure. But there is a good freaky program on this week. Go on. I think it's on Channel four. Yeah. A woman. A woman with a big head on it. No, I think it's BBC2. Is it? Yeah. All right. Unless there's two on, because that'll be a great week for you, wouldn't it? Brilliant. Won't be coming out. The one when you said gone. Right. Say what you said when you saw it. The woman with the. With the ad. Yeah. Just said it looks like a cartoon. That's so mean. I don't want to discuss it. No, it's not. It's not mean. It is mean, Carl. Again, Steve, if we were in a restaurant and I'm arranging to meet her, and I said to the guy on the door, I'm meeting, you know, Lisa or whatever her name is. Yeah, right. What does it look like? Well, looks like a cartoon. I'll be over there. Do you know what I mean? I don't think he'll get mixed up. What would you say about me and Steve again? If you're meeting us. No, it just starts getting nasty, doesn't it? I'm meeting Carl Pilkington. We're very busy yet. What does he look like? He looks like Charlie Brown grew up. He's got a complete little round bald head and he's got a gourmand, honest look on his face. He's over there, mate. Yeah, all right. That started the ball rolling for you, Carl. I love that, that it's okay to say what you like about people if you go. Yeah, but if I was looking for her in a restaurant. I know, but. Yeah, and why have you arranged to go on a date with this woman? Pick a night out for her for you? Well, I'd like to have a chat with her. I mean, just find out what worries her and. You know what I mean, because some girls, people like you, being a mess and that. Yeah. With her, it's like we see problems. Yeah. I mean, fine. All right, well, let's move on, mate. We're not doing Cheeky Freak of the Week anymore. No, let's do something nice. Let's talk nicely. What's happened? Nice. In the world, Carl, what do you like in the world when you get up and you go, oh, that was a brilliant day? I. What do you do when you go, oh, that was brilliant. We had a game. Last game of snooker. You like snooker, don't you? I mean, you and Steve played snooker last week. Yeah, but things are always ruined, you know what I mean? I might be having a nice time, having a game of snooker, and then, you know, we're having a proper battle and I'm trying to concentrate on taking a shot. And then you'll say things like, look at his little monkey hands and I'm going for the black. Do you know what I mean? Or maybe I'll say, I'm just going to the toilet. And then one of you will follow me in and peer over the. Over the door. That was when you're actually in a cubicle sitting down, wasn't it? And Steve Merchant's head appeared and went, all right. And you went, what if that wasn't me? Oh, that was great. Doing a George Michael on me. That is one of the benefits of being very tall. You can look over. You can look over the stalls in twin lavatories. It looked like a giraffe house. You're sitting down there and you look up, right? And he's peering over the top. All the fun we have. Oh, it's great in it. But anything intelligent. It's like the Monkeys. We are like the Monkeys, aren't we? As we. I wanted to write a thing for the Darkness. I want to write a. Like the. The new Monkeys. Yeah. Do I do that? Yeah. All right. Yeah. Okay. Well, if they're listening or their radio show, a record company listening, or their manager. Big fan of the Darkness. My favorite. Hang on. Don't make a promise. My favorite band at the moment. Let's. We'll do a pilot running around. Speed it up. They can have their songs knit. They can write songs especially for us. What if they can act and it's them. They can act. They just act themselves running around. We're getting people like Henry what's it mcgee and that, to come in and sort of be the actors and, you know, all those posh actors that. That appear in Ali G in. That sounds like a lot of hard work. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. For Knock on the Head. Yeah. Let's play Radiohead. Radiohead. And let down off. OK. Computer on XFM 104.9. Right. Let's think of some nice stuff then. Annoyed I was yesterday Go on. Just got off the train and Guy comes up to me and he says, excuse me, can you spare some change? I'm. I'm from Liverpool and I'm homeless. And I was so angry. I really. I was in a bad mood anyway. And I just wanted to say to him, well, there's your mistake. Go back to Liverpool. Liverpool. That's why you're homeless. You're in London. Well, he might have been homeless in Liverpool and thought, why'd you come down here? Well, where would you rather be homeless, Liverpool or London? Well, Algarve. Well, no, but I mean, I'd certainly. Yeah, I mean, just. What, why supposed to say, I'm from Liverpool, I'm almost. Why is that supposed to be a persuading factor? Just annoyed me. I thought, there's enough problems here. He's going for a double. Double sympathy vote. Yeah. He could have just said, I'm from Liverpool. I'd have given him some change from Manchester. Once I gave him a side. Gave him my sandwich. Yeah. There's a thing the other night, right, they did this program, it's only on in London, so if you listen out of London, you won't know about it, but it's about Oxford street, right, and. About all the thieving that goes on. It's like, thieving, yeah. You know, drug problems in the streets and that. Yeah. You know what gets on people's nerves, Those people with the boards, you know, golf, sail and all that. And there's this bit that concentrated on the homeless problem, right? And he said, you know, this fella looks after the homeless. He goes up to him, says, how you doing? Are you hungry? You need food and that. He said, you know, a lot of people worry about the homeless, but we do try and look after them. And the Salvation army were there and they said, and this is where they can come if they need anything, if they need any food or any clothes, if the shoes are worn out. And they said, oh, can we have a look at that? Right, so they go in this little room where all the clothes are and they go. And there's. There's like a load of jumpers for them in the winter, in the cold. And the camera sort of pans across load of ties, right, for the homeless. What ties for the homeless? Round the neck, like to look smart. No, they use them as belts. I've seen a lot. Or as a lead for their dog. Yeah. What are you talking about? Tight? That's what they did. They said, and there's the room with all the stuff in it. For the homeless. Jumpers, shirts and you took a load of ties. Nobody wanted some evening dress. Any cravats? Now, where's the cummerbunds? I'm thinking of being homeless outside the Royal Albert hall tonight. That's where the real pickings are. I'm breaking in the back door of the Savoy this evening. Another charity thing that I was reading about the other day that they do. They give them trainers because I've seen a lot of tramps with new trainers and I think they must be like a, like, equivalent of a soup kitchen where they get shoes, because that's. It must be. Yeah. Otherwise that's weird, isn't it? You get a. You blow any money, you beg all day and get a nice new pair of Nike. Yeah. Don't waste it on clothes. Get some tennis. Get some. Yeah, Special brew. That's the best value. Got some smack if you got a lot of worries on the street. Little start. Yeah. That's weird you say that because, you know, a trainer is the most important thing because, like, you know, all the problems in Africa. Sure, right. A lot of problems going on there. The other day, they're asking for people to send their spectacles to Africa. Right. Would you be happy if you were over there and, like, you're hungry and that, and then they say, here you go. Well, yeah, it must be for a reason. I don't think they've got bad eyes in that. Yeah, I know, but I don't think they go around. It's not like when you see those things on Live Aid and there's people dying, but they're putting specks on them. No, I think that's what it is. No, it's not, Carl. They saw our food and medication before they put a little pair of specs on the lads. That isn't how he came across in the advert. I think they probably walk hand in hand. You know, the people handing out the food are also, you know, walking alongside guys with the specs and they're handing them out as well. But what if they got to look at that? What? They don't own anything. They'll. They'll realize how bad everything is. God, it's rubbish here. Is it? I tell you, I try and help out the world. I've joined a little charity thing. They pay me £5amonth. Yeah. I'm all up for helping. Yeah, but sometimes you think, what can we do? You know what I mean? What can we do? Okay, what can we do? We can't do anything. Okay. We were talking about the Debt. The other day I was reading up on the amount of debt that South Africa in and that. And it's just like, that's without any shops. Do you know what I mean? If they had shops to spend the money on, there'd be murder. Third World debt isn't because they bought too many smeg fridges from us. Shopping, look. He's been shopping. I have. Oh, well, you've gone over the top. You're on a budget now. You're getting nothing but grain and blankets for the next year because you go mental. Oh, God. What's coming? Single from the Thrills, that's called Santa. Cruise on XFM 104.9. We were just talking about people who do good work, you know, wandering up and down Oxford street, giving stuff to the homeless. And they. And I was at a little. They have a little kind of music festival back in my hometown of Bristol periodically in the summer. They can never really attract any decent acts, but, you know, we supported. Not even caught his head. No, they were tricky. No, no, no, no, no, no. I think. Well, this year it was Robert Plant who sang lots of old blues covers and people were quite bored until he played Whole Lot of Love at the end and then we sort of went re. He should have done all the old Led Zeppelin. Stop playing all this other nonsense we're not interested in. So I always set this. But I just snuck off into the woods for, you know, a waz. Because I'm quite rock and roll like that. And I was passing and these are a group of people and I've always thought they never get enough praise, enough credit. And I genuinely. And I mean this without entirely sincerely, I really do. I don't mean to be. I'm not taking the lick at all. But the St. John's Ambulance people, they're absolutely blinding. Because they are. They all look like nerds. I mean, they all look like kind of. Because they're normally kind of fat women or kind of. Or kind of blokes. I think you're doing very well for their. Their new recruitment campaign. Well, I think you're selling it to people who want to. This is my point, Rick, is that they've not changed the uniforms in like 40 years. And it is normally. Yeah, it's normally the kind of. The nerds from your school who went into it or whatever. It's kind of old people. I saw them. They were all sat around in this little area. No one was. You know, nobody just sat around. They were bored. They weren't really enjoying the music. And I thought, look at that. They're not knock that fat kid of. I pointed him out to my mate, I said, see that fat one over there in the uniform with the glasses. And the hairbrush forward. With the glasses, hairbrush forward. The kind of blue navy jumper satchel. This little satchel, yeah. He is never gonna get off with a girl probably until he's like 30. And even then he gets to loosen clothes. And even then it's good because he's giving mouth to mouth to her. Yeah, right. And I thought, he's never gonna get anything. And I'll tell you this, all these trendy young girls walking around in their. In their. In their kind of, you know, cool summer gear, in their trendy tie dye and the like, I'd say, tell you, when one of them, you know, takes something that's a little bit dodgy, they bought off some guy with dreads, right? And then they're desperate for him and they zip in there, oh, quick, quick. My friend's, you know, passing out. She's had something. She's had a funny turn and he's straight there with his water and his medication. Oh, yeah, they need him then. But he doesn't get any action the rest of the time, you know, that's what annoyed me. But I thought, they're doing a bloody good job. They turn up at sports events, at festivals, no one gives them the time of day. You never any good praise about them. And they're there sat there. Steve, hot or cold, tell me the truth now, now, did you join the St. John's ambulance last week to get some birds? No action, really. And I've been passing some dodgy eaves around all the festivals. By the way, your dreads are awful. You can see they're fake. They made out of newspaper. They're awful. You really do look an idiot. But seriously, I'm all joking aside, I genuinely wanted to give some massive props if I could give some big ups to the St. John's people, because I genuinely, without any joke, and I genuinely think they do a brilliant job. Could I just say how good I think, I think the Salvation army are? Because you see those elderly ladies with surgical supports, a lot of them all look like Thor Herd. Yep. Well, that's a prerequisite to get into that army. And they play that bloody tambourine, rain or shine. Yeah. And they are just. All they're trying to do is, you know, save you from burning in hell. And they don't get any respect of. The Salvation army, do they? Like, would they have to get called up. Yeah. It'd be the Gurkhas first, then all the regulars, then the task. I think then it's. I think then it's sort of like police, lifeguards. Lifeguards, yeah. Down to. Down to, I think, aa. And then it's Salvation Army. Right. We send in the Salvation army, obviously, if, you know, really, I've lost a lot of. Yeah. Casualties, you know, and they're the last to go. Yeah. But they are all highly trained, aren't they? All those old women, they can kill a man. Yeah. With a single blow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So good. Good to them. Good to the John's Ambulance. Good to Salvation army, you know, big up. But I think we should just, you know, if I might introduce a new feature every week. Let's just give some props. Let's just give some massive respect to someone who doesn't get enough respect. Yeah. Who doesn't get enough respect, who's done a blinding job. Mother Teresa. She's gone now. She's gone. She won't be listening anyway. Who's the best person? Who's the best person there is? I'll tell you what we're gonna take. I'm gonna call either Carol Vorderman or Esther Anson and say it was the best one you've ever met that, you know, did summer. Yeah. All right. And we'll. And we'll keep praise upon them next week. Yeah, great. What I just don't like, you know, they know. They know they're doing a good job, right? If I did that job, I want a pat on the back. You wouldn't need a pat on the back. And people are starting to, you know, it's like, Carol Vorderman, I like her. She's all right. She does a good job. But now that better homes, they only tend to turn up at people who have had problems. Do you know what I mean? Right. Wait, wait, wait. Go on. What do you mean? No, it used to start off and. It'S like, I haven't seen better homes. What is better? They go around, do someone's house up, right. You know what I mean? But then they get. They get a bit of bad news and Carol thinks, I'll cheer him up. I'll give him a new kitchen. Yeah. And it annoys me because if you haven't had bad news, it doesn't mean you're not worth a new kitchen. Did you send in an application? You say that I'm. I'm bald, I'm from Manchester. Well, if he'd written that they'd have rushed around. Yeah. What do you mean? What they. They say so and so's had a bad year, his mum died, he lost his leg and all he's ever wanted is a chaise long and a hostess trolley. And the annoying thing is, right, they might not be the ones who write in, it might be a neighbor, but they also get something sorted out for them, really. So even though the neighbors had a bit of bad news, they go cash in on this one. I'll send a letter into old Carol, tell her that, you know, Mum's passed away. Yeah. I'll get a new conservatory sorted. Sure. And sometimes a neighbor gets a better deal than the person who. Do you know what I mean? The person who's had a bit of bad news. Yeah. Gets like a new little kitchen. Whatever neighbor next door, let it go. New decking in the. You had to pay for your kitchen. You know what I mean? Sorted. Bathroom. You had trouble with the grouting, didn't you? Yeah, yeah. I don't know. We haven't got. We got to do. Oh, look, play a record. We've got to do the results and then we got do monkey news. Could we quickly do the results? Well, you say we've got to do the results. There's not people hanging on for them. Just knock it out of there before. Well, let's play tune. Let's come out and do it. Eddie, not rods. Yeah, surely Eddie and the hot rods. Do anything you want to do. That's uplifting in it. Oh. Oh, the drumming. Brilliant. Takes me back all the way back to 1970 on XFM. 104.9. What were you doing? What were you doing? What are your memories? I was actually probably dancing around, miming the drums to that in the bedroom. In fact, I remember. Were you nude? No, no, I remember. I think I had that on a single, but I'd got it from an old jukebox, so it didn't have a middle. Sure. Right. I think they're called dinked. Right. And so I had to line it up really carefully and sometimes by the end it would just slightly go out where the record was moving, where I just had to. Interesting anecdote there. First day. Yeah, yeah. What a lovely insight. Did you ever ask me what I was doing in 25 years ago? Carl, quick. The results. They're monkey news. I need some monkey news. But I need the results first. I play it again and give the answers. Here we go. Songs of phrase. Name the artist. Name the artist. I know you're just 16 but looking old. Cry. That's Philip Bailey again. That's too little. Right. That was Rock Set. The look. Yeah, yeah, right, we had you and Cry started off. Yeah. 16. That was Dean Martin because. Oh, yeah. Jane Addiction. Yeah, yeah. Chinese. Philip Bailey. Philip Bailey. That's second out in his ad. Last one. We used him for Chinese. Where there's a hairy Chinese kid. He's never got too many royalties. Being used in racists game shows. Brilliant, Ben. Rock set. And finishing with George Michael. Oh, yeah. So brilliant. Who's the winner? Well, the winner, actually, it looks to me like he's got all of them here. From Bognor Regis, it's Stuart Birch. Well done, Stuart. And you get that bag, bag of tat. Bognor Regis. Yep. Oh, just needed back as well. Yeah. If you don't, just email in your address, Stuart, and you can have those goodies. If you're not interested, don't bother, Steve. Oh, chimpanzee that. Monkey news. Okay. Monkey related news from Clive Pilkington. Right. Do you know the monkey that went into space? Yeah, Yep. It happened in 1958. Right. Now, you know that? Yeah, yes. What did he do next? What did the monkey do next? One appearance on Celebrity Squares and it was like forgotten. Right. Yeah. Cut a novelty record. Yeah. It's just like Rick Waller. I'll tell you what happened. He got back. Heroes welcome. NASA sort of said, you know, you did a good job. Yeah. And that's where a lot of people think, you know, it all ended. Sure. Yeah. But NASA were like, well, hang on a minute, time. We've trained him up and stuff. So he's like, you know, he's saying, sure, sure, you know, I've learned a lot. I've still got it all, I've kept it all. I know what to do. So they said, right, we'll use you. So he turned into like a bit of a trainer. Send you out on the top of an organ. Put on this little bellhop. Could you smoke fags? I'll have a go. So it was. They were getting in new monkeys, you know, the. The main man at NASA was saying, can you teach you as the same? He's going, of course I can. You know, I mean, I remember it all. I know what's going on. I'll tell them what button to press, what to do in emergencies, that sort of thing. It was technically sort of employed by the army. Right. Can I just fit in here? I. I don't know the story, Carl, and I might embarrass myself here. You've got an army of people out there that are probably send me an equally deranged email from a different website. But I'm pretty sure when they sent the monkey into space, it was to monitor his physiology. He didn't. He didn't press any buttons or learn to dock or take off. It just. It was just the effects of weightlessness and space on basically a primate. I'm pretty sure he was tied in with electrodes to his head, so. Well, yeah, I'm pretty sure. But even if that were the case and he had Learned to press 1 or 2, very basic. But definitely not. Definitely not. Even if it were the case, I'm pretty certain they wouldn't have brought him back to train up Neil Armstrong. Right, Definitely. Keep going, Neil. What you gonna say when you come out there? Yeah, yeah, I was thinking of just saying, I know I'm on the middle. It'S made of cheese. Don't say that. What about, I've noticed that you got little legs. Right. But mankind stepped forward. Well, how could I put that? I was just gonna say, oh, I'm on the moon. It's great to be here. I wish you were here. I gotta think so. Yeah, go on. Anyway, basically he got back, they sorted him out with a nice pension. He was happy because of like the rank that he got. He was like, you know, he had loads of medals and stuff. They said, right, we'll make him a colonel. He got. Like I said, he got a pension and he died in 1969. He was buried with his wife. He passed away. His wife. I'm sure. I'm sure it just goes onto a different website about something really different. You're talking about Buzz Aldrin. Yeah. His page is missing. Oh, dear. So, well, that Carl, I'm. If someone could call in. Did they train like the dog to sort of like, you know, Doc and Reb? Did he, like. They didn't bother. They didn't even bother. They just sent him up there and then they didn't have technology to bring him back and they just went, yeah, that's. That's brilliant. Well, I can do that. Yeah. Amazing. Really? Yeah. I think that Carl rubbish in it. Sort of brought it down a bit. But the little monkey made a colonel hero, big hero. What was he in? Locks Craft? Was he in Sputnik? He was in Jupiter Am, yeah. Let me see that piece of paper. Yeah. I can guarantee there's nothing there about is training other than let's hope he's not sick on the control panel when we shoot him up at 400 GS. Oh, dear. I love the fact that you think this monkey was a height. Do you know what I mean? When you think of these things that are nesting among his face, do you think of the Planet of the Apes? Like they're sort of talking sort of chimps and gorillas and they're. They're in tunics on horseback with snub nosed rifles. What does he think of? Just a little monkey getting on with it. He knows his job, he knows what he's got to do. Gets on with it. Look, he's pressed the button. Watch him press the button. This takes me back. Do you remember 1965? I think it was. We're gonna use him to train other DJs. That's it then. Goodbye. Thanks. Cheers. Cheer.",
