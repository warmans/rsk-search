We've got a great show lined up this week, haven't we? Gone. What have you got planned? Well, I've got songs from David Bowie, Thin Lizzie, Gene ac, DC Heard, Feeder, they got oh, oh, Smiths, all that. We got a great feature, a new feature. We spoke to Khan the week and we worked out a new feature where people are gonna give him sort of like problem to solve. There could be scenarios, there could be management scenarios at work, you know, problem solving, things like that, organizing things. He's a very good organizer. So I'll tell you what, tell you what happened. He's dropping. Do we need him? Because he's getting fed up with scientists. He thinks there's a conspiracy and they're getting together and they're never going to lose an animal, right? So he's just fed up with that Rock busters. We've got some great prizes. Well, have you seen them yet? No. Be careful, they're not gonna be great. I just peaked in and all I'm gonna say to you is Fools and Horses Christmas special. Not the little one with a little car. Yeah, brilliant. That is excellent. Carl, what have you. Save yourself. Hold on. It was a rollover, wasn't it? Because you really mucked up Rockbusters last time. What is he doing saying FP for the whole thing? No, fd you were saying and it was free to pain. Have you written the clues down this week? Cuz that seems like an obvious way to improve this. Yeah, I write the clues. Before he couldn't remember what the answer was. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you know, you learn by your mistakes and that you don't. Well, so I'll give you a little taster. But we were having a pizza in a, in a pizza establishment. When was it? Wednesday or Thursday? Yeah, and he was going, I'm a good organizer, I'm a good problem solver. Give me any, any scenario. Right. Obviously he didn't say scenario. And I went, okay then, so you're the manager of this place and there's a couple there, elderly couple, they're about 60, they've had a lovely meal. He went, yeah, right. I went. But the, the gentleman, he's got a little bit of a heart condition. He takes a pillow after his meal, as he should after he was. He's only taken Viagra and now he's stuck in, wedged in. Wedged in. It's gone and it's stopping him getting out from the table. So what would you do? He went, what? He stuck in because of his dick? I went, yeah. He went, right. He said, I'd use the situation, I'd make cash. Said, you're not going anywhere. Do you want a pudding? Entrepreneurial. I like it, Carl. Anyway, so that's that sorted. I've got the job on that. Next. I went, okay. Another. Oh, you won't believe it. Next day, there's a little problem in the toilets. Two. Two gay men were having sex and they got stuck. Yeah. Yeah. He went, right. I'd say, is it the same fella. Yeah. As yesterday with the Viagra? If so, why was he let in again? He was on the door. Yeah. I went, it's not. It's too dude. Right. Does his wife know he's cheating on him? Yeah. He went, right. I'd go down. I'd go. And then he went, oh, I say, this isn't a restaurant problem. Call an ambulance. Strictly speaking, not a restaurant problem. No, but. All right. Huh. Am I right? Well, I don't know. Would you give me the job if, say, like, you were the boss of that restaurant? Do you know what I like about this? At no point did he say, germaine, why are you being so mental? Yeah. Why would someone get stuck because they took Viagra Mistake. And two people get stuck in each other. But you heard the stories from his past. That is a perfectly legitimate situation. You find yourself in his. What would you do if there was two fellas with big heads and webbed feet and they had a horse in a. Well, what I do is. What would you do? What did you do when you first saw them? What, saw the lads with the big heads? Yeah, yeah. We should very quickly remind people if they didn't listen to that particular show, they had webbed hands. Did they? Or webbed feet. Well, they had webbed hands. Right. And big heads. Enormous heads. But it wasn't related. But they weren't related. But I'm saying that the webbed hands isn't due to the fact they've got a big head. No, sure. It's two different things. We're just unlucky. No, hold on. If they weren't related and they both had webbed hands and big heads, I'm saying there was a condition that was related, that had those two. I don't think there was. So what do you think the chances of that are? They're not related and he Goes, oh, you've got a big head. And web dance as well. Yeah. Just a coincidence, innit? Yeah. I honestly don't think it was related. Right. Because I've. I've seen. I've since seen the same problem again on another kid with a big head. Jan's look good. Right. So you think the big head is just a separate issue? Yeah, it's a totally different illness. It's like having a headache and a cold at the same time. Right. So not always connected. But the weird thing is, right, looking around in the week at weird stuff on the. On the Internet, there's this woman who's got a big head. Oh, yeah. And she was fed up with it because when she was walking down the street, it was so big she couldn't hold it up. Right. She couldn't hold it up. Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay, keep. Shut up. So when she was walking, her eyes were hurting because she had to sort of look up all the time because her head was that heavy. Her chin was sort of balanced on her chest. Right. And she'd have to peek up. Yeah. So she goes to the doctors and this was after years and years and said, you know, I thought I could put up with it, but I can't. How big was her head? I don't know if it was like big because there wasn't a picture. I don't know if it was just big or a lot of bone. So it was heavy. Right. Like the Elephant man, just so outcrops. So. So the doctor said, yeah, we can sort that out, but we'll have to take your head off. Right, okay, listen, keep going because I. Again, what you don't seem to understand is I. I have the same reaction to you when I see it. Yeah, you're quizzical yourself. So they took her head off, chipped away a bit of the bone, made her head lighter, put it back on. Right, play. The Smiths took a woman's head off. Yeah. This is asked by the Smith and if you'd like to ask Carl something. Details coming up soon. SH. By the Smiths on XFM 104.9 so what's the email? Carl, if people want to ask you something, a problem, they've got a problem to solve. It can be anything. It could be a personal problem, it could be a scenario, it could be about. It could be about war, it could be anything. Or it could be more flippant, I suppose, and like. Yeah, could be. Yeah. But I prefer stuff that I could. See and get your teeth into and. And Actually, you know, sort out what, like, war is too. It's a bit. Bit big for me, that one, do you think? I don't want to get into that. What do you mean? If Tony Blair came to you and he went, carl, listen, I'm having a bit of trouble here. I. I don't know what to do. I've tried everything. I've tried spin, I've tried being tough, I've tried backing down, I've tried getting other countries involved. They don't want to know. What do I do? What do I do? You don't know. I don't worry about it. If it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen in it. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Just get in the bath, put mattress on the. On top of you. That's it. Sorry, why are you doing that? Why are you doing that? That's what they say do, innit? If it kicks off before it kicks off. If there's a war and that, you get in the bath, put a mattress on top. Right. Did they do that in the Second World War? For six years. Was that making bunk beds? That's what I read somewhere, yeah. Is the bath full of water? No, no, no, no, no. Not be daft. Okay. I think they were enamel baths then, though. I think they'd stop a bit of shrapnel. I think the plastic ones you get nowadays would probably melt on you. And the mattress where your dad has cut it in half, all the foam would come out and the springs would get you in the eye. Oh, talking about me dad. Steve, you'll love this. Your dad. 8's Yates being ripped off. Right. Yes. Well, now, I can relate to that. That's important. Eight's coming to London now. He always wants me to go and see them rather than come here because he just thinks London is, like, a big rip off. Last time he came, he got annoyed because I bought him a scone and a cup of tea for, like, three of us and it was 14 pounds, and he just was livid. And then we had an argument about that. And then we went to the Millennium Wheel and I said, do you fancy going on this? He said, oh, all right. And then he saw the price and it was something like 20 quid or something. And he said, 20 quid to go up in the air to look at stuff that's on the ground, so I might as well stay on the ground. Brilliant. Right thought, good point. His logic is impeccable. So, anyway, this is going on anyway. He spoke to me the other day I said, how are things? Alright? No, he said, oh, being ripped off. I said, why? He said he ordered. Do you know the place where he got a new bed from? Because he cut the other one out, of course. Yeah, right. He. He got this bed out of a catalogue. So. So he sorted out a payment on the phone. He said, look, you're ripping me off a bit here on the interest thing, but, well, let's do a deal. We'll sort out a new monthly payment that's different to what it says in the catalogue. And they said, yeah, we'll go along with that. Anyway. So he sorted that out. He was happy the bed arrived. It's a nice bed. He said, that's great. So anyway, he got the bill for it and it was the original price. I thought it might be the case. Yeah. So he called up and said, I'm not happy with this. He said, we said a deal. Oh, no, I don't know what you're talking about. He said, right, don't send me your catalogs anymore. He said, I'm not. I'm not buying anything from you. You're a ripoff merchant. So anyway, few. Few weeks go by, post comes only another catalog in the post. He's livid, right. So he was, well annoyed. Yeah. So he looked on the back and it said, on it, this catalog will always be property of, you know, the company that. That does it. If. So you can't throw it away. If. If we request to have it back, we've got the permission to get it back off you. Right. So he thought, right, well, they're out of order. I told them not to send me one and they have done and they're saying, I can't chuck it away. So he called them up and said, all right, Mr. Pilkington bought a bed off you conned me and that, you know, forget that. We've dealt with that. You sent me a catalogue. I told you not to. It says on the back here that this will always be yours. Yeah. So in a way, you're using my house as a warehouse. I'll be charging you 26 pence or something a day. Brilliant. He said, you already owe me six, £28, something like that. Genius. And, yeah, sorted it out. So again, you know. So hang on, are they going along with this? I don't know what happened. He said they sounded annoyed and said they'd get back to him and they haven't. But he said, I'm not bothered. They can take as long as they want because the money just keeps going Up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What sort of profit has he made so far? Well, when I spoke to him in the week, it was like six pound odd. Yeah, that was. I think that was on Tuesday. So, you know, he's just leaving it. It's like an investment. Yeah, it's like an antique. Yeah, yeah. It's just going up every day, so. Well, keep us posted on that. That's dynamite. One day. We need to speak to your father. Yeah, I think so Many questions need to be asked of him, I might say, and give you a letter to take home. Yeah. Dear Mr. Pilkington, your son, Carl. New single from Nick Cave. I think I'm looking forward to it. Yeah. That'S the forthcoming single from Nick Cave from his album Noctorama. That's called Bring It On. That's great. I must admit, I was a late comer to Nick Cave. I mean, years into his solo stuff before, you know, I decided that he was brilliant. Yeah, fantastic. He's fantastic. I had some exciting news this week, Carl, you'll be pleased to find out. I'm worried that you might get a little bit jealous because it's obviously going to impact on your world quite strongly, because I know you think you'd like things to be quite, you know, samey. You like the status quo to be maintained. You like the fact that in the past, you know, we've had some crosswords, you know, because you've. I remember. What did you think of me when I first walked in, when I first came in on the first day? I don't know why you're making a big deal. I'm just being honest, though. I'm just honest about a lot of people who see you for the first time. Sort of go, well, he's a bit weird. I know that's Dave, that you brought it up and then you're again. But I'm sure that wasn't what he said before. No, he didn't. He said before I. Yeah, it was a bit weird. Yeah. Well, he looked at you and I knew. I could see by the look of his face, you know when, you know your kid and your kid's sort of scared of someone, they go, why'd you keep. Oh, he doesn't like pigeons or spiders. It was like that when I saw Carl and I brought you in and I went, what do you think of that, Carl? I could see, look at his face, that he was disturbed. Sure. And then, as he said, you get used to it, don't you? Yeah, you get used to it. And you have changed a Little bit. Your hair's a bit smarter now and you got some nicer glasses and that, I think. Or I might just get used to it. Wow. Don't bring it up, Steve. Don't look at me like that. So you say that you think some other people in the office thought the same. Do you know that for sure? Did you discuss it, Carl? Yeah, I think. I think they do, yeah. Okay, leave it there then. But not just in the office. As you walk through the building. Oh, it's worse than you ever thought. Well, no, it's not worse than I ever thought because as you well know, Ricky Gervais. What did I do on Thursday morning? Oh, is this the thing? For those that perhaps are not of the female persuasion listening. There's a magazine, apparently it sells quite well. It's one of the sort of female, you know, kind of issues magazines. I think it's called Company Magazine. You know, it's like you're sort of. I guess it's a bit like your Moore or your Vanity Fair. Whatever. Anyway, they run every year, the 50 most eligible bachelors in Great Britain section. Ding dong. Hello. Who's in there this year in the, in the 50. In the top 50 of the entire country. And then they vote. They vote and they put them in order and see who's the most eligible bachelor. But that's. That's 50 people, right? Most. I mean, the. I. It always annoys me slightly because bachelor, it. It kind of seems like a more sophisticated word for loser. Yeah. Which always sort of. They try and do a different 50 every year, so they're getting pretty desperate to get different ones. No, because also a lot of people who are sort of like successful, you know, are married. So there's very little. Go on. There's a huge. I don't know if this is international. It could even be international. I'm not sure, actually. So I could be up there with the likes of Justin Timberlake, etc. So. Fred Durst. Yeah, that sort of person, you know. So anyway, this is what's exciting, right? Although I'm slightly frustrated because they were telling me that last year. All right. Because what happens is the readers of the magazine, they vote for who they think is number one most eligible bachelor. Right. Last year the prize was a two week trip in the Bahamas. Okay. This year I'm rather annoyed because all I'm gonna win is a moped. Whoa, oh, oh. Backtrack. Sorry. Last year was a two week trip to Bahamas. And this year, just a mope. All you're gonna win Is a moped. Yeah. I'm sorry. You got no chance. You've got no chance. Who else is in it? Who else in it? Well, I mean, I don't know. Lots and lots of people you've never heard of. There was. I know Duncan from Blue so. So you're second to him at least already I imagine you're. You're going to come behind the other 49. So because there people voting for me. They get to vote for me. Yeah. Steve, I see my photo for me. Yeah. According to he I was 22nd most sexy man in the world. I better take that helmet back. I would see you shook me all night long on XFM 104.9. Well, this show is a rocking. It is Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. I come up with a new strand for Carl as well. He likes. He's always got, you know, we've done. I don't think there's a weak garment. We haven't mentioned an airy kid, a hairy child. Yeah. And some related to a monkey in that. And I thought you could do a regular thing. He's got to come up with a story about an ape or a monkey and it's called Chimpanzee that. Of course I have got one but I can't remember it at the moment. It'll come to you whenever you join the show. Well, listen, while you're thinking about that, while you're stewing on that, here's a problem that someone's emailed in. We're taking emails today. If you've got a problem, a concern or just a general query that you think Carl could answer for you. It could be about anything. It could be about some of the big philosophical questions. It could be something to do with war or famine, anything like that. Or it could just be a personal dilemma, you know, something that's happening locally. Anyway, this seems one that I think you probably have. You and your father have probably come across this sort of dilemma in the past and I'd be interested to know what your take is on it. Let me see. This is from Lee Matthews by the look of it. He says he lives in a suburban area where the local teenagers also live on the same road and they're running riot. They're smashing wing mirrors off the cars. They're crashing into parked cars on their skateboards. They're just generally making mayhem, you know, night and day. What can he do to stop this going on? The parents of the kids don't seem to give a damn. Anyone who complains to them, they Just say, I'll piss off. You know, the police are useless because they never catch him in the actual act of violence, which is what they got to do to apparently convict them. So they don't know who to turn to, really. It's rather like when a little old lady went and got the A team. You know, and he was dressed as an elderly Chinaman. Exactly. She knew who he was. Colonel Decker didn't have a clue. Yeah. See, it's weird because now. Now it has got out of hand. Sure. I mean, like years ago, when I was growing up on the estate. Yeah, you had problems, but not like you have now. I mean, you know, summers were nice. As well, weren't they? Well, it did seem that way, didn't it? Yeah. Right. And police are getting shorter. But you yourself kind of admitted in the past that you were something of a tear away, that you didn't do anything like these kids here. The thing is, I was. I was scared that if I got caught doing it, my dad would go mad. Yes. And I remember smashing a car window by accident and legging it in the lounge and sort of pretending to go asleep on the settee. And I heard a knock at the. Door, Chloroformed himself just to be unconscious when his dad came home and there. Was a knock on the door and I thought, oh, God, this is a fellow. He saw me. I was chucking a stone in the air, seeing how I could throw it. Did it keep landing on your head? That would explain a lot. It came down. Stone in the air. Love it. Let's see how far I could throw. Brilliant. So, you know, I wasn't bothering anyone. Did you invent that game? Did you get the stone? Your birthday. Go and play with your stone. He gave one to Suzanne. Carl, go and play with your stone. The thing is, right, and it came down at a funny angle and ate the back of this car. And the back window is the most expensive because it has that heating thing in it. Yeah. In case you got frosty window. So. Oh, God. So I legged it in, got on the settee, went to sleep, knocked out the door. Genius. It's a brilliant plan. It's a brilliant plan. I couldn't be guilty. I'm asleep. So I love the idea. So the thing is, our lounge used to sort of. You could. You could see in from the door. Right. So this family who saw me do it, let. Saw me asleep on the settee and my mum said, go and get the door. And I sort of went as if I'd been asleep. Yeah. I went to the door, like, rubbing my eyes, and the fella said, what did you run off for? I saw you. I was like, oh, no. And I didn't see my dad. I went out. It was when he was working, sort of evenings. So I went out so I didn't have to see me dad. And then the next day I came. I came home from school and my dad said, 45 quid. That's all he said. And then you fell asleep and he went, wake up, wake up. No, 45 quid, Carl. He didn't have to do it. £45, Carl. Now, I know you were saving up for a brick, but you can't have it. Yeah, but do you know what I mean? It's like I knew I did wrong and I was scared that my dad was gonna belt me. Yeah. Yeah. So I was like, oh, you know, I'll be more careful next time. But that was clearly good parenting on the part of your F. These young tykes, clearly, they don't have the. What do you do? The father's. I don't even know. I don't know. If you were living in that street very quickly, what would you do? What would your approach be if you were living in history? What if. What if they'd come home, right, and they just vandalized all your pebbles, right, that you've been saving over the years and just threw your gravel away. What would you do if they just. I'd probably clout one of them. So you'd use violence? I think it's the only way sometimes. I don't mean, you know, really bad, but I'd show them that I'm not putting up with this. Right. And then the problem is you've got their family coming around and they're probably quite. Go to sleep. If you hit a kid and the dad comes down, just go to sleep. Yeah. Just equally, if you're doing a bigger crime, you know, a bank job or. A murder, remember to take the stocking off your head because they wake you up and go, why have you got a stocking? Just go, oh, I had a weird dream. It won't work. It's like with our kid, right? He was. I told Ricky about this the other day in the. In the pub, but it's. Is this your brother? Yeah. Because he was a terrorist. Well, yeah, a little bit. But he did drive a tank down the high street ones, didn't he? Yeah, that's when he was in the army. But. But another story. But. But this time I remember my mum and dad were Going out, right, for the evening. And I must have been about, I don't know, five. So our mark was like, I don't know, probably 18, 17, 16, 17, 18. So my mum and dad go out and our mark says to me, right, here's a deal. Do your little deal. I'm gonna have a load of women round, right? Deal is I'll let you have your tractor in the house. Wow. He had a tank. You had a tractor. Yeah, but. Yeah, but his brother didn't have the rocks, that car. No. So he needs the tractor to put his toys along. Was he brought a bunch of women around. So, yeah, there's loads. But, you know, when you're a kid, you don't think, oh, I know what they're up to. You're not bothered, are you? Do you know? I mean, as long as I've got my tractor, I'm happy. Yeah. So I was. I wasn't changed a bit. But how many women did he have? Was it just him and, like a bunch of women? Yeah. Was it like, what's his name? What's his name? Like Nedwell from Confessions. Confessions of an Older Brother. He liked his women. Seriously. Right. My mum and dad had to move because they got sick of women coming around saying, I've got a kid and it's your marks. They had to move because it got that embarrassed, you know. Did you hear when you were playing on your tractor and there was women running back and forth in underwear, did you ever hear this noise? Did you ever hear that? All kind of. And just see your brother's ass disappearing down the thing being chased by a butcher. Did you? It's not important. Is that what it's going to be like, do you think, when I'm voted number one most eligible bachelor in Great Britain? Yeah. And you coming on your moped. I mean, no. How am I going to get a tractor? CHEERING BREAKS Painkiller Open brackets Summer Rain Clothes Brackets Alex FM 104.9 Ricky Gervais Steve Merchant Carl Pilkington Rockbusters. Is it that time? It is indeed.

Look, Grant, just get on the boat and help us out, will you? That's R as well. And then the last one. If you're going to do that to your drink, I'd let it settle for a bit before you open it. CK. Ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk. Brilliant. Let's have a classic. Let's have a classic from the the Merchant Collection. That's going to be the new single from Eminem Sing for the moment. I like that. 104.9. Ricky Gervais Steve Merchant. Carl Pilkerton. Alright, Carl, all right, what's the matter? Just, you know, what's the matter. What should I explain? If you want. I'm sort of an independent adjudicator and I couldn't help but notice that you both went out to make the tease, but only one of you came back with a wig made out of that poppy stuff that you pack. Bubble wrap. Bubble wrap, yeah. And he didn't want me to do it with cello tape, so I kind of did it with elastic bands that I found. Apparently it hurt his ear. It's cut into his head and. And look at him, he's annoyed. I don't know. There's not many, many times I've ever done, you know, any form of work really, where halfway through it, you know, let's say a two hour live radio show, one of the people has said to the other, can I make out of this big cardboard box a bishop's hat for you? Well, I did that. And then start fashioning that. His eyebrows. So when we went to the kitchen, I kind of did it with elastic bands and that was cutting into his ear or something. I don't know. Making excuses. Oh, Carl, you are here for Ricky Gervais's amusement. I think if you check the small print of your contract. Have you got me? Have you got anything interesting about a monkey or an ape? So we can do chimpanzee that. I know. Something that a lot of other people will know, but I'll. I'll. Well, let's do it then. Chimpanzee. What's it called again? Where should we do a jingle? Well, do little jingle for us then. Oh, chimpanzee that. Brilliant. That's great. So I look forward to that every week. Yeah. And what's going on? Right, it's about this monkey ages ago, don't know where it happened. 17th century, I think it was a chimp got caught having a fag, you know. What do you mean, do I know it? Oh, narrow it down. Loads of chimps are caught with woodbines. So it was sent to court and it was underage. It was, it was. And it got someone to go into the news agent forum. Did they get a bigger gorilla to go? It ended up doing time because it was. It was. Go back a minute, wait a minute. I don't know. That's as much as I know. So there's no point questioning that is. As much as you know, isn't it? Quite literally. Sorry, but why did he go to prison? It's against the Law to have a monkey having a fag in a built up area. What are you talking about? It's against the law for a monkey to have a bag. What if he got it himself? Even if it just. What about if it earned it himself? Just like moving tires around or mucky mucking out the zebras. I don't know the full story. You don't know the full story, do you? Well, do you think you never do? I presume it was a monkey from a zoo, right? Yeah. Do you think it'd be fed up though? Because in a way it's home from home in it. When I read it I didn't think it was that bad because I just. Thought they don't put monkeys in prison. They didn't put the monkey in a prison. They're overcrowded. They haven't got the space. Well, again, I'll find it and give you the like where I got it from. And Chopper Harris was furious because the monkey got the top bunk. Yeah, Can I just. Okay then. Oh, chimpanzee that. Another one next week. Think so. Rockbusters. Right, Can I just recap? Yeah, because actually I have to say you've really stunned people this week. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, either that or they just can't be bothered anymore. Well, they're wrong again. No, no. Right. I think the prizes are so pitiful they can't be asked. Let me just explain it again just in case they don't understand it. It's a cryptic clue, right? And it makes up a band. And the initial that I give you is the initial that the bands that are the artist starts off with. So last week, well, I can't remember but we did, we did AK an exploding pair. Atomic curtain. That explains it so very quickly. Number one. No, last week we did FP that you gave out the clue F D free to pain. Yeah, it was, it was an error. So they're all right this week though, are they? Yeah, the weather stinks. Done it. That's. That's the cryptic clue. And the letter is ridiculous. Number two, that's the rainy smell boys. Right, look Gran, just get on the boat and help us out, will you? That's R as well. And the last one if you guys. That's rigging. Nanny, if you're gonna do that to your drink, I'd let it settle for a bit before you open it. That's CK ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk plus keep your problems and queries coming in for Carl. We've got another one as well. Which I'd like to give you after the next track, Carl, if I may. All right, all right. You've got a problem, haven't you? What was. Oh, yeah. Just listen to this car. Let's play a record. Let's come back with this. It's an amazing problem. Wow, you're getting celebrities asking you questions now, Carl. That's David Bowie. Is there life on Mars Dragon? I reckon there's more going on than just us messing about, I reckon. I hope so. I think tell Steve your problem that you were. You aired to me. Well, you know, like, I'm always thinking about stuff when I'm washing up. I'm just gonna look at Steve for the reaction when this question comes out. Okay. There's been a few things I've been thinking about. Do you know like how I tried to confuse a computer by putting in Y in the search engine? Yeah, along this lines of that. I was thinking in the week, if you put a chameleon on a mirror, what would happen? And also, this is a bit of a bigger issue. We're always making more and more stuff right in the world. You know, big buildings, big planes, big boats and that. Will we ever get to a point where all this is too heavy for the world to handle? Right. What error has he made there, Steve? What physical scientific error as he made there with that question? I can't. I can't begin to explain it, Carl. We're not getting the rocks from other planets. It's already here. It's like having a. It's like having a big pile of books in a room and then moving them over to the other side of the room and build a thing going, oh, can the room take it? I'm building a lot of things out of these books. What about plastic? Where's that come from? Other chemicals that existed on the planet? Do you see? Did you see the point? Hang on a minute, though. What about a little tree you plant? That's an acorn. It grows, Rick. That's bigger. That's more stuff. Yeah, don't listen to him, Carl. He's patronizing acorns and that though, right? They. They take. They grow from minerals and proteins already in our atmosphere or in our. The mass of Earth. What about a cat, Carl? Right, you get it? It's a very tiny kitten, but it grows up and it's bigger. Carl is. She's doing it on purpose. Elephants, they. They're very small to begin with, but they get bigger and bigger and so they get heavier and heavier. Mind you, dinosaurs have gone you know. But, you know, but, you know, that's, you know, famously, that's how Atlantis disappeared, you know. You've heard of the legend of Atlantis? Have you heard of the legend of Atlantis? I think so. This was a. This was a city that existed. It's proven right. And what happened was they just kept buying stuff in mail order. They just kept ordering stuff like the king and stuff. Just kept ordering stuff in mail order. He brought girls across. Carpets. Carpets. He kept going. TV set, big screen TVs and stuff like that. And eventually he bought up all the. Mayor that the wise men didn't want. Yeah. He just. Because he's from like olden times. And he just kept buying stuff. Crazy. Like he was just a shopaholic. Basically mentor. It was. And he was ludicrous. It was like. And. And in the end, it just sunk. It just sunk too heavy and it just sunk. So the earth, the more planes we build, the more trees we let grow. Yeah. From acorns and more than that. What about all the other people that are overeating? There's only. There's a. Yeah, there's a Warriors in this world. I think. I think we've got to kill off endangered species and burn trees. That's the only way the earth can survive. You mental. What are you doing? Okay, look, quick query for you. This is from Jay. He's got a problem here. He says my parents won't let me ditch my studies. He's currently reading modern languages at London University. He wants to follow his dream, but his parents won't let him. Of being a dancer, Carl. Worse than that. He says that they're trying to arrange a marriage to a bunch of minging daughters of people they know from good families. Is. He doesn't know what to do. She's got the arranged marriage coming along. And he's also got, you know, he basically wants to, you know, wants to be a dancer. His parents are forcing him into something more practical. First thing, Right. I don't think the arranged marriage thing is such a bad idea. Okay. Because I think too many people go on looks. Right. And then you soon get bored of that and you find out the person who you're knocking about with, it's actually not your type. Right. Why don't you arrange marriages for people? Well, I'm just saying. Right. So I'd say, Jay, go along with that. I wouldn't worry about it. Okay. I mean, if they're really ugly, then, you know, don't go along with it. But if they're half bad. Yeah. Put up with it. Sure. The dancing. Brilliant. Right? That's that solved. Brilliant. I want to be a dancer. After I did the boxing, right, I joined. Joined a dancing thing just near Man United's ground, right. Called Twiggies along. I wanted to learn some moves. How old were you? Well, it was when Michael Jackson was like pretty big, so about 85, 83, 84, 85 around there. Wanted to do it. When I went, it was short and it become like a warehouse for toilet rolls. So in a way, I wonder what would have happened. Sorry, sorry. How is that an anecdote about you going through dancing? You've told me before. You what? You did boxing for a while. You did dancing for a while. You had true fighting. The boxing. You didn't even get in the. That's not. Imagine if that was a film. This is a boy's dreams of becoming a dancer. Oh, it's shut. Next on. I mean, how is that a story? Yeah, yeah. A brilliant Footloose. All right. I'm fed up. They banned it. Let's go. Eyes shut. Flash dance. First there was a warehouse. Never mind. Yeah. I'm just saying, you know, you'll find something else. I think I got a go kart. After that I bought a motorized go kart and kept myself busy with that. So there's always all those things. Alan Bennett has to sit down and really sweat over his stories. Yeah. He just opens his mouth. You are a living Alan Bennett character. So that's all. Well, Jay, don't worry about that. There's no emotional. There emotional problems I can foresee if you follow that advice. So the advice there is do an arranged marriage. If she's not. If she's not minging, she's not completely minging. Yeah. And don't worry about dancing. Get a go cart. Cheers. Great. Keep your problems coming in. Truth. Rest your head. By gene on XFM 104.9. Richard Ray, Steve Merchant. Carl Pilkington. While I was with Carl in that restaurant, while I was giving him the, you know, the problems, did the old fellow with Viagra and the two fellas making love in the. In the cubicle. We came up with a new idea because he is dumping. Do we need him? As I say, he thinks the scientists have got together. They're never going to wipe out a limpet or a. Or a slug. They. They think they're good, but they're not that good. This is people that are lauded as great minds. And Carl has brought them down. He's taken issue with them like what. He Went, right, great thinkers. And I went, okay. Then Sir Isaac Newton, the father of modern physics, he went, is he the fellow with the apple? I went, yeah. He went there again. See, why do I need to know that the Earth sucks us towards it. Gravity. He said if I was floating around it would be a problem. I'd ask his opinion. I went, what about Einstein? He went again, I've never needed. And this is what he said. I've never needed MC squared in my life. The fellow who invented the video, I'll watch one a day. You know what I mean, though? Give credit where credit's due, right? And I think that a lot of this stuff that was invented, like when we were talking about inventions, you know, I started to look in books and that, finding stuff out, and there was some fella who got a mention on. On an invention site just because he came up with the fishbowl. And it's like, is it that hard? Yeah. Do you know what I mean? It's clearly. Sorry, you're not putting him in the same category as Newton and Einstein, are you? He was on the same list. Einstein was on there. It was saying about him doing that and Newton with the apple and who else was in there? Da Vinci, whatever. He was Leonardo da Vinci. Yeah. Is he the one who did Mona Lisa as well? Yeah, yeah. He said. He said it took him 12 years to paint the lips. I don't think that's that good that it takes that long. I saw, you know, when you think. Saw Tony Hart do like a. An aboriginal man with a elephant in the background. Took about three minutes. Aborigian. An aborigine. Really? An avalanche. So what about some of the big names? What's your first reaction when I say some big names from history? Go on. Gandhi again. What did he do? Good point. Right, Good point. Good point, yeah. All right. Do you understand what he represents? Go on, tell me. And then I'll tell you if he. Deserves to mention his whole kind of attitude towards peaceful protest, you know, it's quite a sort of modern idea, you know. You know, very much the forefather of, you know, the 60s movement, you know, where people would sort of sit in, you know, and protest, you know, Steve, right. Look at the glazed look on his. Did I lose him on Gandhi? Yeah, yeah. So just pick someone else. Do something else. Some of you know about this, obviously. Oh, let's think. A great. A great thinker isn't part kingdom. Bu. Now, Right, Yeah, he's all right. Brilliant. Thanks. What about Jesus Christ? Well, I'm Thinking more your modern day, like your Richard Branson's and that. Like, you know, to be fair, I. Wouldn'T put Branson up there with. With Gandhi, Christ, Newton, Einstein. Why Stephen Hawking? Because he's mainly known for having a beard and a funny jumper. You have to start including. That's Noel Edmunds. Yeah, you're getting confused there. But Branson's a businessman. He's not one of the great sort of, you know, scientific minds, I think, right. In time. Whereas Clive Sinclair in his little car on his way to work. Brilliant. No, but in time, there's certain things, like the apple falling off a tree, Right. Whoever was sat there would have gone, that's a bit odd, do you know? I mean, it's just that they were there first. But to be fair, Christ instigated 2000 years of religion based on his teachings. Richard Branson. To be fair, he did launch Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells. Yeah, they're not quite comparable. It depends what you get impressed by, don't it? Suzanne's always saying, maybe I. Maybe Newton was there. He's coming up with a brilliant theory, like, amazing. He was probably inventing the helicopter, right? The apple hit him in the air and he went, the earth sucking me, the earth's suckling me. You know what I mean? Could have happened. But. So, you know, my girlfriend's always saying, you know what impresses you? Yeah. You know, because you were saying the other day, do you want to go to Egypt? I said, no, not really, no. She goes, but don't you want to see the pyramids? Not interested. It's like, I've seen them on the telly, you know. Sure. Are they going to be that much more amazing when you see him? Good point, good point. How did you ever move out of your street in Manchester? But hang on, no, sorry. I'm interested to know because this is a. This is something that, that he came up with and this is someone that loves him and that he respects. So I'm interested to see what. What was your answer to what impresses you? I don't think I did answer it. I just said, you know the odd. The odd thing you just said, I'm asleep. Little things, little things. Like, I ran home the other night and said, oh, I've just learned something today. She goes, go on. And do you know Lego bricks? Oh, yeah. The name came about because some kid's mum, the kid was messing with the bricks and she said, let go of them and come and have your dinner. Play record. It's got to Be rubbish. It's got to play rubbish. It's always rubbish. They're Scandinavians for a start. Always back in town. Thin Lizzie. What a classic. Beautiful. Carl, should that be our anthem? Me, you and Steve. Eh? Eh? Yeah. Can I just get a bit, a couple of bits of admin out of the way? Go on. We've got an email from Peter Gough. He has said, where is Richard Anderson? Where is Dicky Tunes in to listen to him. Exactly. Where's little Dicky Docker? Little Dicky Anders is not emailed. And if you don't listen. Normally, Anders is our biggest fan. I just. Absolutely. But he's got a little bit of constructive criticism, which we always appreciate. Yeah, yeah, we're open to that. Sure, sure. So if Dickie Andrews is listening, then you might want to get in touch also. Dear Ricky, I've developed a bit of a fetish for the way you say winnersh in your hit sitcom the Office. I'm trying to get my fiance to say it, but he hasn't quite mastered it yet. Anyway, we're getting married in Las Vegas in a couple of weeks time. Could you please say winnersh on air as a sort of wedding present, becoming. One of the most popular requests at weddings. Now, me saying winnershare. So winners. There's a few I didn't get in Thatcham Shinfield. So there's. There's a Woodley. There you are. There you go. That's. That's beautiful. That's keeping them happy. Good luck to them. That's. I did Leopard. I saw one of those stupid email names. If you're gonna email us, at least mention your name because otherwise it makes me sound like a leopard. Original name for a giraffe. Interesting. Thanks for that. Whereas Lego was evented. When a mother had sent someone to get some, though there's no name for them, she went, can you go and get some? There was a gap. He went, oh, yeah, I'm going to get some. Because they weren't called anything. Brought them back, started playing with her and then she went, look, give me those. He went, no. She went, lego, you idiot. Yeah. The actual explanation, various people have emailed us in or phoned in there. The company was set up in 1934, it's a Danish company. Obviously Lego comes from the Danish words leg got, which means play well. And it was later discovered that it was also a Latin phrase that meant I study or I put together. That's the actual. But the thing is, you see, that's where learning's got to be Interesting, because if it even started like that, I'd just go, I'm not interested. I'll be looking for it. Oh, so a fact might be true, but it's just not good enough. It's not interesting enough for you? Not interesting enough. Okay, another quick dilemma for you. So if Newton would have said, apples are attracted to our heads, be careful, they attack you, that would have been interesting. Total bollocks. But you'd have been interested, therefore, in all modern physics. All right, here's another dilemma for you. A quick one from Kate. She says that she's a single woman, she's six foot tall. Recently, she's found herself being approached by men of, let's say, restricted height. And she's not desperate, but is it ever acceptable in her. She wants to know now, is it ever acceptable for a taller lady to go out with a person of restricted growth? What do you think about that? If you see that on the street, do you think it looks bizarre? Do you think it looks odd or. She's a woman with someone of a dwarfish persuasion. Yeah, we can't say sort of that or the midget word, but I mean, a little fella. Yeah. Is that so? There's a noticeable difference in their height. Is that ever a problem? She's six foot, he's three foot four. Yeah. If I saw it, I'd just think she's doing it. Okay, let's not do this now. No, no, no, no. Come on. She's doing it. What? No, for attention, in a way, because there's loads of other things. See, I told you, Steve. Yeah, I know, but I'm just. Just. I mean, is that serious? I think so. Well, I mean, if it makes you. Happy, please don't ask Carl. Do you know what I mean? If it makes her happy, then do it. But in a way, you're not gonna have a normal life. Oh, God, no. But you're not, because they're gonna get staged. There's no point bringing trouble onto yourself, Carl. Does not necessarily reflect the opinions of. Anybody else in the world. Hold on. This woman, she doesn't live in a forest, in a little cottage. Dash. She hasn't got long black hair and wears a sort of. She says the guy she's going out with is a miner in a crystal mine. Yeah. And he just sings all day on his way. He got six mates, apparently, so. Okay. Wasn't it that, Carl? I'm still. Sorry, I wasn't listening. I just was thinking about. Someone just called up and called him dopey. Yeah. Didn't they? I mean, whatever. Do you know what I mean? Why, what's the matter with you? What's the matter with you today? I'm just saying. What, you're fed up with people taking issue with some of the stupid things you say. Lego was invented by a mother going Lego of that. What are we going to do with all the buildings? The earth might collapse. What do you expect people to say? Even our listeners know you're talking rubbish. And some of those aren't allowed to wear socks. I mean, listen, right, last week when I did. Do we need em. Do you know when I called up one of the museums in a science museum? Yeah, he talked to me. Yeah. I'm just saying I wanted to tell you before when the song was on, but you're so busy listening to it. Yeah. Oh God. Oh, was I so busy listening to a song I was playing? Yeah, but we're doing a radio show. Alright, what's your point? Well, I just wanted to say she emailed in to say I got her name wrong. So I'm just apologizing for that. What did you just call her? I think I called her Jessica. What was her name? I don't know. I've got an email somewhere. Well, this is not an apology. You got it wrong again. I even said her real name. How is that an apology? Well, I remember, I read the email. So yeah. Who are you apology to? Apologizing to? Your name's Jackie, I think. Oh, you've got it wrong again, haven't ya? Well, well, anyway, she just said if you, you know, if you want to see dinosaurs and that, go to the museum. You're complaining about that as well, weren't you? You went to a museum and there was too many dinosaurs. You just said, he said you just need four. No. Well, Steve, have you been to the one in Knightsbridge? I think this one that I called up. Right. It's nice. You go in, you get a good collection of stuff. You walk in, there's three or four dinosaurs. You've had enough, right? Go to. I went into New York, right, went to the museum there. Hundreds of them. You can't move for dinosaurs. It's almost like they're responsible for them being extinct. There's loads of them. So all I'm saying is if you want to see a dinosaur, go to the one near Knightsbridge. They've got a nice selection, some old vases and stuff. It's worth going. So do you work for them? Because that was a pretty big sell. You could work that up into Quite an advert, I imagine. Brilliant. Carl, you're fed up on you because you had to get up early. Well, that's another thing. But will we give out the answers for. Let's do that after we've played the next tune. I have to say that I'm wondering if Rockbusters, like Do We Need Em? Is beginning to run its course because this week we've had very, very few right answers. I think you're just getting too complicated. Because his clues and his answers are rubbish. Why don't you start doing proper ones? These are good. We started off easy. I think some of them are a bit tortuous, but they work. Some of them don't work. Come up with some stuff, then let's. Play a tune and we'll come out with the Rockbusters answers in a second. You haven't come up with anything. The Gravediggers 1-800-suicide. It's a good tune, that. I've always enjoyed it. Xfm 104.9. Well, that's nearly it. From Ricky Gervais. That's me, Steve Merchant, one of the. 50 most eligible bachelors in Britain. I hope people as well, if you buy Company magazine, if there's any ladies listening, every week, of course, I've played you a song for the ladies and I hope now that you'll be able to return the favor and maybe vote for me by Company magazine. Vote for me so I become the number one. That wouldn't mean anything then, would it? What do you mean? Well, it wouldn't mean anything then, would it, if they voted you and you got even got into the top 30. It wouldn't mean anything because you've asked them to do it. What are you talking about? Because it means that they care for me enough and then they are impressed and charmed by enough that they've actually made that effort. That's beautiful. I think that would ruin it. Well, you know, let's wait and see what the results are. Do you think. Do you think. What do you. I mean, just, you know, I'm getting off that, you know, because we don't want. Steve uses a platform to get in the top 48. That's bound to. He's bound to be a couple of people. But what do I think of him now, Carl, now you've known him for these many years, what do you think of his looks objectively, now that you've known him, can you remember what you first thought? Like I say, he's changed a bit. He's sorted himself out a Bit? Yeah. Looks a bit better. How was he done? What's he done? I don't know. His hair's better. Yeah. What was it before? It was just a bit nothing. Do you know what I mean? It was like a. Just like if you just let your hair grow and do its own thing. Whereas now it's got a style. Yeah, so it looks good. Glasses. He's changed. His glasses are stylish. Yeah, Just stay sat down. Right, Rock busters. Rock Busters. Some people like tall men. Right, first one. The weather stinks, doesn't it? Yeah. That was R, which was rainbow. Rainbow. Like. Like rain is the weather. And it smells like Bow. Bo. Body odor. So it's Bo. It's Bo. That's pronounced B O. Well, yeah, but you've got a place. It's not pronounced bo and it's not spout. Bow. Who calls it Bo? Everyone knows it's Bo. What, you don't care? You don't care? That doesn't work. Well, they got it. So again, as long as one person. Got it, one person got it. Of all the emails, one person got it. Second one. Look, Gran, just get on the boat, will you, and help us out? Go on. That was R. That was Ronan. Ronan. Right, Ronan. Who's Ronan? Ronan. Who's Ronan? Ronan Keaton. But he's known as Ronan Keaton. No, he's not anymore, though. He's gone on his own. He's just known as Ronan. No, he's not. He's not. He's wearing Keaton. He's always been known as Ronan Keating. All right, so that doesn't work out there. Go on. Third one. If you're gonna do that to your drink, I'd let it settle for a little bit before you open it. That was ck. Shaka Khan. Shake a can if you're gonna Shake you can. This is the worst competition ever. So it's Chaka. Have you got. It's Chaka. It's Chaka. Is Chaka Khan. Sheikha Khan. No Chaka Khan. Wait, you got Chaka Khan. Might have worked to throw a can. Who got all three right, then? Well, well, because basically what happened was people just emailed in three guesses, and the guesses that were right came from Mandy Thompson in Hendon. That's ruined that, frankly. Well, that's. That's run that into the ground. That's. Do we need them ruined? No, we can't just bin everything. That's. I. I don't think we're gonna get that. Oh, they're not as good as they think they are because you're only picked on Newton. I. You don't know anyone else. You don't know who Gandhi is. Chimpanzee that You've. You've run out of. I did like the jingle for that, though. Oh, Chimpanzee that. That was a great jingle. Yeah, but sadly. You want me to use that again? So who's won anyway? Well, it was Mandy Thompson I mentioned, but as I say, she guessed, so. I mean, she can have the prizes, she's welcome to them. But I think we should knock it on the head car. Maybe you should come up with something new. No, I think it's still got a few weeks in it. I think we should take some time off. Well, yeah. What about, like, the foreseeable future? Don't know. That's all for the ladies. Listen, you know what? You know, I think it's maybe the March issue of Company magazine. Buy that. Top 50 most eligible people. It's probably an address or a phone number to call. And here's another song for the ladies, maybe just to charm you further. Tom the Model by Beth Gibbons and Rustin Man. Carl. Say compliance. Say it nicely, like you're happy. See you later. Oh, is that the best you can do?",
