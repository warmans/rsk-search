Two hours of it, right, and all the records. Specifically, what sort of stuff have you planned for us? Because I know you've been. What have you done? Well, you know, I've been busy this week. I've been house hunting, I've various things, but I know you've had the whole week off, right, so what have you been up to? Carl, Tell them what we've got. Tell them what you've, what we've planned. All the stuff you've done, what have you got? But Rick, specifically, what have you come up with? Quick, quick, quick, quick. Cuz people getting bored. Tell us what you. I've come up with the music, right, I've got. Obviously that's, We've already planned that. We planned that last week. So that's all done. But what have you yourself contributed to today's show? I got, I got a, a text message today from Ross Noble. You know Ross Noble, the comedian? Who's on, who's on? I've got news for you, right? He says, ask Carl if he woke up with ladies boobs, would he just put a dress on and live as a lady or would he just be a man but with these boobs? Carl, it's a good question. I know that happened to Ross. He's throwing that one out. It did in a way because he ate pizzas for a year. Yeah, he did, yeah. He got a lovely pair of breasts. Gone. Just find a loose fitting jumper, go to the doctors. What would you say to the doctor? How would you explain this phenomenon to the doctor? So you'd be happy with this because you believe in shite, like. But it can happen because I told you a couple of weeks ago what can happen. You can wake up with breasts if you're a fella. I told you. Go on. Haven't you remembered? No, I, I funny that, innit? Go on. Have you, Steve? No, I don't remember this. Did you tell us on air? Yeah, it can happen. If you go to Argentina and have a steak, you can wake up with breasts because. Because I'm sure I'd have remembered for the other one. Look, he likes that, he likes that. Is that what you've come up with this week? That joke? Yeah, brilliant. Play a record, it's gonna be a dynamite show. Listen, look, we're gonna play, I'm gonna play some classic tunes today. I'm gonna educate the youngsters, Steve. Right. Now, you've all heard of Louie, you've already underground, but you know. Have you heard of Venus in Furs, Carl? Shiny, shiny shiny Boots. Felix in First Underground. What a great start. Classic. They continue to sound fresh and contemporary. Is this. Do you know what that song's about, Carl? No. Ms. M S. It's about M S. You know that? Yeah. You know the shop? Yeah, it's all about that. Yeah. Whiplash smile and all that. All the things you can get at Marks and Spencers. Shiny boots of leather. Yeah. Being whipped. Yeah. I think that's a new division they've opened. Yeah. But we have got a great show lined up. Have we? No. God, we know we have. No, no, because we got Rockbusters coming up. The great news that's made the press. Has it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Frimley Tea Rooms newsletter mentioned it. We've also got Carl's local, isn't it? Yeah, yeah. We've also got Educating Ricky where Carl educates me. I don't. The one last week, a girl, right, she was deaf and she was out of an argument with her mum and she pushed her and she. At her head and then she can hear again. Yeah. Don't know what I learned from that. No, it might be, it might be subliminal. Someone might be going, it might, it might be a metaphor that I will learn from. Yeah, it's like a parable. Yeah. Yeah. So look at this face. We might as well be talking Dutch, might we? Carl, say something quick. It's radio. I don't understand what you want from me. Oh, we're only joking. All right, so Educating Ricky. I've worked a bit harder this week. We've got some good stuff. Okay, I'll give you the, the, the teaser headlines. Headlines in a bit. Yeah. So you've got, you've got Rockbusters. Carl's having a bit of a stressful week because he thinks he's not appreciated because he's, he, he gets in at what time do you get in? About eight or nine, don't you? About. Well, last week. Yeah, I've been busy this week. I've been in at about half past eight in the morning. Yeah. And we've been leaving when? About half past eight, nine o' clock at night. Yeah, yeah, I'm in now. You get paid, don't you? I'm busy at home. A lot of people work late, Carl. A lot of people work 12 hour days. Why are you busy at home, Carl? What are you up to? Because we're trying to sort out a move. Huh. I've been trying to call around this morning to get someone to buy a food on a table from me. Yes, well, we could put that appeal out now, can we? If anyone wants to buy a futon. Or a table, just think a futon that Carl Pilkington slept on. How much you. You asking? Whatever. Well, you need. You've got to take the two. I don't want like different people coming around and that. Sure. Gotta buy futon on a table. It's quite specific, isn't it? Someone has to want a food. Isn'T it? Alarm clock and tea maker. This is futon table. Looking for about 100 quid. And it's good, it's good condition the food on. Yeah, right. You haven't pissed yourself in the. No, no, nothing. And what kind of table? What sort of tables are we talking? Are we talking like a table for a lounge? A dining table? No, for like a computer and just, you know, something. Has he got any drawers? There's no drawers. It's just a nice wooden table. Right, is it. Is it kind of oak? It sort of an IKEA sort of thing? No, it's like oakish. It's okish. Yeah. Okay, so 100 quid. The food one is just. It was just, just a mattress and the, and the, and the, the, the pallets. Yeah, yeah, but it's not. You see, you get cheap futons. This is a good one. It's. How much would that retail for when you purchase? Paid about 250 for it. Right. So it's a bargain. Well, if you look at it, if you. How long have you had it? How old? This is a whole new strategy. Well, I'm thinking everything is legal, I think. I don't think we should use. I'll tell you what I'm interested in, in Rick. It's just. Just finding out a little bit about the sort of thing that Carl's got in his home. You know, I. People will phone up to spend £100 just to go around. No, I won't be. No. What? No, they'll come here, I'll bring it to work and they can pick it up here. I'm bringing a suit on and a table to work. Don't you write a bike? We need someone with a van now. So we need is anyone who wants it. But they're not allowed around your house. Can they meet you next door? Someone with a van? Could they meet you in your street somewhere. Hold on. Could they meet you? What about the little Chinese fellow that lives across the road on the two bouncers and the old woman who's dead reading a book. Could you meet himself? I've got an idea. What about if you meet at the end of your street, you blindfold them like they do when. When terrorists take the negotiator to the hideout. Big cheese. And, and so you could do that. And, and so, you know, they. They could piece together maybe where you live from the sounds and stuff. Yeah, yeah, but what about that, Carl? That's. That's a great idea. Yeah. And would you sign the futon for people, do you think? Would you. Would you give them a little signature or maybe sign. You could sign the palette. Yeah. Or I could try and get work to buy it off me and then we give it away for Rockbusters. Would you do that, do you think? They do. I think probably do it for Foxy with his. With his big. Imagine how big that. Imagine if he wanted to sell his hog. Yeah. That is a motorbike, isn't it? Yeah, yeah. He's been selling his hog for money for years, hasn't he? Oh, dear. So we'll see about that. So if people are interested, maybe email ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk if you're interested. In futon competition. £100, Ono. Yeah, yeah. What gear have we got anyway? I never knew what that meant, Ono. I thought it went sort of on the nose. On the nose, what we got? Well, tell me what we got to give away, Steve. Sorry. Actually, I have to say you've excelled yourself this week. Emerson Ashcroft's single coming up soon after this. Go on. Since when have you taken to talking like that? It does amuse me. Go on. This is actually. This is a nice little collection here. This is a 3 DVD set. David Attenborough's the Life of Birds, Trials of Life and Life in the Freezer. Good one, isn't it? That's a selection of animal based documentaries. Yeah, we've got. Well, absolutely. When he goes off the bow and does like fast cars, this is very, very good indeed. This is a best of David Bowie complex. It is a very good. Not the rubbish ones that no one else wanted. This is a brilliant complexion on there. We've got this now. This looks like a madness. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's far worse than we could possibly have imagined. It seems to be some kind. Is it our house tie in with the our. And it's a cast of 20 people who wanted to be singers. It's tricky to find out. I can't figure out if it's the originals or not. But needless to say, if you're a Madness fan, I'm sure that'd be an. Absolutely. You love that. Now, I know that, Steve, I wouldn't. Mind that DVD collection myself. No, we can't. I'm talking of great compilations. What about this? It's Country Legends I'm seeing on the front there. Glenn Campbell. We've got Dolly Parton. We've got. What should we call it? On the. On the car. What do you call it? From a great performer. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Jake Whatchamacallit. Oh, excellent. Great hits from him. So that's there as well. That's the same XFM compilation again. Easy to get hold of the big one. The big one. The film that Carl picks every week. The DVD movie this week. Don't go out tonight if you've got a DVD player and a television set, because you'll be staying in and watching this fantastic film. It will tear your soul apart. It's Hellraiser. The original Hellraiser. Bear in mind, it has been on Channel four and Channel five and on most cable channels since it came out. But if you haven't seen. If you're one of the only people who has not seen it, of course, you have to be over 18 to play. Then you can win Hellraiser. That is fantastic. Well, play. Play a song. Car. We'll come back to that. More. More great stuff indeed. The competition coming up later. Email only, isn't it, Carl? Yeah, absolutely. Futon. Futon still available. Richard Ashcroft. Check the meaning. Well, Carl, you're chuffed, aren't you? What's happened? What's just happened? Tell the listeners what's up. She sparked you up a bit. Steve's just called up, is putting an offer for the food on and the table. Yeah, I think he wanted to. He definitely wanted it. But I said, look, you know, think about it over the weekend. Yeah, because you're not a hustler. No, well, I'm not. I'm not going to rush him into it because once he's got it, he can't bring it back. I'm not messing about. No. So the bloke said, what sort of wood is it? Carl said, sort of. Sort of like a light brown color. He went, what beach? Colored car went, depends what beach you're on. Which was nice. You do understand there's a wood that's called beach. Well, he's happy he likes the sound of it. Nice plum cover. He's gonna be. Yeah, it's Carl going, I go with Magnolia. He was my. He's just going, I'll tell you what, life looked nice in your spare bedroom. It was like a. Well, he did an episode of Change Rooms. It was like listening to an episode of Carl. He did the deal in under three minutes, wasn't it? He phoned it about halfway through in that song. So you worked pretty quick, Carl. Yeah, it's your Manx galley way. Are you sure we're not allowed to do this though? No, I think it's highly criminal. Have you got anything? Well, I'll tell you, I am moving shortly, so I mean I might, I might come in next week. I can have a couple of things. I threw away a desk the other day. I gotta get rid of a bed, a chair because, you know, I'm pretty tall. This is so pathetic. When I moved up to London, my dad said, well, you want to be careful because I mean the seat sitting in a lot of these London pads. It's bad seeing very low backs. Fashionable, isn't it? Fashionable chairs and stuff. You're a big guy, six foot seven, you need like a decent chair. We went to a shop, it was like a secondhand furniture. I bought this chair very high backed. Solo. I love that. It's just a chair so I could sit in my room and watch tv. But was it a soft chair or is it a wooden chair? It was kind of like a sort of. It was. Well, let me explain because it's kind of like an armchair but it's kind of got wooden arms. So I get this show bring out to London. This is a great chair. This is a wonderful chair. I'm gonna be watching tv, everyone else is in agony by, you know, right. And I. Someone went, they looked at it, they went, isn't that an orthopedic chair? And I looked it again, right. And I realized it's kind of white cleanable. It's made of some kind of fabric that allows you to just mop it down with a wet cloth. Why? Because I think it came from an old people's home. You know when you see like old people in some kind of social room in an old people's home, just sat watching a little everything on tv and they can. You can wipe everything clean. It was. It's one of those chairs. Oh, that's fantastic. So if anyone's. Maybe they've got an elderly relative slipping off. And it's also the most uncomfortable chair because Unless you've got chronic back pain. It's just the most uncomfortable chair. It makes you sit bolt upright, if not slightly forward. You've done a good set on it. I think either the phones are going. Mental if you've had a recent accident or you've got a disabled. Or. Or someone in. In the house who's just elderly, then. Then you might want to get in touch. I'm happy. You can take that off, man. For 25 quid. This is so wrong. 25 quid. I'll take that. Maybe you're setting up an old people's home. You know, it's a little pet project. Yeah. You don't get a lot of grant. I mean, and because though Steve's such a high flyer, I mean, if it really is a good cause, they just give it to you. Let's not rush into anything. Anything really. I like to assess each case. Yeah, certainly. If you are a charity, then. Then I might go for 20 quid. You take off mans for 20 quid, but otherwise 25. And I tell you, because it's in good condition because I haven't really sold quid off. If you really. You know. And there were some stains. I've wiped them clean. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, that's fantastic. So we've. I'll tell you what we should. We should resuscitate next week. Swap shop. The multicolored swap. Honestly, there's a great format, but there's a couple of things I've always wanted to get. My swap shop is one of them and the other one is Superstars. I don't remember Superstars. Superstars was great because it was like the people of their time. So you'd have like people like nowadays. You'd have. You'd have Beckham and what's his name, who's a tennis player. Ruzickki. Yeah. And they have to compete. So all these people have to compete at each other's sports. They have to. 7 out of 10 sports. And there's a leaderboard and there's a big final. Oh. Oh, Keegan came off his bike. No, no, it's real sports, proper sports. It's 100 meters. Tennis, weightlifting, all the real sports. You can't do your own sport. Well, I know you're a pretty big guy now in British tv, you're a bit of a big shot. What do you reckon? Pull some strings. Let's get it back on there. Superstars. Superstars. Sounds fantastic. Me, Johnny Vegas, Peter K. For the bigger fella, I think maybe the comedy. Comedy Superstars. What we got next? We've got a bit of Springsteen, haven't we? Let's play Springsteen. This is a track from his current album, the Rising. A lot of people think Bruce is a bit mor. A bit middle of the road or whatever, but, you know, I just think, piss off. Yeah. I just think, screw you. Yeah, get lost. Yeah. Imagine this, your open top Caddy. Yeah. You're just going around from Route 66. You just. You're going home maybe for Thanksgiving. Yeah. See you, folks. Just turn up the radio if you are. Play the tune. Probably not, though. That just reminded me when I brought a. So stop it for a second. Just realized when I brought a woman back and she saw the orthopedic chair. You bring a woman back to your pad. Oh, it's embarrassing. And the harness. Yeah, the truss. Yeah, yeah. Can you give me those two splints? I'm sorry? Those two splints there. Well, I've got to go. Have you. Is this a potty under the bed? The Rising, title track from Bruce Springsteen's current album. Yeah, it's great. Is that feeling of. It's melancholy and uplifting. We've had quite an interactive show so far because we got a. A call that superstars is coming back. It's due to come back in the BBC schedules, which is great news, apparently. Was Steve Redgrave is one of them, I think. Will professional footballs be allowed to take part these days, though? We're not. 50 grand a week. You can't really have them falling off bikes and their ankleskill last night. Yeah. Celebrity fig Ian McCaskill three times, didn't he. Did you see? No, I haven't seen it. There was a great moment where they had to go into a thing called a bod pod. And you sit in. It looks like space age and it. And it analyzes you and it tells you percentage body fat. Now, I think men are meant to be about sort of 15, 25 body fat. Women are meant to be about 20 to 30 body fat. And all went in there and it went in there and it said in the casket and it came up 34 body fat or whatever, slightly overweight. I'm gonna come to the 38 overweight. Then it went the other one. 45 body obese. Then it went, Jono, did it say. I don't want to tell you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then it went 50, 50, 50 body fat. You know, very obese. Then Rick Waller was sat in there and it came up 60 body fat. And I wanted to come up slug, but it Came up more with a 60. You're 60 fat. So. So 60 of him is fat. Yeah. Yeah. 60 of his entire makeup. That's extraordinary. Well, you know my feelings about. Well, let's go on to. But that's the reason I don't watch the show, actually. I do feel a bit sorry for him. And he's. I think he is trying. Although the fella there thinks he's not trying. So I don't know who to believe. Sure. I don't know. I believe Waller. And he does get pains in that. And he is a bit. The problem is, right, he does like his food. Yeah, we all like our food. But if he didn't do the exercise, it wouldn't be as hungry and he might not get fat. This is a whole new nutritional outlook. Absolutely. So you're saying don't exercise and carry on eating. And that's interesting. No, let me write that one down. I will send that to the British Nutritional Organization. Yeah, no, that's good. Carl Pilkington. Okay, well, I know that's a good. I'm no doctor or anything. Stop being so bloody modest, please. You are a doctor. You're not. You're not a doctor. Seriously, you're not. You didn't qualify. That's interesting. You dropped out earlier. That's mad. That is mad. I mean, you're as good as doctor. You just. You just didn't get the paperwork. Whatever. You just didn't do that for the exam. He was just saying that Bruce springs him. Depressed him a little bit. Yeah. Because it reminds him of when he worked in the supermarket. And so it's funny how can do that. Take you right back there. Yeah. Nothing else can do that. I said, well, actually, smell is the most evocative sense because smell is linked to memory in the brain. And he went, yeah, they probably said that before music, though. And now all signs are going, we better revisit this because there's music. Now. We've had this theory knocking around for, you know, I went to see Bruce. You'll be pleased. Now, I just want the fans of the show to know that I did make it to Bruce Springsteen's concert last week. And he started with that song we just played. And it was dynamite. I mean, he never let up. Almost three hours. He rocked the joint. He's 53. He was sliding across. It was pure rock and roll. Pumping our fist, sliding across the floor on his knees. He was jumping on the piano. It was real Jerry Lee Lewis rock and roll. And it was dynamite. And I just was looking around, though. And when I am the trendiest person at a gig, oh dear. Then I'm in trouble. Do you know what I mean? And there was some of the people there I imagined, you know, on Amazon do, it says like people who bought X also bought Y. Yeah. And I think people who bought tickets for Bruce probably bought tickets for Martinophler. Yeah. Dave Gilmore. Yeah. Without Pink Floyd, but Stevie Nicks. But there's also. Yeah, but then there's also, you know, all the monsters, right. They probably buy stones when they visit, you know. Yeah, yeah. And probably teeny wash jeans. Yeah, yeah. It's the small waistcoats. Yeah. Red denim shirt. Plaid. Plaid shirt. Maybe sort of like Timberlands. Nothing wrong with Timberlands. I'm not. That's libelous. Sure, sure. See, I've done it again. But. So it was hell getting out. I couldn't find. I mean, I went to the tube and it was a nightmare because some of the tubes weren't running. I just said, my friend, I'll stop this, you know. Stormed off trying to find a cab, couldn't find a cab. Wandering around Wembley just livid. I mean, fuming, because I couldn't find a cab. Just. I was screaming because I was going, I've got money, I'm on the radio, I've had a TV show. I've got the cash, I'm willing to spend it. There's no one who can help me get home. And I was. I've seen him shout this in Brewer Street. Yes. To standing the middle gone. And I was thinking to myself, what would you have done there? Because in the end I just sat in a little calf, had something to eat. But you. I mean, if you couldn't get a cab, what would you have done? Just because there's a couple of. I was looking. There's a couple of hotels near Wembley. I was thinking you'd have just checked in. Yeah. And just stayed. Yeah. When there's a cab, let me know. I was thinking, because you were thinking of going, would you have booked a cab beforehand? Yeah. Would you have. Would you have thought to do that? Yeah, I'd have got a cab there and I'd have booked a cab. When the helicopter just took you back home. Yeah. Oh, he's having a dig, isn't he? He's having a laugh, isn't he? Yeah, yeah. Play the ads. Death in Vegas. Scorpio Rising. Featuring the voice of. Is it Noel, Gary, Liam in it. Is it Liam? Sounded a bit like him. Liam. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Excellent. Yeah. Right, okay, let's let's get this show well and truly on the road. We better start educating Ricky. Next car. What have you got for me? I can't wait for learning. I need learning. I need education. We should just explain something. Obviously. For those that have just tuned in, Carl tries to teach Ricky three things. Each week based on the pun title. And, yeah, each of them just to tantalize Ricky is abbreviated into some kind of headline. Involving. Involving a pun. So what have you got for us this week? They are really cryptic this week. Okay. Yeah. First story, little headline is, don't worry about him, he can deliver it. He candle it. Yeah. Sounds a bit like he can handle it, but it's not brilliant. Second one. I'll get a lo. I'm. I'm. Get a loaf of this. Some classics. Who can forget. Get a load of this. Coming soon and stocking a waterman. Go on. Second one. I'm committed to this treatment. I'm committed to this treatment. Yeah, all right. Tantalizing. Yeah. And the last one. The police are causing a bit of a stare. The way he looks when he says it. I wish we could see it. Can't we get Carl on telly? There's got to be a way. With all the cable channels, anyone can get on telly these days. Let's get. Let's phone up. Let's get you on choice or summit. Just a little. Just Carl. What? What. What are you going for? Oh, he can handle it, I think. Don't worry about him. He candle it. He candle it. Okay, let's hear this one. Right. Are you familiar with the. The phrase burning the candle at both ends? Yeah. Do you know it's come about. I know. I mean, it does. I. I assumed that it was to get more light in the room. How would that work? Well, they'd put it sideways and light both wicks. So out of one candle they could get. No, no, go on. What it is. I know it seems it means you're staying, you're doing too much, you're staying up too much, you're not getting enough sleep and you're. Yeah. When they didn't have light bulbs and that. Oh, yeah. What year is this? Literally. Literally ages ago. Specifically. Yeah. Quite a bit back. Okay. Didn't have light bulbs and that. So they used to have candles. When did the light bulb come in? Because I can't remember at the moment. I don't know. Okay, go on. So, yeah, so they've. They've got a light bulb. You're not. What? You wouldn't know. You're a doctor. You're a doctor, you're not a historian. Go on. And people who worked a lot of hours. Yeah. How many? Literally lots to get up early in the morning. Because they have to be up early. Yeah. And it's dark outside. So he'd light the candle. Sure. And he'd wear it out a bit. And then they'd be getting in late as well. Yeah. And like, they'd be like, oh, it's dark, I'll have to light the candle again. And the burning candle at both ends of the day. So that's where the saying comes from, burning the candle at both ends. So. All right, that's. Little lesson. Yeah, Lesson one. Okay. Can I have. No, no, you can't have a rush into them, Rick. You've got to. You've got soak that one in. Any questions for Carl off the back of that? What do you think? So, so. So people were. I mean, basically where this comes from is people literally. Sure. There you go. So we've still got. Go on. I'm committed to this treatment and I can't wait. This is like. This is like Christmas. I've got to open another present now. No, I'm afraid we've got to save it. But, Rick, listen. We often get a lot of email correspondence during the show, Rick, which I don't. I don't sort of pass on to you because, I mean, you're busy, you're planning the show and stuff. You've got a lot of ideas, you've got music and stuff to worry about. So I check the emails and we get a lot of response. A lot of people, obviously, you know, want to give us feedback. Just a sample one from Richard Anderson. He's just emailed us in here, Rick, because he's been listening to the show. He says, ricky, your show is appalling. Are you actually aware you're on the radio or has someone just secretly stuck a microphone on you? That's from Richard Anderson. That's typical of the kind of feedback Rick, we're getting really, today. So it's not good, is it? So that's. That's the kind of. Yeah. High positive praise that we're getting. So I'm down. Anderson's listening because I wanted him. Yeah, no, I mean, I was gunning. For him as a fan. I was worried early on in our career. So I think he's hooked now, though. But thanks, Anders, for getting in touch. Good work. He's sitting through it for Hellraiser, though, isn't he? Yeah, well, that's still to come. Still to come. What we playing mean A bit of old dirty bur. I can't. I can't say the word. It's offensive. Old. Old, is it? Old dirty bollocks. No, no, no, no, no, no. Old dirty old dirty big cock. What is it? What is it? I can't tell you. It's offensive. Breaks up. Brilliant. Yeah, yeah. Funny word, isn't it? What other funny words are there? Although xfm's a funny word. I just say the letters out because the word doesn't make sense. Just. Let me just check Richard Anderson's email again. Just remind myself of. Go on, Ricky. Your show is appalling. Richard Anderson. Thanks. What I like about Dicky Dickie Anders is that he's obviously so angry, he's so annoyed by the show that he's bothered to email just to get the venom out, otherwise you just think you'd switch over. Well, he's obviously so annoyed. He knows how to hurt. Exactly. He's really taking the time out to. Show his disapproval of giving up. I'll tell you what though, it is pretty hard to listen to. What this? Yeah. I've listened back to the tape that when you're making that thing for the best of. Yeah. And I, I mean I sounded like Albert Taplock. I really sounded like some sort of punch drunk stroke victim and. Oh, there you go. I don't remember myself like that. So yeah, I do apologize. It's. It's not a great planned show. Slick word of articulate sentence. Is it? But I mean then who is? But I think there's so many shows that are, you know, nowadays on radio. I think there's a lot of stuff that's heav formatted, you know, and there's with, you know, I don't know, presenters who were professional and got some sort of degree of talent. Yeah. And ability to sort of string a sentence. You know, I'm thinking Chris Miles. Yeah. But I mean I'm bored with those. You know, I think we need a little bit of. A little bit of calm in our life. I'm just thinking, actually, I just suddenly struck me, if you want to get rid of your. Your furniture. Got a buyer. You've already got a buyer. Because if there's any other stuff. What I. We. We were clearing some stuff out of our place recently and we just dumped some stuff outside on the street because we were going to take it to the tip later, just dump some stuff outside and I have never seen so many people come out of the woodwork scavenging through our garbage. It was incred. They were like zombies. Well, that's what I was. They were like flies around. When I said to Carl, that's what. You should just do, just dump out. You'll get taken. When he went, he said, do you think I asked enough 100? I went, yes, definitely. He went, oh, I could ask. I said, no, don't do that. I said, because you'll end up having to pay the council and take it away. Said I wouldn't. He said, I'd rather just dump it and let a little homeless fell have it. And then he went, imagine sitting at the des. Right? I walked past his. Sat outside Hearts, right, the little 24 hour shop. He sat outside there and he goes, have you got any change? And I go, I can do better than that. Yeah, here's a chair and table. Yeah. A futon, no less. Not your boring bed, but a trendy. Yeah, well, but the thing is, I. Amazing the number of people that would stop to look at our junk. What? There was a car driving by with a family and kids. Perfectly respectable. Just driving past, you know, on the way to somewhere. Stopped, got out, got the kids out the car. Come on, kids, let's just look through this chunk. But I like the idea we were going to Alton Towers. Dad, no, no, sorry, no time. We're not going to the zoo. Let's look through this rubbish. We're not going looking for people's rubbish. Put these gloves on, look through this. Ow. That's an E D. It was. I mean, who does that? It was like a Saturday afternoon. Kids were just gonna go and look through some rubbish. And one guy, this is the most incredible. And one guy caught him going through the bins as I came. As I came in, I said, all right, what are you doing? He was one of those homeless guys who likes to remain dignified. Why did you say what are in? Well, because it was my house. I had to go part. I had to squeeze your kitchen. He was in our front garden. Oh, was he? Yeah, going through. He torn the bags open. He was going through it. I said to him, what you up to? He went, oh, yeah, just looking at stuff. Don't, don't worry, I'll just, I'll clean it all up afterwards. Just looking for a few odds and ends. I said, oh, well, you can take what you want, you know, it's all going away. Yeah, thanks very much. Thanks. So we went off. I didn't think anything of it. I was walking past the shops the following days, a little sort of, kind of 7 11. Right. I was walking past, I thought, oh, that's interesting. A Gil Scott Heron album for sale. And I looked, I thought, wait a minute, this is all, all our rubbish. And the guy had set up like a little car boot sale outside the 711 on the pavement. He'd taken adjunct, he'd marked on prices. There's like an old rac book from 1976 that had been lying in the house, a Yellow Pages, you know, and. He'D marked up the other pages. So I'm glad you were. What year was that? 50P. I snapped it up, I thought, that's a bargain. And it was incredible. At the cheek of just selling our junk outside. Enterprise Car. You couldn't you do that? What do you used to do? You didn't used to sell flowers. I sold flowers. I sold soul fizzy drinks at school. Did you? Yeah. What you made, it was Soda Stream. Yeah, yeah, made some. Well, of course, when you were doing your pilkies, making music, your disco. Yeah. He used to go into mum's bedroom and could find a pair of tights and a cigar. Yeah. Like. Yeah, they'd be prizes. Did your dad used to smoke cigars in tights or. Or your mom? Which one of them? He's just gone. Let's, let's. Yeah, we're educating Ricky. No, no, no, that's all teasing that. Rockbusters. Well, I think we should play a tune and come back with Rockbusters. Show's fallen down. If we were going so well and that. It's just the energy, isn't it? The first hour we got through. I'm still in good spirits. Is this still good, is it, this show? Enjoying it? Yeah, yeah, it's still good, is it? I'll just. Let me just check, cuz. Just check what Richard Anderson thinks of it. Good evening. He thinks it's appalling. No, no, the dickster thinks it's appalling. So we should play music. Aqualong, A Rockbusters next. I like that. That's great, isn't it? Good times gonna come. Well, Carl, we've got loads of ideas. We've got emails coming left, right and center. I think you've caused quite a stir. I think you've turned this show around, to be honest. I'm being honestly. Yeah, no, you've done really well. You're actually acting a bit like a producer, isn't he? And you're coming through in your own right. We've had a great suggestion. We've had a great email here, let me just check this this is from Jeff Dunn. He's a big fan of the show and he's just had a genius idea. He's saying you're moving house car. Carl, why don't Ricky and I come round? We can do a live outside broadcast from your flat. We can observe from your kitchen, those weirdos that live opposite. Yeah, we can just maybe just wander around, just see the kind of place that you've got, you know, see, maybe check out your record collection, your clothes, what you got in the bathroom. It'd be amazing. It'd be like Louis Theroux, wouldn't it? We'll be Louis Theroux. Come on, Carl, this is a dynamite idea. Nah. Why? I. I don't want you coming around making a mess on that. Well, they won't make a mess. Take our shoes off. When have I ever made a mess in the studio? Yeah, exactly. Do you know what I mean? We're not going to make a mess. What? What? We're not gonna have anything with us. But what's in it for anyone? Well, it's just a fascinating insight into you. Yeah. But right, when I see that little Chinese kid across the road who's dancing about in his underpants, that's in the evening, Right? He's not going to be doing that on a Saturday, so you'll be disappointed there. Sure. That old woman show us the mood in which he dances. Yeah, we say, little Chinese kid. He's a 35, isn't he? Yeah, well, yeah, you don't. You. Anyway, that. That's beside the point, you know, we'll find our own amusement. No, I don't. I don't. And the. The woman downstairs has got a baby and if we make loads of noise and it's. That gets. We're not going to make noise, are we just gonna have a conversation in your flat, have a cup of tea. Yeah, but if we do an ob, we need to get like a car outside with a big aerial on it and the parking's bad around our way. What do you mean? You have to do a. What do you mean? To do an outside broadcast? Can't they put in an ISDN line just for the day? No, because I'll make a mess of the wall and I won't get me deposit back. Back. We'll leave that. Thanks for the idea. You know, he's going around painting all the little holes. Well, to get his deposit back in the wall. He wants to get his deposit back. He's probably costing about 400 quid redecorating. Let's remind people, Carl, of the. The prizes for Rockbusters this week. It's dynamite stuff. We've got the David Attenborough DVD nature collection. We've got a number of CDs. The best of David Bowie. We've got a Madness CD. Not quite sure whether that song's from the musical or. Or their original tunes. Country legends. Two CDs there of great country music and the remix to XFM compilation. Plus of course, the big movie prize this week, Hellraiser. Hellraiser. If you haven't seen it already, then I assume you have never seen a film before because I don't know if there's anyone who hasn't seen Hellraiser, but obviously you have to be above 18 to join. How long would you want to be around for All. Is this just for the. Just for the show? Couple of hours. Two hours. Did you get the desk in there? A live ob. We could check out the futon. We could sing it the F. Right, yeah. Oh, you might have sold that by. We could have someone come around and buy it live on air. Yeah, yeah. Think about it, think about it, think about it. It's great. How did Graceland start? That was his normal house and then he took over. Right. Anyway. Rockbusters. Yeah, go ahead. I give a cryptic clip. Blue. Yeah. And. And a letter and it makes up a band. He never said the word cryptic a few months ago. I love it, you know, I mean, I feel it's like our own little Eliza do. Little. Yes. Right. Even Richard will like this one. Here we go then. First one, there's three of them. And you email in. If this doesn't turn Dicky round, nothing will. This is an email only competition. Email only. Right, here's the first one. Initial is B. So it's a band starting with B. Okay. And the cryptic clue is. I don't like them birds. They shouldn't be allowed in this area. I don't like them birds. They shouldn't be allowed in this area. Next one. Right, the next one. He doesn't like women yet. He's got a couple of kids. That's a bit weird. Is that a cryptic clue or is that just. Is that just. That's the cryptic clue. Okay. And the initials there are pd. Okay. And the last one that I've got that one. That's terrible. That's terrible. Okay, quickly. Oh, God. And the last one is that bloke who does. Come on. It's making me laugh. Come on, Carl, be professional. Right, the last one. Right. I can't do it. It's making me laugh. Oh come, I'll come and read them. No, no, come on. Here we go. They don't do this on Blockbusters on tv, do they? No. Come on. Right, that bloke who does sport on telly, he's got a little kid, right? Initials D.C. what? Is that the clue? I'm clearly confused by that. Is that the clue? Yeah. That bloke who does sport on telly. Yeah, he's got a little kid. Initials D.C. okay. Is that a band or an artist? It's a well known sandwich. Is it? What is it? Is it a band or an artist? So just quickly recap. Come on, Carl. Right, come on, come on. Quick, quick recap. The first one is B. I don't think them birds should be around in this area. Right, That's B. Right. Second one, he doesn't like women yet he's got a few kids. It's a bit weird. That's pd. And the final one, that bloke who does sport on the telly, he's got a little kid. All right, DC. All right. And it's ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk if you want to enter for a hellraiser. Oh, I'll tell you what, continue to do a little thing me of like some old stuff people haven't heard of. If you're under 30, probably never heard of this band. It's also a new thing I want to introduce to it. It's. It's show up Canfield. Campil talks the talk, he doesn't walk the walk. He doesn't play some rock classics on his show cuz he's scared. I'm going to play the tracks that Camp was too scared to play. This is Kansas and carry on your way with son. All right Kansas. Carry on your wayward sun. Raw Nirvana. Amazing. We're just talking. We're getting excited about that. Yeah, we've got an incredible and growl drumming. It's brilliant. You know you're right. New one from Nirvana. Well, it's time for educating Ricky part two, isn't it? I'm excited, Carl. I'm going to learn so much from this. What's the choice again? You've got left? Still, still keep throwing in your answers to email. Email, sorry, yeah, the answers to Rockbusters. Yeah. Right, okay. Educating Ricky part two. Right. I'm committed to this treatment. Yeah. Is I've gotta go for that one. Yeah, yeah. Or the other one is the police are causing a bit of a stare. He still says it like it's the best thing he's ever come up with. Which, the way it is, it could be. Right, go on in. I'm committed to this trick statement. Right. Do you know the saying? Is it just sayings now? Are they all sayings? No, no, no, no, they're not. Okay. The other one isn't frog in your throat. The saying, there's a frog in your throat. Yeah. I assume it's when you croak a little bit, you sound like a frog. No. All right, Might seem a bit weird, this one. Right. But years ago. Oh, yeah. So what is that clue committed to this treatment statement? It's about frogs. Kermitted. Probably works better with a K and an ER written down. Well, also, if you'd pronounced it Kermitted. Yeah, but not committed. I'm committed to this treatment. Right, go on, then. That's genius. So, yeah, but what you get, you go to the doctors and you go with throat hurting a bit. Right. And what they did ages ago. Ago. Ages ago. What year was this, approximately? We are going back quite a bit with this one. Okay, go on. And the doctor would say, did history imagine years ago? Go on. And the doctor would say, right, keep. You keep your mouth open. I need to look at your tonsils. And the jaw would ache a bit because. Because they weren't as quick back then, because they didn't have the technology and stuff. And they'd have to, like, stare at it and study it and stuff and like to get an achy jaw. Right. Keeping their mouth open. Yeah, like you get, you know. Yeah. So they'd sat there and these toys closed the mouth and it used to annoy the doctor. Right. So what they did, they used to get a toad. Right. And put it in the mouth. Rubbish. Okay, keep talking, keep talking. And that way they couldn't close the mouth because either they'd squash it. Right. Or apparently you're not allowed to lick a toad's back. So the doctor would have them for breaking the law. No, no, no, no. But it's poisonous. All right, A toad's back. You should never lick a toad's back. Or put it in your mouth. Really, just stop. Can I just ask one question? Go on. Yeah, just ask one question. I've got a few, but go on. Sure. My initial thought is it sounds like a brilliant bit of sort of medical. Medical knowledge there. It's a great idea. Yeah. My only thought is, how does the doctor see past the toad? Yeah. What's he actually looking at with a mouth open? Surely the toad is. Is it not flipping around in the way. It didn't say. Sorry. My question, my first question is, was this on the Internet? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, Carl, that is bollocks. That is. I mean. Well, all right then, let's turn this round. Where does the saying, you got a frog in your throat come from? Probably because you sound a bit. Croak. Probably that. Probably because you sound a little bit like a frog when you've got a sore throat. Carl, did you not question it just for a moment when you read it just for a second? Didn't you think that seems an odd approach? Firstly, why a frog of all the different. Because he's poisonous. It's poisonous. So it's a toad as well. Yeah, well, that. It worked. I'm committed. Worked. I was going to change it to have you heard the news? Toad that. But I went, I went with the flood go. Oh, God. Right, so. So that's rubbish. So that's rubbish. Next, could I have. Let's play a tune. Let's come up with a. Oh, can I just say. No, just play it. Just play it. Yeah. Yo, Carl. I have to thank my mate Dave, who sent me an incredible four disc compilation. That was one of the tunes on there. It looks professional. It's amazing. It's incredible effort. Oh, he's gone to too much effort. Ben Queller. It's a track called In Other Words from his album Sha Sha. Open wide. Oh, dear, that's interesting. Oh, you've actually got a frog in your throat. I didn't get there. I put it in there. That's the most ludicrous story I've ever heard. Carl, why don't you think when you read these things. I think there's always going to be a bit of truth in all of these. And I mean, that fella called up, didn't he, and said, he said, I'm not sure about the, you know, putting a frog in your throat if you got, you know, problems with your tonsils or whatever. But he said years ago, if someone had toothache. Yeah. They'd get hold of a frog and strap it to the face. Yeah, sure. So maybe down the line, you know, maybe they did. Maybe Caligula made his emperor a horse and emperor as well. But I mean, you know, it doesn't go on. Dick Anderson's been back in touch. Excellent. I think so. He's obviously we've turned him around. He loves it. He's been tuning and he loves it now. He says, ricky, thanks for a really forgettable two hours of radio. I think I'LL spend the time next week counting my feet. That's from Richard Anderson. So we've turned him around. No, the phrase counting my feet comes from. Well, in the olden days. Right. I'm talking ages ago when you really loved something. Yeah. You used as a. As a sign of respect, like, say, a radio show, you'd count your feet and that's where that comes from. Well, what about the. The frog thing with a poisonous back? It's rubbish. That's true. No, the toad toes have the secretions in there. They didn't put it in people's mouths. No. So. Well, I'll tell you why. When a. A badger or a heron takes the toad, it's horrible. The toad might die, but it. It's for the good of the species, because then think how many toads, like, looking like that heron could eat in its lifetime. So the fact that one toad sacrifice of all those other toads in that heron's manner. Why. I mean, you know, we've talked about animals a lot on the show. Right? Yeah. And when God made a toad. Sure. Right. Okay, well, I'll stop you there. I'm gonna stop you there straight away. Don't just let him carry on. Right, okay. Like, there's annoying things out there, you know, Jellyfish is a big problem with me. I don't understand why. What they do in the sea and Stu. Right, right. But we'll leave them. We won't. We won't talk about jellyfish with the toad. Right. If it's to protect itself. Yeah. Right. Now it's to protect his species. Yeah. But that surely. Right. If. If the toad had a choice. If God said, right, what I'm going to do for you here, you can have something like a lobster's got claws, big claws to have a fight. Or I can give you something that if someone's having a go at you, you've got to try and persuade them to lick you back. As. As a defense. Yeah. What use is. Right. Oh, gods. Well, I'll tell you why. What is God. The fact that there are still toads around is a testament to that defense working. That's all I'm gonna say. Okay. If the toad had died out, you'd have a point. But they're still around. It works. All right. And don't start slagging God off. He's got a lot on his plate. I mean, basically, I think he took on too much. Particularly in one week. Exactly. It was craz. Danger. High voltage electric 6 XFM 104.9. I'm making Gervais with me. Steve Merchant. Carl's getting all flustered because I put elastic band around his head. And we've had a definition of. Well, hang on a second because there's an update to that. Go on. We did just have one definition here of a frog in the throat. Apparently this has come from some Internet site, so who knows how convincing it is. But it says frog in the throat, meaning suffering from temporary hoarseness, needing to clear the throat. Throat origin from the Old English frogger, meaning hoarseness. That's from Chris. Now that sounds slightly suspect to me, but frogger. I mean, it seems odd that it would derive from that when it so clearly appears to be. You sound like a frog when you, when you have a sore throat. Yeah, but, but, but the word frog could come from frog because it sounds like it's. Wasn't frog a game you could play on the setup? But listen, hang on, there's an update to that because. Just frog, of course. Rana temporara. That's the Latin name. Well, your toad is buffo. Buffo. You may be trying to show off, but I think you're about to embarrass yourself as well because you've been slagging off young Carl. It says here another email. It doesn't tell us who it's from, although it's hard to believe. Now, at one time, medieval physicians believe that the secretions of a frog could cure a cough if they were coated on the throat of the patient. That in itself sounds repulsive, but what makes the idea even worse is the application of the secretions. Instead of painting the treatment on something which may also have seemed rational, a live frog was placed into the the mouth of the sufferer, where it remained until the physician decided that the treatment was complete. Apparently Shakespeare's son in law. That's a question mark. I don't know what that means. Anyway, it's no wonder that today a froggy or croaky attempt at speech is said to be a frog in your throat. So you can see that what's happened there is Carl's misread or been slightly misinformed about a medieval practice. In a sense, you're both winners just for taking part. What's your final one, Carl? The final story is the police are causing a bit of a stare. I can't wait. It's about this fella. I think it's in England somewhere. Yeah. Don't know when it happened, but literally ages ago or. Basically. Well, it's when. I think it's when they Were trying to crack down on, like, drunken people walking about in the street. Oh, yeah. And they found this fella and found this fella and all the local people were saying, oh, look at him wandering around, he's drunk and whatever have you. That's not right. Get the police in. He got arrested and that, and he got him in the court and the judge was there and he says, so, you know, what's all this? What's going on? What are you doing wandering about when you've had a drink? You know the rules. You shouldn't be doing that. You had a glazed expression on your face. Blah, blah, blah. What do you have to say for yourself? He only. He only had a glass eye. So you have two glass eyes? No, he had one, but that was the. Either we're about to sort of lock him up. Was he a bit pissed up as well? Well, he was. He was pretty livid. But was he also drunk with a glass eye? No, no, that's the weird thing. He wasn't even. He hadn't even had a drink. So I just thought. Because he had a weird stuff. Because his eyes were all glazed. Yeah. Where'd you get this from? Why are you telling me this? Why are you telling me this? I don't. I don't. I mean, thank you. Because it's, you know, killed a couple of minutes, but why is this educating me? What are you telling me here? That there's a bit of a thing there, a bit of a fable that don't always judge a book by its cover. Yeah. So the guy. He hadn't even had a drink. He'd probably just been shopping. Yeah. Walking down the street and everyone's, like, getting involved. Like, what's he doing? Hang on, I don't understand. He's walking down the street, happens to have a glass eye. He was doing nothing else to suggest he was drunk. You don't pick people up just because their eye looks like. But even if it happened, why are you telling me? Me, with no. With no particular detail. I know this. But they were going to get enough information. I know. Yeah. No, there's a bit of a lesson there, Educating Ricky. Just, you know, just watch what you say. Don't always jump to conclusions. The only education I could take from that is that if I ever do become a policeman, I shouldn't just arrest people because they look a bit drunk. I should just tap their eye with a pen and goes on you go. Yeah. Guys, can I just stop there? I'm just going to email Richard Anderson and tell him I. Greek. Right, listen. Running out of time. And then. Where did the phrase frog in the throat come from? We've got. We've got it here. It's been. It's been told. Can we play a tune and come back with that? Have we got anything lined up? Yeah, we've got the song with the story in it. Come on, Carl, let's do something quick. Play a record song with a story in it. Never mind that. Just. They're listening. We. This. We discussed this off air. Come on, play a record. It's a song with a good story in it. You got to listen to the words. Carl, what was that? That was your little song with the story. That's another little feature that we do every Saturday. So make sure you tune in. It's a. It's a song that's got a good story in it. There's a lot of music about these. What's that story about them? What's that story about? You don't know what they're going on about. Whereas that classic from the Kinks called Lola. Yeah, what's it about? I'd listened to it for the first time properly this morning. Yeah. And what I've worked out from it is there's a fellow who goes out for a normal Saturday night out. He's in Soho. Yeah. He's having a. He's having a Coca Cola or whatever. And he sees. He sees this woman. He can see. Oh, she's all right. Mind a bit of that. So he wanders over and he sort of gets talking to. He looks at. And he's got a great figure, nice face and all that lovely knob. And. And she speaks and he goes, oh, God. Got a bit of a blue frog voice. Got a bit of a voice like a bloke. But he thought. But, you know, that's her only down point. Sure. So he dances around with her and I think he sits on his knee. I think he said. Anyway, it turns out it's a fella. Yeah, right. A sobering lesson. Yeah. What do you take from that? Look away, sort of. If you think you might be talking to. Just look at it. Sort of Adam's apple. Probably have a hairier ass than a woman. Yeah. I think you've gone too far then, though. I think you've already. I think you're. You're already getting too close. It's a bit late to pull out. No pun intended. Definitely was a pun intended. Was it? All right, was it? Yes. All right. All right. Okay, we. Don't be disgusting, then. Right. Okay. Right. The. The results of. We Ain't Got a Winner for the first time. Yes, we have. We got loads of winners. No, we haven't. We've done this feature for three weeks. Weeks. This is the first time I've. I've managed to sort of. Well, let's go through them. What have they got wrong? The first one. Well, hang on, let's just. Let's do them in reverse order, firstly. So what's. What's the last one? The last one, the clue was that bloke does the sport on the telly and he's got a little kid. What's that? That's Destiny's Child. Des, who does ITV sport. He's got a tiny child. Right. No, that's fine. They got that. The second one was he doesn't like women. Yeah, he's got a couple of kids. That's a bit weird. Yeah, right. That was pd. That was Puff Daddy. That is offensive. Go on. It's not Puff Daddy. It's Puff Daddy. And he's not even called that anymore. He's called P. Diddy. Wow. Okay, fair enough. But they got that one. Yeah. Yeah. And if so, if I'm being tight, these lot are as well. Yep. Yeah. Type means being Summit in Manchester. Go on. Right. And the first. The first one that they're having problems with. I don't think them birds should be allowed in this area. It's not. It's not Boyzone. What's the clue again? I don't think them birds should be allowed in this area. That is perfect. A boy zone. No birds. No women. No women. Yeah, birds. Right. A boy zone. Sorry, Carl, if that isn't the answer. Their clue is better than yours. That is brilliant. What was your boy zone? It works perfectly. What's your answer then? Bangles. I have no idea what that means. Like seagulls. So you don't want them in this area, so you're banning them. Bangles. Well, give it to Boy Zone because Boyzone's better. I think we should have a rollover. Carl, beat them. Carl beat them. You have to use his logic. Sure, but theirs works. You can't do. What am I thinking? No, that's not what I'm thinking. It perfectly. It works perfectly. I think you've got to give it to the ones that got the. The Foy Zone. Well, how about. Right, because they didn't actually get into my. My head that I'm. Heaven forbid. How about we just keep back the David Attenborough and they can have. I'll chuck in the L Razor. Right. Okay. And Blondie album and the Madness. Yeah. Okay. Pick a winner at random. Pick a winner, Steve. I'm going to give it to Paul Slowman, who got those answers. And he also says, P.S. car. You're a. So giving that to Paul and good luck to him. He's got a crazy night tonight. If we can rush these over to him, he's got a cracking Saturday night. Well.

Instead of painting the treatment on something which may also have seemed rational, a live frog was placed into the the mouth of the sufferer, where it remained until the physician decided that the treatment was complete. Apparently Shakespeare's son in law. That's a question mark. I don't know what that means. Anyway, it's no wonder that today a froggy or croaky attempt at speech is said to be a frog in your throat. So you can see that what's happened there is Carl's misread or been slightly misinformed about a medieval practice. In a sense, you're both winners just for taking part. What's your final one, Carl?",
