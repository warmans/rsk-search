Now, for those who don't know, the Sony Awards are like the. The Oscars for. For radio presenters and producers and everything, right? So. And as you know, me and Steve, we love to win. We want to win this one. This is the last time the panel will be listening. So I want a good. A good, clean, tight show, right? So no, no swearing, Jo, no swearing. Nothing controversial and. And nothing in bad taste, all right, this. Good luck out there. Aren't we a little bit buggered, then? Well, yeah, yeah. So, all right, Carl? Yeah, that's all right. Just. It's just when you say things like, you know, make it a good one, sometimes it sort of puts a bit of pressure on and things slip out that you shouldn't say and stuff like that. You know what I mean? Have you ever had that? What, when you can't. It's like, I'll tell you. I'll tell you one story, right? I'll tell you a couple, actually. One's just come to mind right now, right? There was a fella who. Who my dad was gonna meet. I don't know if I told you this before, right, but I have told you when. When it was a party and everyone was saying, dave's coming, he looks like Ken Dodd. But don't say anything. Have I told you? Yeah, yeah, go on, what is it again? And everyone's like, right, oh. And my dad's like, oh, I've never met him. I wonder if he does look like Ken Dodd. And everyone's saying, yeah, but don't say anything, yeah, because you'll accidentally, you know, say it and yumbunctious. You might go, yumbunctious to meet you. So the thing is, when this fella turns up, he did look like Ken. Me dad couldn't believe it. First thing he said, nice to meet you, Ken. His name's Dave. And that's the sort of thing. There was another one, right, at the station that I worked at in. In Manchester, right? There was this girl who worked in the newsroom, right, and she had a plastic arm, right, and this presenter, nice bloke, he didn't, you know, he's not out to hurt anyone. Went up to her, sat down, was chatting for a bit, touched the arm, said, what lovely skin you've got. What does she say? I mean, she's probably used to it. So she wasn't bothered. And then, right, this one, this is brilliant. This is a sort of gaff he made on air, right? Like I say, he's a nice bloke, so he meant nothing by it, right? But he does this competition on the air, gets a caller on, right? And he's talking to the woman saying, you know, thanks for calling in and to play. I don't know what have I Got in I pocket or whatever they used to play on the show, right? And talking to the woman in the background, there's this noise, right, Like. Like that, right? So he's talking and he goes. Have. You got a pet parrot? She said, no, it's my down syndrome kid. Oh, dear. Oh. The thing is, awards don't matter. No, I don't think so. Play record so we're not out to offend or Ann. And it. Appropriate words there, that's the Smiths and Panic. Don't worry about it, Carl. People know that there's. You haven't got a malicious bone in your body so that they know it's confusion. Don't worry. No, it did happen, so. I know, I know. Yeah. So what you been doing this week, Steve? Well, I'll tell you what, at the beginning of the week, I was incredibly annoyed by Carl. Why? No, well, no, because you. I remember you had a little discussion with Carl a while back saying that you thought he was lazy at times and, you know, you had various criticisms of his work. And I got a call from him, he said, oh, yeah, I should have told you. I had a phone call. Someone said that they were trying to get hold of Steve Merchant to offer him some lucrative voiceover work. Now, you know, that is money for old group. That's about. You're in there for about 20 minutes and it's thousands of pounds. There are children listening who are still at school. They should definitely. When the careers guy says, what you want to do, try and get voiceover, just become a voiceover artist. It's money for old rope. Yeah. So I can't believe my luck because, you know, I love money for old rope. Yeah. And I said, well, what's the information? He said, oh, I don't know. I deleted the message. It was on his answer when he deleted the message. I said, right, when did the message come? He said, last week. So he took a week to tell me that he had deleted the message. Why? Just because it wasn't for you. I mean, I don't know how selfish that is, Carl. No, what happened is. Right I got back a holiday. I was at home. Yeah. So I called up my voicemail. Right. Because I can do that. Yeah. Remote access. Right. Because I know what's going on at work. Called in. It was still my day off. I was going through the messages. Yes. Heard one from some company saying, we're after Steve Merchant. Yeah. We want him to do some voiceover work. Yeah. Right. I can't remember the name of it, but I thought, right, I'll remember to tell Steve. A week later, it doesn't matter, does it? You still got the message and they. Yeah, but voiceovers have to be done in the next couple days. I didn't get the message. I got. All I got was there was a company, I don't remember the name, and they phoned you. The white voiceover. How does that help me? There are hundreds of thousands of media companies. You didn't take down a number, you didn't take down a name, nothing. I was more puzzled why they'd want you to voice anything. He's having a go. I don't know why. I don't. But listen to that voice. You must be annoyed. You must be annoyed. I mean, talk about rubbing salt into the wound. I will listen to you. Oh, God. I don't know what you. I don't know how you think. I don't know how your mind works. Well, I was thinking there must be a tractor sale on somewhere. What do I care? Hang on a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I don't care if they wanted me to advertise the latest designs in pirate fashion. We. I will do a voiceover because it's money fraud. Rope. I don't care what you think of my voice. Someone was interested. They were offering me money. And you decided arbitrarily. Oh, they probably weren't wanting. They probably made a mistake. They wouldn't like the way he talks. Anyway, I'll delete the message. No, the thing is, right, what if I get a girl? I get paid to sit here on a Saturday, right, play CDs and that, help out the show, get you decent prizes. I think I do me bit. Sure. Right. It isn't about running your voiceover work. So, hang on. So, Carl, let me just get this right. If someone was ever to phone me, right, trying to get in touch with you, to offer you work, you'd want me to just ignore the message. That is what you're saying to me. You'd prefer that I deleted the message? I ignored it altogether. That's what you'd want for me. To do. That's what you want me to do. What? Someone's calling you for someone's phone. Me? They say. Oh, I can't. I don't know. I'm a friend of a friend. I've got your number, Steve. I would love to use Carl Pilkington for an equal sign that happened. I'm saying in the future, if it was to occur. If it was to occur. Do you want me to just ignore it? Is that what you prefer me to do? Well, it's not like that, though. I did tell you. I told you the message. You didn't. What? You told me a week later with none of the information I needed. Carl, that doctor called last week. That kidney's ready for that little girl that you were doing that sponsored walk for. I forgot to tell you. Herbs are still alright. They keep it on ice, don't they? I think they do. Selfish, Carl. So selfish. And you've lost us a second. Beautiful bit of snoop on xfm. Yeah. Kicking it with. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sweet, sweet, sweet Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. What has happened to Carl? Because Carl, I thought is, you know, is this sort of sweet little buffoon, almost childlike in his. His ways, you know, I mean, like Charlie Brown after some sort of head injury. And now he's. And now he's coming back like that, having a go at not. Not caring about voiceover work. It's like just heat. Have written about him a couple of weeks. It's like he thinks he's better than you in some way. I do care though. You're out of order saying that. Right. Sorted you out with tickets for stuff. Carl's tearing up too. Carl, I received a phone call. You deleted the message offering me voiceover work. You're as bad as my agent. I don't. I'm appalled by it. And I thought we were friends. Ah, at least his agent, when he does it, is losing himself money as well. Yeah, exactly. You've got no comeback. You're still sweet. And to have a go is you. You've got a mank wine, right? Like a cartoon Gallagher brother on Coronation Street. I mean, and Steve's. I mean, yes, Steve does sound like a Wurzel, but that doesn't. You know what I mean? What about Jethro? Jethro does. Well, Jethro gets on Des o' Connor anytime he wants. Just has to phone Des up and. He'S on there and he's whining like a Worzel as well. So, you know, to say that is a rubbish. Alright. Apart from that, then what else have I done that's wound you up? Well, that's, that's, that's a, that's a good starting point because you haven't even apologised. No, it's a shock because that's the first time I've let you down and I didn't really let you down because I passed on the message. You didn't. Well, we've been through it. You didn't pass on the message. Saying I deleted a message for you is not passing on the message. I mean, I just think what's happened is that you've got a little bit of celebrity now from the show. I mean, I've seen you being recognized in pubs and stuff or people have come up and they said, are you Carl? Da, da. Because they've seen Ricky now. It just seems to me that you are not keeping yourself grounded. You are just. You cannot deal with fame, you've not got the intelligence to cope with the celebrity and you're just becoming this kind of ego driven monster. Now it's getting, now it's getting. It scares me. Carl. You're not the man I remember. I put a lot of work into. This isn't even a proper job. Right, where were you in the week? Oh, yeah, he's got you there. What? Where were you in the week? I said, I said, let's meet up, let's, you know, come up with some new features and that. Where were you, Carl? You phoned me about an hour before you wanted to meet. That is not what I would call. I mean that, that is arrogance right there. That's the way I work. That's arrogance right there. That's ego right there. He couldn't, he couldn't get. When I came in, he said, where's Steve? I said, steve can't make it. I had to tell him why Steve was staying in to tidy up because his landlady was coming. This, this. He couldn't get over. He could not get over that. You couldn't make it because you had to stay with your landlady. Is. He talked about it for about the hour when we were working. What are you talking? Last week I had a bad throat. You wouldn't tolerate that. When you had a bad throat, where were you? Why couldn't we do any work then? Because you're at home with your mum and your dad. You were on holiday, weren't you? Why didn't you get your mum and your dad to clean the flat? Oh, he's done it again. He's done you again, mate. Play a record. What's he done me. What? They live in Bristol. Yeah, yeah, the joke's on you. He couldn't get him to clean the flat. Ah, I don't know. Who's laughing at who then? All right, listen, can we just go. Back to laughing at Carl, okay? Because I know where we stand there, Kyle, right? That's the natural order of things. I know. Yeah. He stepped out of the pecking order. Right, well, someone who I don't let down. Right. For the listeners of this show, do you want to read out the prizes for Rockbusters? We'll get that one. Oh, we're not doing Rockbusters again, are we? Yeah, well, it was a shambles last week. We. We cancelled it two weeks ago. What? It just. I mean, there you are right there, Rick. I mean, both you and I, and let's be honest, we're the guys with the. With our names on the poster. I. Supposed to be your show and our faces. Exactly. And yet we have to have. We have to be on tube stations, people laughing at us. Yeah, well, they're not laughing at me. Really. What do you think people think of the poster, Carl? Seriously. I don't want to know his opinion. It's just gonna be insulting. He was looking at you. My point is this, Rick. We used to be able to decide what the content of this show was. Now it's him. It's just him. He wants to do Rockbusters, he gets to do it. I know, and it's. It's awful. Tourette's, Trent Darby. Not only is that offensive, it doesn't. Work as a clue saying that. Have you come up with anything for this week? What's the prices? I'll read out the prices. We've got a brand new XFM stylish XFM DJ bag that is actually quite nice. Yeah. We've got in there a 12 inch from the XFM remix album. This has got the Cure on there and the Prodigy remixes from them, which is quite handy. We've got a little mouse map there with the XFM logo on. And here's what everyone's waiting for. The CDs and DVDs once again, the X list. This is the compilation that X. It's actually very good. Smash Hits, the Reunion. Let me see what we got on there. Aha. Obviously, Wham, Duran Duran, all your favorite 80s and 90s classics. Another copy of DVD. Steve Coogan's Coogan's Run DVD. What else is this here? Low Fidelity All Stars. That's Some. There's Voodoo House and Ghost Funk on there, Rick. I'm sure that'd be right up your street. And also on dvd, man. Is that with or without Wrecked Train? So, yeah, not. Not a bad little selection there, Carl. Yeah, you've done well there. So go on and do the clues then. Let's do Rockbusters. Now I'll bung a song on and where. I love the fact that he was taking the piss out of your voice. I'll bung a song on. Hey, Tribe and Cartwheel tonight is now as griddling as gravy. To be honest, Carl, let's be honest. If Ricky Gervais can get voiceover work. Do you know what I mean? There's gotta be a place for me. Where do you think the place for him is? Well, look, right, you were talking about your face on the poster. It's not all bad because I read something last night that can help you out, right? And it's amazing. So we're talking about that flare record. Go. Warren's Evon. Ain't that pretty at all. On 104.9, I'm Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilton. Right, Carl, Calm now. The son is. They're listening. We've got to win this award. We're just bickering, right? What. What's this thing that can help Steve out? What are you talking about? No, no, we'll talk about that in a bit. What we doing now? We'll do. We'll do Rockbusters. Get that up and running. Yes, sir. Got the email. Busy. Thank you, sir. Yeah. Okay, go on in. Right, so you know, it works. Cryptic clues, initials. Wow. As I said, every week, they're not. They're not strictly cryptic. It's more. What am I thinking? That starts with these letters. Some craptic. A word. Is that a word, craptic? Because. Anyway. Oh, God. So last week, one of these people from the East Midlands can't help swearing. Yeah. Tourette's Trent Derby. Tourette's Trent Derby. That's the sort of shite we're dealing with to try and get a Sony. Right, so here's the clues in that first one. And there what we. After here. The artist. Yeah, the bad name or solo artist. It's. I'll tell you. I'll tell you in a minute. Okay, go on. So the first one, the. The hitchhiker needs a lift, but in something bigger than a car. What's the initials? The H. Right. The itch. Iker needs a lift, but in something bigger. Than a car. Yeah. Right. Second one. Don't be selfish. Hand some of it out to your mates. Right. The initial there is C. Right. Don't be selfish, hand some of it out to your mates. Sure. That's not what is Carl, he's selfish. No, begins with C. Right. And the third one. The Scottish fellas can't get into their emails. Right, okay. The Scottish fellas can't get into their emails. Right. The initials there, kl. Right, so quickly again, the hitchhiker needs a lift, but in something bigger than a car. VH yeah, don't be selfish, hand some of that out to your mates. Right, See this is your last chance, Carl. And the Scottish fellas can't get into their emails. If I hear anything like Whetney Houston or D Trout Spinners or Tourette's Trent Derby coming out of this, we're never doing it again. Okay? Have you got monkey news for this week? Don't know if I want to do it this week. So just, just because breakfast. Do it and that and just, just leave it. Maybe this week, see what happens. See if we need it. See, we'll see. I sometimes, I don't know. Play Record a minute, Carl. I'll talk to talk to you off air. Play Record. What's the email address again? Ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk okay, that's where the email the answer's in. We've got to remind you who show it is. Play Record. All right. Stop. My head. Evan Dando on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais and with me arguing like nutters are Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Okay, all right, calm down. Right. Right, let's just chill. Let's just chill. Yeah, Right. What did you do last night? I watched I'm a Celebrity. Get Me out of here. I tried last week. I knew Tufnell was going to come through. I knew he was. I went, went to put a bet on and it was 11 to 4 and I thought, oh, that's not worth it. I could have put on 400 quid and I reckon I'd have won. I reckon he's going to win. Yeah. So that is annoying. I suppose if you could go back in time, you'd probably change things. Do you know what I do if I could go back in time, I'd go back in time, stop Hitler from being born. But then it might be worse cuz someone else might have come along and he'd have been even better. It's like a novel yeah. Ben Outon would write a novel like that or something, wouldn't he? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, things would be different. Yeah, yeah. I popped to the cinema last night and it was a joy of an experience because for the first time I want to see X Men 2. I want to see that. I saw one. I didn't. I don't like that sort of thing. I've never been a comic book. Never been a geek like yourself. Not yourself. I mean, I mean, you're not a geek in that, in that sense you're different. I mean, not your traditional sense. No, no, no, no. I'm one of those sexier geeks. Sexy geeks. Yeah, yeah. But I really enjoyed it. And two's meant to be even better. I really enjoyed it. Yeah, it's good fun. But, but more so than the film was the fact that the actual cinema experience, for the first time in a long time, I actually enjoyed. Because I just such a problem with the cinema. Go. I have to wait about three weeks. That dies down and go in the afternoon. I can't be sat next to people. I. I don't know why people go to the cinema to eat. Have some before you go in there. Yeah. RATTLING CRUNCHING what? Why, why is this experience, this, this film has cost 50 million pounds. It's meant to be an emotional artistic experience. It's not meant to be something that's on while you're chowing down. I don't know. People leave their mobile on. I want. When someone answer, you go, I can't talk now, I want to go. Don't you smack them on their face with it. Yeah, yeah. No, well, I, I went to the cinema a while back to see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Oh, yeah, that art house film. And woman sat next to me. Huge fat blubber of a woman, which. Is up to her. She's earned enough money, she can eat more than she needs. Sure. But don't squeeze into a seat next to me in the cinema, right. With your flesh, you know, curving over the armrest that we're having to share. Right next to her, a little weasel of a husband. She's got one of those huge kind of pog sized barrels of popcorn. You don't reckon he was one of them feeders? It was very similar. It really was. She's, she's, she, as you say, she's chowing down on the, on the popcorn. She's one of those women who. She's not come out to see a film, she's come out to eat. And if a Film happens to be showing, then she'll watch it. Yeah, really wounds me up. He's got the hot dog and everything. She's in and out. Popcorn already annoys me because she goes. To him, are you gonna eat that? Well, I was thinking of it. But I don't know why it was that popcorn became the thing you eat in the cinema. It's like you say you've made these films and someone's there thinking, well, we've made this great film. We've got the sound mix, right? But what we need is something that will just slightly irritate, irritate everyone during the film. And to see the size. They've seen the size of the buckets that go in their popcorn. But why not serve soup or something? Or the slurping will drive me mad and the spoon touching the bottom of the thing will drive you mad. Don't serve anything. There's no reason you have to do this tomorrow and go, oh, God, I need to eat. Well, this was. Plan it. You don't. You don't go and play tennis eating what you, you plan it, don't you? Well, exactly, exactly. Eat before you come out. Yeah. Have a sandwich. Have a. Call me sandwich. You know what? Right? What annoyed me is I found out in Across America when they showed Shinder's List, they banned Popcor out of respect to the film. What? So they're saying all the other films. Oh, sod it doesn't matter. Yeah, but this one cost 100 million. Ah, it doesn't matter. You can eat popcorn through that. I mean, ban it through all films. Well, this woman was one of those ones. She may as well have had a trough in front of her. I mean, she was a state. Right. She's an idiot as well, because the trailer comes from. I remember at the time the trailer came on for AI, that film. AI. Oh, yeah. And I don't know if you've seen the trailer for it, but it's something like. I don't know exactly, but it's something like. Martin is a six year old boy. Yeah. He's 20 kilograms, he's three foot high, but he isn't. But he is not human. Yeah, he's a robot. Yeah. And she's watching, she just goes. She's just watching that. Right. Bear in mind the point of the trailer. He's a robot. Yeah. She says, how old was he again? I wanted to slap her. I was livid. I went, he's a robot, he's a robot. That's what's important. She, she says, A trainer came on for a war film. She goes, I shan't be saying that. She just announces it. I shan't be seeing that. And I'm bored with war films. Bored with them Next. And then. So the. The. The title card comes up for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. You know, like at the beginning there, it comes up, crashing Tiger Dragon. Now she's in the cinema, she goes, what a stupid name for a film, I was thinking. But you pay to see it. And then it says subtitles in brackets. She goes, oh, it's not subtitled, is it? So it comes on, and I think in the film, I think they speak maybe Mandarin or Chinese or something. I'm not sure, but let's say it's Mandarin. So they come on, they start. And it's all subt. And they start speaking in this. In this Mandarin or Chinese. And she just starts going, ah ching cheng chong. Cheng chong. Ahing ching chong chong chong. In the cinema. Just saying that out loud. No, she and her boyfriend are cracking up. They're weeping with laughter. Right. And I'm trying. He's got a laugh. Otherwise she bites him. Exactly. So. So I'm actually. I'm so livid. So I really make a show of getting up with all my stuff. I get up and I kind of clamber over some of the seats. I sit down next to these two teenage girls with the mobile phone. Oh, mobile phone goes off. And like you say, instead of. I mean, it should have been off anyway. Yeah, of course. But let's say instead of it being. Instead of immediately thinking, oh, God, and switching it off hurriedly, they take the call in the cinema. I'm in the cinema. Yeah. No, I'm gonna start having a conversation, and I was thinking to myself, I was thinking, you're 16. Unless that is your business partner in Hong Kong phoning you saying the deal is not gonna go through, which I suspect it's not. I suspect it's probably Gareth or Gavin or your boyfriend Tony saying, do you want to do me behind the bike shed later? I suspect that's who it is. Yeah. Switch off the phone or very least, get out. I know. Get out. Cinema. But I just. I. I can't. I mean, I don't know where these people were brought up or raised. I don't know who it was that told them this was. This was. This is behavior that you could do. I. I really want to have cinema Police. Yeah, Right. You go in there, and if. If the phone goes off, you get your money back and you ask to leave straight Away, straight away. Any whispering go. If you whisper again, you know, if you're too stupid to be able to figure it. Yeah, yeah, just they, they tell you what age you should be, right, to get that film. Yeah, that's it. If you listen and you're not eating and you're not talking, then you should be able to get a film. Well, I was in the cinema last night and as I came in there was a big queue and I came in, there was people there taking a ticket, showing you to your seat. Now, when did it happen that I was no longer able to find my own seat at the cinema? Why is it that I can go in the daytime, I can find my. I'm left to fend for myself. But now it seems like there's so many stupid people out there. No, I think that is policing. I think that's to stop people thinking I'll just sit here and having to deal with it themselves. Because, I mean, if someone was in my seat, even if I, there was another seat, I'd go, well, no, that's mine. I, I, I want lots of, I want lots of policing. Yeah, in social occasions, I want to go into pub and go, that is too loud, that music. Those people are too annoying. They're standing up, they're too annoying. I remember being in somewhat and seeing a guy, he's a big fat guy again. He had popcorn, the hot dogs, the Coke, right? And he had it balanced on this little wall that was sort of separating parts of the cinema and he was eating, he was big fat guy, just sat there. I was watching, I think it was Beetlejuice. I was watching and some, some local hard nuts, they were on the same rock. They started kicking the little wall to. Knock his food off. And I thought, brilliant. Oh, no, I think you want to bully fat people. Yeah. Play a record, Carl. It's getting really nasty now. Can I pick on you? 50 cent in the club on XFM 104 point Ricky Ger with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkerton still arguing this time about having help from me and my dad. What do you think, Carl? No, I'm not. I don't want this to turn in some sort of wacky type thing where we're pretending we're arguing. Yeah, well, we're not pretending. You are. I know, I know what people think we're messing about. Oh, wouldn't have thought so. We just need to, we can talk about it later, sort it out. Yeah, it's just that Carl's a little bit stressed. I'm not Stressed though. And he doesn't really understand that, you know, me and Steve have got lots of different jobs in the week. He's just got one job and we. Sort of rely on people getting messages to us, you know, as soon as they get them, you know, not sort of deleting them from their phone selfishly, just things like that, you know, people being on the ball, not just thinking about themselves all the time, not just thinking about number one. What do you think, Carl? I have a whole. You know what I mean? Whatever. Don't get all Maud in again. Just having a little discussion. Yeah. This is annoying. Guess what? Think of this, you little slap head twat. Apparently. That's so nizar. That's so niz. Right. Apparently women can get bald treatment on the National Health Service but men can't. What do you think of that's fair. Is that a fact? It's a fact. We should point out that Carl is. Would you say balding? Yeah. Would that be fair? Either that or a wide parting. He looks like Charlie Brown. He's got the same sort of hair arrangement as Charlie Brown. Yeah. I don't think Charlie was balding though, was he was only about 10. Well, no, but he just had a couple of things on top. And his hairdo. Kyle's had a hairdo that keeps it. It's not a hairdo. What is it then? What is just happened? I've told you. No. Noel was in right. Once. Noel who? Gallagher. Oh yeah. Oh, you're on first name terms from the hood. Any and whoever was doing the interview said, oh, you know, will Liam be able to keep up that sort of hard attitude? Right. Say when he gets older and he goes bald and you know, could he still carry off the sort of attitude that he's got? And he was like, no, no, he'd never have that style. He couldn't. Couldn't. You couldn't have that style that lads got in there and pointed at me. Yeah. I said it's not a style. I said, I didn't go to the barbers and say, can you just like shave the top bit, leave the sides? Yeah. Can you remember those prior touch. That's the way it is. Yeah. And you were just saying to me, what would you do if you. If you went back in time? I'd probably use a better shampoo. I wish we could tape the conversations we have off air. Yeah. Because I mean they are ridiculous. What would you do if you go back in time? And the other stuff we were just talking about is obviously can't Talk about. Can I just ask, though, sorry, when did you. When did you start to notice it was disappearing? I mean, what age did it kick in? I worked a lot, you see. You'll be safe. Do you know what I mean? Your hair will stay there. But it's when I used to do a lot of hours. A lot of hours working. Yeah. You were stressed and things. Stressed out. Out. And they just went. Well, I'm beginning to understand what stress is like, you know, because I'm not getting messages and stuff like that. But, yeah, yeah, but probably about, I don't know, 20, 24. That's unlucky in it. Something like that. And did you. Did you panic or did you. Were you just quite bothered? Not bothered. He's not bothered. He wouldn't be bothered. But I don't think for someone who doesn't care about going bald or war or SARS or anything, you don't have to get stressed on a Saturday between 1 and 3, to be fair, you. Are worse than all those things. Cyrus has got nothing on you when you're in the right mood. But why is it all right for women, then, to, you know, have a wig, but I couldn't have one if I wanted one? Well, it's not a wig. They get bald treatment. They actually can get. They can get their hair replaced on the National Health, which might be anything, I suppose, which might be wigs, which might be transplants. I mean, the only cure for baldness is a transplant, which they literally take follicles. They get down to individual follicles now from the back of your neck. And, you know, it takes a long time and, you know, but, well, people. Will know anyway, won't they? I don't know when it starts, though. I don't know when it starts. Like now, if you started wearing a wig, people go, we were in a wig because you're bald yesterday. Yeah. You can't. You can't start thinking, right, I'm gonna go bald in a year, I'll start wearing a wig now. That's the thing to do, innit? It is, really, if you're that bothered. But I wasn't. I just thought, right, it's losing it a bit. Shaved a lot off. Did you know you had that round head underneath it? Did you know it was gonna be that funny, though? You would have. Well, you presumably worn a wig, wouldn't you, if you'd have known. Because I've never seen a head that round. I think the barber, when they did it, right, the woman said, you can pull that off you've got a good shaped head for. For having it shaved. She met good head. Yeah. She looks like a tennis ball. You look like a tennis ball when you haven't shaved. She said if you can pull it off. She said that's, that's like a good thing to see if someone's good looking. If you. If they can have a bald head head. It's like Sinead o' Connor. Yeah. Right. She can pull it off. There's those sort of things. Do you know what I mean? No, but that's like one of the things. If you look good with a bald head, that means you're pretty good looking. Yeah. And if you can wear a bicycle helmet and look good, that's another thing that like, you must be pretty good looking. Yeah. To pull that off. That you think that you think is good. Have you seen in the bicycle and thought, oh God, that must be good looking that good in the bicycle helmet. Everyone. No one looks good, do they really? Would you say Brad Pitt would look good in the bicycle helmet? I don't know, I'd have to see. But I'm just saying that's. That's like one of the two things really. That's. And what. What blokes you think look good bald? Who do you think would look good bald? Don't know. Give me some names and I'll tell you whether they'd be all right if they're bald. George Clooney. No, I don't think he does. I don't think he would do. Who else? Well, this could run and run. Al Pacino. Yeah, he could probably pull it off. He'd probably look alright. Do you think he looks alright with hair then? Yeah. Oh. Well done, Rick. Sony award winning stuff. Play a record. There's a guy going, oh, he's stressed, he's stressed. Wild Wild Horses by the rolling stones on xfm104.9 I'm looking to raise with me Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Little bald, heady Carl Pilkington. You quite like being bald, don't you? No fuss. Like I say, you know, I'll probably won't age for a bit now. What do you mean you won't age for a bit? Because I already look quite, quite old. I don't think so. Not with a hat on. You look really young. Yeah. Oh, I'm just saying so I won't change that much. It's like that. I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I actually don't think as long as you shave it straight back. I can't argue on that. Nothing wrong with it. But that kid who had that aging disease, just shave her head and she wouldn't age that fast anymore. Do you know what I mean? So this is the five year old girl who had an awful disease where. We don't know much about it to be fair. No, we just know that you fell in love with the title of the program, the Girl that was Older than Her mum. Right. And you were annoyed that people wouldn't serve her fags and alcohol. If she, if she's, if she's, you know, she's living like an 8 year old, let her have a fag. Doesn't that sum up this show though? Carl's comment, we don't know much about it. Yeah, we're still willing to make comments about it, to discuss it in length and possibly make crass jokes even though we're ill informed as ever. Ye, well, there's something for you. Right, go on. This is, this is what I wanted to tell you about. Right. Me? Yeah. Face transplants. There's this, there some kid somewhere, right, who had a bit of a, an odd looking face. A bit of a what? Bizarre looking face. Yeah. And there's a doctor somewhere who said I can sort that out for you. Right, sure. And basically what they do do is they've got to get a face off a dead person. Right, sorry, sorry. Just in this, in this documentary you saw, did this documentary feature say John Travolta and Nicholas Cage? Was it, Was it that documentary you saw? Right, listen, you see, go on. So, okay, sorry, sorry to dismiss the. Idea of face transplants out of hand. Go on. So yeah, it's got to be a face of a dead body that isn't older than like four hours old. Right, Four hours dead. Whatever. They can take it off, fit it on the new face. That makes sense. But it's not just your face that you lose it, but it's the muscle. It's muscle, tissue and bones, isn't it? When it's like disfigured, it could be through fire or whatever or disease or. So I can't just literally plunk a face on. They have to do something else, don't they? You're asking Carl? I forgot then he looked at that. Was that in Russian? Yeah. I wish we could get, I wish we could get him on telly just to show the look on his face when I said that. Yeah, it was brilliant, wasn't it? It was, you know when you were. Go to a cat. Hey, who wants Some food. Then he just looks at you. He goes. It's almost like he can understand what we're saying. Go on. It's like if you had been called holding a mallet over a dead body by the police. What I'm saying is they. It would sort. Would work. Yeah. If you took. If you peeled your face off and put my face on it. That. Oh, my God. Why don't you and Steve, for an experiment, swap faces? And the great thing is I wouldn't age. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Would you do that? If I could, if it was safe. I think I'm getting the rough deal in, though, to be honest. Yeah, well, no, you get some money back. It'd be part exchange. I mean, it would. You know, it's like you'd make up the difference just to wear your brilliant face for a week. But the doctor was saying, oh, it's not complicated. He said, the worst thing is something about the people who were related to the dead person. It's a bit weird for them still seeing the face of someone they know walking about when they're dead. Yeah, I can see that with the audio. I love you, Carl. You are brilliant. Honestly. You're never a dull moment. It doesn't matter whether you're talking or I'm squeezing your head. I'm never bored. I never go, oh, that's enough, Carl. Do you know what I mean? I never. I had battling tops. I got bored. It's like computer games. You think it's the best game in the world and someone goes, how you getting on with Tomb Raider? You go, I don't play it anymore. How's Carl? I go, he's brilliant. He's brilliant. I was squeezed yesterday. I was squeaking in his face. I got him down to the ground. He said this, he said that. I'm never bored with you. Do you know what I mean? It's brilliant. I'd like to rent you out to people see me. I'm different. I would happily leave him now in. The bottom of the cupboard until quiz. The scale electrics. Until the old pub quiz night when there's no one else who will have you on the team. And Su, you are your best mate. D him again. Yeah. Where's his mom and dad, then, Carl? Yeah. In Bristol. Yeah. Can't believe it. I love the fact you can insult me but never insult my parents, please. Feeder but Rogers XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steam merchant. Carl, Carl just said to me, said, what face would you have to me? And I went, what do you mean whose face would you have? And I went, I don't know, a boy. So the skin would be regenerated and I'll be a bit weird. He said, oh, no, someone famous. And I went, I don't know. I went, whose would you have? He went, barry Sheen? No, but what I meant was when I was talking to Suzanne, when I was talking to Suzanne about it, saying, this is amazing, she said, well, whose face would you have now? It's got to be fairly recent to have the skin fresh because it can't be too old. So I had a choice of like Barry Sheen or what's her face or Falasta Summer Wine. Who, who's the old woman who just passed away? Thora heard. Thora heard. So that's what I meant, if I could have any face. Because she said, well, you could have had Tom Cruise or something. I said, well, he's not dead. Give yourself restrictions in your fantasy. So I look down to your picture. I love the idea that someone getting you a call. Mr. Milkington, hello, it's Dr. Hanrahan. Barry Sheen has just passed away and you go, oh dear. Yeah, bad news and good news. Do you want his face? Do you want his face? Does Suzanne go out with you, like for charitable reasons? Is it like you can adopt a boyfriend? I love the fact that she encourages you. She was saying about Tom Cruise and I was like, oh, you know. She said, you know, he's not a bad looking fella or whatever. What she's saying is, Carl, is there any chance you could go and get a different face? Maybe something like Tom Cruise with Vena. Was saying, right, first of all, he's got to be dad and he's not. But if he was and you had that done, would you feel like people. Were looking at you on the tube? Well, no, like, say if the people who made Mission Impossible said we want to do a third one, would I then would I be in me right to say, well, I don't want to do it. I don't know what he's talking about. I don't mean to be offensive, Carl, but your girlfriend could do a lot better than you. I don't know what you think. I love the idea, this whole conversation about you with Tom Cruise's face and then get off with a film. Why does she have conversations like this with you? It was now on last night, it's now on the telly. What should we talk about? What about getting a nuke face? Oh dear. Oh, that cartoon. If you don't know what Carl, looks like there's a cartoon that was in last week's Heat, isn't it, that I drew it on the website. What's it going for now? Bid? I think it's at about 225 quid at the moment. And what do they have to do to bid for? Just. Just email in. I'll pass it on to the website people. I know why he put it in. It's because the editor, Boyd Hilton, looks a little bit like you, don't he? Sort of. Me ugly brother. He's probably listening. And he says nice things about you. Yeah, he can still say nice things, but I bet he knows deep down you know if you're good looking or not, don't you? I can't believe it. Come on, Steve. I mean, what are you doing? This is going. This is going crazy. No, Carl, I don't know. You're just. The insults are flying left, right and center. You've got no limits. You've just gone crazy, just gone wild. You're spotting around just because you look like Tom Cruise. I think it's because he's been hanging out with Christian o' Connell. Yeah. And they're both thinking, yeah, we're a. Couple of media players. Yeah. Too big for their boots. Yeah. Not scared. Although he's scared of Christian. He's scared of Christian in here because he's not allowed to do monkey news because Christian wants to do it. He's scared of him. I'm not saying that. Right, Christian. Once around the block, badly drawn boy. I like him. He's funny as well. You know what I think he looks like if me and you were put in a blender, Carl. Do you know what I mean? It's. It's sort of. He's got my sort of shape. He's got your sort of accent. And when you put in a blender, does that. What a voice. Sort of mix. The times I thought of putting the two of you in a blender. I told you that thing about the sponges, didn't I? Yeah, yeah, that freaked him out. You know, if you get two sponges and you dye one red and one blue and you liquidize them, we pour them into a tank of water. After a couple of hours, there's a blue sponge and a red sponge because their cells now and they, they reform. And you know what he said? He went, how'd you kill a sponge then? Yeah, of course. What a great thing to say. Oh, my back's killing me. Because I, I went, you know, I did my back in last Week. And I had to get a chiropractor out and I couldn't walk. Well, as soon as I could walk, I mean, I came in here on my day off and did a. When you were in Bristol with your mum and dad looking after you and. And then I went to Selfridges Sunday and you got a bit of money now? Why not? Yeah. And I went into the sports department and there's a golf simulator there, 38, 000 pounds and it's just like a shed. And I was looking at it like a kid in a sweet shop. And the two blokes that work there, they recognized me. All right? Yeah, good. When I was just looking at that simulator, it's brilliant. He went, do you want to have a go? And I went, nah, I' I can't hear it. I said. And I got a bad back. And then I went, you have a go. And he did it and cut down. He went, oh, that's not bad. And he went, do you want to go? And. Yeah, go on then. And. And I put the water. And I really tried my hardest. Of course you did. And it took off and it was really good shot. And he went, good. I went, I went, well, I said, I'm go. And I was thinking, I've got to hit this one as well. I've got to hit this one too. And I hit it again. I had three goes. I hurt my back after the first one. And I said, cheers, thanks very much. And I walked away. And I went to Jane, I went, went, I've gotta get a cab. She went, I've done my back. She went, well, why did you show off? I went, I had to. Of course you did. That sums you up. All the way back, I had to lay on the floor and put ice on my back again for about three hours. What was the best you thought could happen? That they would just say, oh, my God, that guy. That's Ricky Gervais. Is there nothing he can't do? That's exactly what I wanted, as always, I was seeing that. I go, cheers. As I got about a few yards away, I just slowed down and Jane go, what are you waiting for? I go, listen, and go, that man is a God. And I go, come on, Jane, let's go home. Yeah. Have you ever been able to walk through a fairground, pass, one of those machines, those test your strength machines, and not have a go at it? I don't think I'd be very good at that. I bet you cannot walk past one of those rifle ranges and not Have a go. I love rifle ranges, but you've got. To be the best, I imagine. Yeah. If someone had just won before me, I'll go, not worth it. It's fixed. Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, dear. Yeah. So that's why my back. It's ridiculous. But also, I don't. I hate not being able to do stuff. It's like I'm punishing the injury. Yeah. I know if I laid in bedroom it'd be better, but I go, no, why should I? Yeah. Ever used to. I used to. When I was a kid, I used to hit my head on the banister or summer and I used to go and get a hammer and hit the banister. And then I started thinking, when I was about 8, I remember if I'd hurt myself, I' go, haha. God, didn't hurt. He's up there thinking, oh, bloody hell. How mental is that? Carl, what are you thinking, mate? All right, Rock Busters? That's what I'm thinking. Straight to it. Straight to it. Go on then, who's the winner? We got to do the clues again. Right, the first one was the itch hiker needs a lift, but in something bigger than a car. Yeah, snappy. Go on. Vh. Yeah. Right. That was Van Halen. Van Halen hailing a van because he. Wanted something bigger than a car. That's the. That's the first one. Yeah. All the tenses are mixed up. Everything, it's just. Go on. Second one. Don't be selfish. Hand some of that out to your mates. That was C. That was share. All right, so. And the third one, the Scottish fellas can't get into their emails. The initials there, ks. They. Kenny Logins. Right. That's the last time we do blockbusters. That is the last time we do it. No, no, it is. That's the last time. Give the prize to someone. Kenny Loggins. I'm gonna give that one Kenny Loggins. Helen Perrott, she has emailed in and actually, Helen, I need you to email in your address, if you would, so we can send you those goodies DVDs in the bag and stuff. But who would get Kenny logging then? If. If the clue was good, who would get Kenny logging? What did he do? Footloo. Yeah, that famous film about where. Where dancing was banned. Yeah. In that nebulous. Yeah, that's an extraordinary film. I saw it once in America. Like you say, Kevin Bacon in a town where dancing has been banned. I was watching it. It was like if aliens had been watching Earth, but only monitoring us through our TV and films. Yeah. And then tried to make a film about humans. That's the film they'd end up with. What do they think? They think of Queen the Musical, because they're, of course, Rock and Rolls band. Isn'T it in the future. I'm not looking forward to the future, Rick, where feelings and emotions are going to be banned. I can't believe it. Where's our hoverboard? Yeah. So, yeah, well done to Helen Perry. Is that the last time we do Rockbusters? No. Yeah, yeah, after the break. Monkey News. No, we'll play. Oh, yeah, we'll do a break. Don't know about Monkey News. Got some other stuff as well. We're doing Monkey News after the break. Radiohead, they're there. Like everything they ever do. That's grown on me more and more. That is pretty brilliant. Xfm 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Well, you know what it's time for, don't you? Oh, chimpanzee that Monkey News. It always gets me, that jingle. It's a joy. Once more, please. Well, Carl, do you reckon you could sort out do other people that have real jingles with their name on it and don't have to say who's in the room, what's happening and do their own jingles? Well, Christian's got one for it, for Monkey News, that he does. Why is Christian doing Monkey News? I don't understand this because he did it ages ago. So you ripped it off. I ripped it off. I said to him, I said, there's enough Monkey News to go around. Well, hold on, though. I don't want cast offs. I thought this was your idea. Let's not do it. But what's new? What's new? What? There's Monkey News out there. I mean, if he wants to have a meeting in the week and say, well, this is the news I've got. The way I see it is he can do it in the week. He's doing like the, you know, know the news. That's hen type Monkey News. We're on on a Saturday. We're like the, you know, Jeremy Paxman, Monkey News night. We look at stuff in more in depth. Well, you can very much get behind the Monkey News. It's true. You sort of interpret it. You give it your own speaker. You're the man behind the monkey behind the news. I mean, I know that. Yeah. So ours is called Monkey News anyway. It's sort of generic term, like music. Ours is called Chimpanzee that, innit? Yeah, but he's, he's seen a bit of Monkey News in it. So are we doing it or. No, not. Well, I, I, I've got no reason to stop doing. He probably played Radiohead as well. Well, I know. Should we not do that? I said that David Attenborough did Monkey News before all of us, do you know what I mean? But I, I mean, I personally don't listen to Christian because I don't get up that early, so, you know, I'm missing out on a lot. I'm saying I don't get up that early. I'm not saying it's a bad show. My point is this. There's a lot of people, I imagine, who don't listen to Monkey News in the week, though. Perhaps they miss it, they're busy. It's nice to have a little kind of omnibus Monkey news at the weekend. We've come Pilkington. So that's what this is. So we're doing it, then. Let's play the jingle. Oh, Tim, fancy that. Monkey News night. Excellent. Good. So we'll sort of get some monkey experts on maybe next week to dissect it. Right, you ready? Yeah, all right. Is this monkey? Oh, yeah, it's called Jack. All right. I got Pally with this bloke who worked in a railway station. How pen pals? I don't know, I didn't say all Internet. I'm short names on the Internet. So anyway, he's helping him out all the time. It's this fella's job, right, to sort of make sure it's safe for the trains to come in, that sort of thing, right? But he's always working on his own, so he's got his mate Jack in with him, right? This, this little monkey and, you know, they're having a good time, they share lunch together and stuff like that. Anyway, it gets to a point when the fellow whose job it is is, right, starts getting old and Jack the Monkey starts getting more involved. Presumably this is a chimpanzee as opposed to a monkey, you mean? When you say monkey, it's generic term. You mean, you mean, you mean chimps usually, don't you? Yeah. So, you know, he's clocking the fella, doing his job and he's thinking, I can do this, right? The monkey, I love it. He's helping out, he's pulling down the levers and stuff. So the train sort of coming on the right line. Sure, sure, sure. Yeah. He's clocking it. He sticks his head out of the little window. See the trains coming. And that, I hope. British rider listening. Yeah, all right. In the end. Oh, yeah. The fellow whose job it is, he lost a leg for some reason. Couldn't work anymore. Lovely. Gave Jack the job. Right, okay. The railway company happy with that. I'm sure they. They interviewed a number of people, but he was the best monkey for the job and that's. That's good, isn't it? Well, it's not true. All right, once again, well, it's not true. Don't hand Steve a piece of paper that someone put on the Internet who is probably a bigger mentalist than you. That's not proof. It's not true. At no point did a railway company give a chimpanzee the job of signalman. It was ages ago. What? Steve, when was it? Before trains, probably. Well, it's in the 1880s. Yeah. According to this piece of paper, which is what you've based, you can use on now. Course, I think ITN and a lot of the news channels, they tend to get lots of independent confirmation of their news before they give it out as fact. But you've got an email from someone, so let's assume that's real. It says for this, Jack was officially put on the railway payroll, earning 2 cents per day and have half a bottle of beer on Saturday. That's what we pay you. He doesn't even get the beer. Oh, dear. He's not allowed to drink, are you? Someone emailed in, actually, and said, carl, some years ago, did you die? And they took your face and transplanted it onto that other gym. Pen, Zoo. It would make a lot of sense. I've never seen you. Never. He always has T shirts right up. And long sleeve. I bet he's hairy under there. I bet you are hairy because you have to shave right up to your eyes. You're one of them, aren't you? And I can see the growth and it comes out the. The top there. Are you really hairy underneath? Pretty hairy. Are you really? Well, what's wrong? What's up with that? You're. You're a human Z, aren't you? That's why you're fascinated with them and why your IQ is sort of. About. About 80. I think you might be you. I don't mean there was any. I think it was a genetic sort of. Sort of throwback. You're pretty airy. Look at your arms. Just look. Give me that banana and shut up. Play a record. That's mine. CHEERING BREAKS AVERAGE man on XFM 104.9. Well, nearly another show over, Carl, you know, I've got a squeaky chair there. Why don't you sort that out, have it oiled. What do you do in the week? Do you know what I mean? Can I just nominate a woman that annoyed me today on the Tube? I got off at Piccadilly Circus. The sign says Mind the Gap. Big sign saying, mind the Gap. Voice on the tannoy says, mind the Gap. Woman steps over the gap, goes, oh, that's dangerous. I was living. I was just annoyed. I wanted to slap her. There's always one in there every day. So as you walk down the street, I just feel like I want to squat certain people out the way, Squat them out the way. We went into this little restaurant, me go to me and Carl, was it Thursday? And we're sitting down there and it's busy outside, and we get the back. She went, that's no smoking. I went, yeah, we're not gonna smoke. So we sit there, right, about that. We get there, there's just another. There's two women that, right? I'm sitting there and they light up a fan. And I go to Carl, it meant me no smoking. He went, yeah. So I went, where's the principle? It rules are there. He goes, rules. You say twat, muff. And on air. Never mind rules. Well, they've annoyed me now, right, yeah. So the waitress comes over and he put the egg. He's. Oh, God. He put his head down as well. I said. I said. I don't know why I said it like this. I went, I thought it was no smoking, of course, right. She went, it is, yeah. And I went, right, okay. Well, they're smoking. She went. She went, well, you'd have to move then. I went, what? She meant if you want to smoke. I said, no, I don't want to smoke. I said, they're smoking over there, right? Try not to. And she went, oh, well, I told you. I said, no, I don't want to smoke. They're smoking. She went, all right, And I gotta move, didn't I? See, that's a little snitch. Yeah, but it annoyed me. Do you worry, though, that someone's gonna look around and go, it's like Ricky James off the telly. Yeah, well, I can't complain now. If I go in, I get bad service. I can't complain because I think, oh, look at him. He thinks. Thinks he'd complain. So I have to do it. I have to do it secretly. Yeah. You know what I mean? But, oh, there was oh God, right. People come up to me, they recognize me and they all give a lot of us and I, I don't mind it at all. I don't know, I never know what to say. And I'm always, you know, I say, thank you very much, I say, love a show, whatever. I said, of course, and that's great. And they're polite. And I was in the pub the other day and I was just with Johnny and people have been coming up, they go, to your mind. I said, no worries at all. Yeah, absolutely fine. All right. And.
