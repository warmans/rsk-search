  "text": "Clocks from The Coldplay, MX FM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and back, Carl Pilkington. He's raring to go. It's nice when you have a bit of time off in it. Yeah. How long have you had off now? Three weeks? About three weeks, yeah. We can't do that because we're sort of self employed. We'd be letting people down. But it's different when you, you know, you get paid anyway, whether you turn up or not. But good to have a job. Never off ill. That's the first time I did not feel like. I mean, just, you're off two weeks and then you're off. No, I just wish I was the kind of person who could let down an audience. Yeah, but like I say. Well, no, we spoke to you. Weren't that bad a cold. You don't go in for a cold. And we were discussing this last night in the pub and you know, you don't go home for a cold. Okay then. So moving on. What have we got then? We've got some great songs. I've brought in the Smiths, I brought in Buzz Cox, I brought in Neil Young. I know Steve's got some hip hop. Some great hip hop. He's got some great Elvis Costello. It's going to be great. Carl, come on, concentrate. You've been always three weeks. Just a noise. No, stop saying that. You're eyeing me now. Why, what are you gonna do? Go home ill. Oh. Oh, he's annoyed me. Oh, has he? Yeah, I got wedgie. I'm a little bit annoyed. Can I have some time off but still get paid? Yes, of course you can, Steve. Right. He called me up, winding me up about this and. Right, I'm. I'm nearly. I'm 30, right, I'm 30 now. I can only remember being off two times. Oh, his memory's going as well. You'll have to put him off. And both of them were when I was at school. School one when it was windy. Did you have time off because it was windy? But to be honest, Carl, that lasted for seven years. Your time off at school, why did you have time off? Because it was windy. Were you windy or was it windy outside? It was a really. It was like when your auntie wasn't. Out the window, was she? When the winds were bad in the 70s, I mean, mum said. Oh, I remember space hoppers and flares. I don't remember the winds being bad in the 70s. Well, my mum just said you might get Blown into the road. So don't. She had so much faith in you, didn't she, as a human being. Is that why she got fired from the pie shop? I'm not coming in today. I might get blown into the road. Oh, God. Funny thing it was, right, Steve, they had this, this thing going at school because a lot of people used to wag it back then, Mr. What? Wag it. Sort of not go in, right. And they sort of tried to make it interesting for you by giving you an education, a certificate, a full week. Reward for the rest of your life with achieve that sort of, that sort of carrot. And also like let you go home at 3 o' clock on a Friday if you'd done a, like a full week in that. Yeah. So it was, it was lovely weather all week. Then it just sort of changed on a Friday and I got off and it was all windy for Friday. On Sunday, don't, don't, you know, if you don't want, don't go in because, you know, you might get blown into the road and that. So I said, all right, then I'll stay off. So why did you. Told you to hold onto a fence or walk you there. What's this? Don't go out immediately. Give up. I love this, getting blown into the road. Is that based on your cats that kept getting blown into the road? Well, so I got to. Got to school on the Monday, right, And the teacher said, right, today to punish you. You're the only one who wrecked the whole week, right? Everyone else came in, you didn't. So everyone else is going home at 3 o' clock today. But you're not brilliant. Serves you right. And I wasn't bothered, though. It was great because I said, well, you'll have to stay with me, won't you? It was great. So all I did for half an hour was doodle and stuff. It was great that afternoon. Yeah. And that, that was ages ago. That was like when I was about eight and that's one of the times. I was off ill. Yeah, that wasn't even ill. That was wind. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, yeah. It's a bit different when you can't just not turn up because you've got a bit of a cold or you're a bit fed up. I mean, we had an appointment, 4 o' clock, Thursday, wasn't it? And he had to call, he said, I'll cancel it. I went on meeting, went on a bit late. Yeah, Time management, get things done. If it was important, you'd get it done. Play a Record. Carl, pull your finger out, please. I was Costello. Alison. What a great track that is. Beautiful. Well, Carl, we better tell him all the new great features we've come up with in the time you're off. Right, well we'll. We've got the film thing still going. Okay. That's where you take a lead role or a major role in a Hollywood blockbuster which we then give away on VHS worth Â£6.99. And something new we're trying out because Rockbusters. He's dead, thankfully. Yes. He's gone for a bit. It's over. Crosswords. Crossroads. This sounds intriguing. Where'd you get the idea from? What's the basic format of this? Right, what I've done is I've take like a popular saying from the show. A popular saying. Something that crops up quite a lot in the show. In our show. Yeah. Yeah. First thing that spring sort of sprang to mind was there's this airy Chinese kid. Oh, classic. But more commonly it would be something like, Carl, you're an idiot. Yeah, Carl, you idiot. Carl, you're a fool. Oh, what did you mean you let us down again? Yeah, been. Oh, you've got a headache, have you? Carl, you better have a lie down. Typical phrases like that. Typical phrase like that. Yeah. Carl, you're a loser. Yeah, right. And what I've done, I've got a load of different songs and took words from the different songs and then joined them together. Yeah. To make. There's this airy Chinese kid. And then people have to email in and say what the five songs were. It sounds like the most complicated game ever. I'm looking forward to it. Have you heard any of this, Rick? Because I've not heard this at all. I'm not familiar with this. Well, all it is, it'll go like Eric Chinese Kid. And it's from sort of four different songs and you've got to identify the songs. Right. Wow. How many songs in this car? 5. 5. There's this hairy Chinese kid. Okay, right, so what are the prizes for that? Are these the prizes? Yeah. All right, well, let me tell you what they are. They're not too bad actually. We've got Live Forever, which I assume is a CD that ties in with this new film. Look at that. A well known phrase from the show and it's hairy Chinese kid. What other. Where would you. There is no other radio show in the world. I. This is. Go on. If you've just tuned in. I mean, what are you thinking? If you've just tuned in, going, well, Known phrase from sure. Airy Chinese kid. Oh, yeah, classic. They'll be playing that in charades this Christmas. So, yeah, this is a CD that ties in with this new film, Live Forever, which is all about Brit pop. And so there's stuff on there from oasis, blur, pulp, etc. We've also got another Red Dwarf DVD, Marion and Jeff, the first series of that. Excellent. That's on vhs, sadly, but never mind. And. And also the Very Best of Led Zeppelin, a two CD set there with all the classics on. So that's not bad. Prizes. You've done yourself. We've upped it. We're getting serious now. We're playing in the, you know, the bigger league. It's. We've upped the stakes. We want Heat magazine not to, you know, lose touch with us just because Rockbusters is gone. I think they're still behind us. So we've got. We've got. We've got film. You appear in the film. We've got crosswords. How is that to do with the crossword? Because I've got words and sort of cross them. Okay. Good. So, words. We're playing a game called Words. Word Song. Hello and welcome to Word Song. And obviously I imagine there'll be some more great music, but we've got a. New feature, haven't we? Which one's this are we doing? Within the Monkey News, the new feature. Oh, Steve, I'm excited. You know, Monkey News is my favorite feature. So what have you added to it? Explain it. Right, well, there's been loads of stuff going on in the past few weeks. Right. But for the times when I struggle, when. When sort of monkeys have had a. Quite weak. And there isn't that much news going on, come up with this thing, I sort of speak to an expert. I've spoke to him already. You spoke to an expert? A monkey expert, yeah. And I ask him a question. Wow. Right. The feature, it's got a good name, you know, that's the way I work. Yep. Cheap as chimps. And what I do, I ask them a question about, you know, how much does it cost to, you know, keep one? How much did it cost to, you know, feed one for a week? Yeah, all this sort of stuff. So I give out like a monkey story. And if that isn't enough for people, they'll also learn something else at the end of it. Right. So, like, it sounds fascinating. Can I say right now, that's just. Some of the things that we've come up with. Play a record, Carl, please. Still continue to Listen there. Yeah, Come on. Come on down. Richard Ashcroft. Buy it in bottles on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais. Steve Merchant. Carl Pilkington. Carl, I need the phone number of your girlfriend. Let me explain why I was lucky enough once again to be on your quiz team this week. Richard still to beat me. He's still to beat me with his team. Second. I came the gang here and some friends, we sometimes go down to a pub quiz in the local area and I was very nicely. I was invited by Carl to be on his team. Twice now I've been on that team. Ricky's always on another team and I. What can I say, Carl, do you mind me saying this now? Because I've analyzed the team and it's very much your team and you've put the team together, you've recruited some excellent personnel. Your girlfriend's very, very good on the team, as is one of her work colleagues. And you normally bring in someone like myself. I like to think I'm providing certain something with the entertainment section, I think. Remember last time I answered at least six or seven questions that other people hadn't got. So I felt I provided something there, Carl. Rather like John Harvey Jones, who used to be called in to sort of troubleshoot companies. I see why you are not winning ever. And it's a rather pricey contest, isn't it? Cost a tenner to enter per person and unless you get in the top three, you're not going to get to see your money back. So I think you're going to maybe need to step down from the team because, Carl, I'm not sure, I am not sure you consider yourself a kind of player manager, but frankly, I'm not sure you're providing enough. Right. See, this is funny because as bad as I imagine you are, I don't think Steve would make it into my team. So he's getting a bit cockier. I want to know what your opinion of him because he's told me he's great on it. Well, you bang out of order, first of all. Okay, do you have a good night when you're with us? I tell you what, I wish I. I wish I hadn't lost a tenor every time I've come down. That would have improved it. You point out there about the football analogy. Alex Ferguson, when did he score a goal, right? He doesn't. He tells the others how to do it. Right. Does he take up one of the 11, though, does he? No. Exactly. It's not like you can only field 10. Yeah. Because we only got 10 again. Yeah, I want to be in the 11. Exactly. You stopped running around in midfield, falling over. Yeah. Shouting, oh, what have I told you? Yeah, no, right, I'll admit. And there's a limit of five players. We should explain that. That's the point. There's only five players on players. Yeah, so. So it was pretty tricky on Tuesday, though, when it was one of the tougher. Tell everyone the one question you got right. It was something about, well, tell us the answer. The two words you had to say to get the answer. Danny Minogue. Danny Minogue. That was what you provided. Danny Minogue. Is this valuable? Well, no, no, no, not really. Because. Because there was at least two of us who also knew the answer. Oh, well, we gave him. No, exactly. We gave it to Carl. We massaged his ego. But I just feel. Can't do what. I'm a little. I feel a bit bad now because I just had a crushed face. Can I just tell you right now? He just can't believe this. Can I just tell you right now? I think the problem is this. I think there's that precious fifth position that is not being filled at the moment, I think, consistently enough by a decent player. Right, You've got a solid team. I'm thinking if you want to remain on the team, you are going to have to pull your finger out and find a fifth member that is going to provide. And I'll tell you where the weaknesses are. I can tell you right now, mate, the weaknesses are natural history and science, something which Ricky Gervais is scoring on week in, week out on his team available for a transfer. We could be fine, but we've got to find someone to fill in that space. Otherwise I'm either gonna quit or you're gonna have to step down. Because I don't think I can be on a team where there's obvious deficiencies. There are visible deficiencies. And you know the ten pounds, that's ten pounds. I'm not made of money. That's once a month. I've seen him depressed for two hours when he lost 20 pounds at a casino. Don't bring it. Don't bring that back. Don't bring up that again. He doesn't like wasting money, Carl, you know that. What do you think? What do you think? What's the solution? We've got to be. We've got to think proactively now. We've got to sort this out. See, there's always other things going on in my mind when I'm in that pub quiz. For me it's just a little bit of fun. Sure, it's a night out. I mean, Suzanne enjoys it. Yeah, bit of a get together. We have a chat beforehand. Yeah, we have a bit of fun. But there was other things on my mind. I could do that here. I don't have to lose a tenor. Wait, what were you thinking during the quiz then? When the questions were coming out, what were you thinking of? Well, what it was, right, just before the quiz started, I had to go to toilet, right? Because the rule is, right, people who don't go to it, once it starts, phones off, no more toilet. They take it dead serious, don't you? Right, yeah, yeah. So I went to the toilet. Now I'm not being out of order. It just got me thinking, right, I went to the toilet. The gay fella in there, right? There was a gay fellow in there. Gay fellow in the toilet. Now, how could you tell? How did you know? Just typical. You know everything about it, right? It. Everything about it, Right, yeah. Moustache, leather cap, butt plugs, ammo, nights out. Could I just say that these views do not reflect the views of the management of XFM or me and Steve. Or most of the people in this country. Go on, Kyle, what's your problem? Yeah, but this is what I'm worried about, really. But this is why I only got Danny Minogue, right, right. Because this was floating around my mind. Going to the toilet. They have. They have like men's cubicle and they have women's cubicle. Yeah. Now, without sounding out of order, is it wrong for me to think gay men should have their own little cubicle? They should have their own. Well, not cubicle. You mean an actual toilet? I suppose when I was at the urinal, yeah, Normally, you know, there's a fellow there and then you go, all right, and there's no pressure. But I couldn't, I couldn't go. I was thinking, should I wait if I go into the toilet, it'll look obvious. Yeah, I had loads of pressure. What were you worried about? Sorry? What were you concerned about? I'm so sorry. Well, it's like, right, listen, when I was a kid, right, and it's all right for you to go into women's toilets when you're kid. It's like, oh, it's a bit cute, right, as long as you're not like over 15 or something. Right, right. But when I was a kid, I went into a toilet and women, when they use their little cubicles, they don't shut the door. Some of them just sit down on The. On the toilet. Right. And you see everything. No, seriously, that's probably one of the first times I saw like a woman. Yeah, that. Right. And my auntie Nora when she was staying over. What happened with your Auntie Nora? She was. She's into wearing caftans. Into wearing what? You know, caftans. Oh yeah. What Caftans. Big bellowy sort of dresses. Right, right. And yeah, I, I used to sit on the floor at home. In front of the telly. Sure. She was on the chair behind. She did a bit of a sort of a Sharon Stone scene. Oh God, yeah. Did you see it? There was no underwear. No. What age were you? What was it like? What age were you? He's like a ripped tennis ball. What? Right, we're off air. We're off air. Either that or put in for the sonies iced tea. That's how I'm living school. Hip hop. Where's rt? Good point. Yeah, go make me a cup. Well, before you do that, can I just qualify something? I'm a little bit concerned about your, your toilet discussion. What exactly is your point again? I'm just a bit bemused. See, it's a tricky one. All I'm saying is right there, I was at the pub quiz, I go to the toilet, not thinking about anything. I try to go, right, there's a little gay fella next to me. I love this little gay fella. Now the weird thing is there's nothing stopping him having a little, little glance. Right. Because he's allowed in the fellows toilet. Yeah. Now I'm not allowed to go into the woman's toilet. Another little, have a little look round. So all I'm saying is should they have another, Another toilet area? What, for gay people? Yeah. And so this would be gay men and lesbians. Is that going to complicate things? I can only assume. I mean, to our point. That's your question, right. If you're intimidated, that's, I mean that, that, that's a shame. But you know, most gay men aren't looking at your knob. You know that. What do you mean? I can only say that 99.9 of gay men who use a urinal standing next to what they assume is a heterosexual man aren't looking at his knob. What they're doing then? They're, they're emptying their bladder. No, but the thing is I can't, I can't talk. You're saying, you're saying like you know about. Would you have one toilet for lesbian women and gay fellas? Right. Where's that be weird? Would it be mixed? Would it just be. Would it have a man and one that's petrified man. One little picture of a woman and then what. What would the little icon be to. A man and a woman? A man and a woman just having a chat. Yeah. In pink and dark. You couldn't mix them because then what would happen is you'd get people who are going, oh, I'll play. I'll play up to this a bit. Or pretend to be gay and. Yeah. You know, sort of grow a mustache. And shave their head and pretend to be a lesbian. Right, yeah. So. So I see. So you know people pretending to be gay so they could go in and have a look at the lesbians. Yeah. Right. So that would mean that we need four cubicles now, wouldn't it? Yeah, no, this is fine. Four cubicles. So every pub. How many toilets do we need? Every pub's now got four toilets. Oh, Carl. Bisexuals. Yeah, now, interesting. Bisexuals, how many toilets do we need now? Call the council. They use any. Huh? No, no, because they're interested in everything, aren't they? Because a little bisexual fellow will be looking at your knob right. With them. What you do, you just have a door. You open it and there's one urinal there, so you can't get a cue. They have to. They have to sort of wait. I've just thought that. Well, why can't there just be a thing between the urinals? So anyone. No one can look at anyone else's nose. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait. A minute, wait a minute. Just to go back to Ricky's point, what stops? Even if we've got the toilet for gay men, what stops? The gay men who want to have a look at your willy going in the regular toilet and pretending that they're straight. Most men don't wear. The police don't wear gay across there. They don't have a tattoo. There's no branding yet in the British Elsewhere. They have to declare. So we're gonna have to expand this so we've all got a carry identity. You can see a guy. Can you, coming a mile off. No, no, I'll just hold it in next time. No, no, no, no. Can you tell gay men. Do you know a gay man? I'd say probably if you did, like if you lined some people up. Yeah. And said point them out, I reckon I'd get. But hold on, we're not talking about people dressed in nether with the ass cut out and an andbar mustache. Yeah. We're talking about, you know, the everyday. Yeah, but I mean, supposing I put you in a room and there was 10 naked men, right? Yeah. And could you. There's five gay men and five pets. Could you walk along that line looking at those gay. Am I naked? No, you don't have to be naked. Why would you have to be naked? To catch them out. Play a record. How would you catch them out? Don't go into it. Don't go into it. Don't go into it. Play a record. Heaven knows I'm miserable now. Would you share a toilet with Morrissey from Manchester? You'd have a lot to talk about, wouldn't you? Yeah, yeah. We've had an email, Rick, from Jim, and he's just simply said, what about a separate cubicle for Bold Mancunians? Wow. Makes a lot of sense. Yeah. You just have your own toy. Yes. The thrills One Horse Town on XFM104.4.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Now Carl Pilkington is getting ready. It's the start of a new strand in the show, a new quiz, a new competition to replace Rockbusters. Now that's quite a tall order, but what have you done? Right, like I said, right, if you've only just tuned in, what it is I took, and I'll be taking a well known saying every week from the show. Something that crops up a lot. First one that sprang to mind was. There'S a little gay fella standing next to me in the oil. That's next week. Okay. This week there's this airy Chinese kid, right? Yeah. That's crops up quite a lot, sweeping the nation. Right. So what I've done, I've got five songs. Yeah. And I've edited them together to make that saying. You've got words you from songs where any part of that sentence occurs to recreate it. Now what do they need to do? Do they need to say what the song is? Just the five songs. I mean, I was going to say song and artist, but if you want just a song. So five, there's five things there and if someone doesn't get all five, it's still worth emailing in because we might give it to the one who's got the most. And then can I suggest we go for artists rather than song only because sometimes it's quite tricky to get a song title. Sometimes it's a more it's free odd or it's not quite what you think it is. So maybe artist is an easier one. Are you happy with that, Carl? It's your competition. I mean, Steve always does this whenever I come up with an idea. Oh, yeah. I just try to make sure it's just the best it can be, Carl. Yeah. No, he came up with a few games shows and Steve was going, no, it's no good. And Carl said to me, he said, it's the wonder the Office ever got on telly. Yeah, but, well, we shall see how Cheap is Chimps Plays out. But frankly, the fact that you said to me, steve, I've come up with the best game show ever. It's called Cheapest Chimps. What's the idea? I don't know. I just like the name. Something to do with chimps. I thought, well, I'm not sure that's the best. The best game show ever. And what was the other one you came up with? I think a few people will be disagreeing with him, Carl. I think people will say that cheap as chimps could be the best game show ever. You know, when I was in school, people like you, I really didn't like. You're a stirrer, Gervais. He flits, doesn't he? From one side to the next. Carl. The one thing we may argue, mate, but at least we're consistent. Ricky Gervais flipping from one side to the other one day to Karl's side. When was the last time Steve wrestled you to the ground and got you in a leg clamp? No, you're right, never. What, is that supposed to be a good thing? Well, didn't you see us? Yeah, I saw you struggling in the. In Kyle's office earlier. He was punching my legs to release me on the floor and I was squeezing him with my mighty legs, wasn't I, Carl? It was like. I imagine that's what a crab feels like when an octopus has got it. We were playing that, weren't we? So anyway, so I'll play this clip now. It's 10 seconds long. We'll play it a couple of times because you'll need to take it in. So here it is then. What we saying? We're saying artists. Let's go with artists. Artists. So email in ricky.gervaisxfm.co.uk name the five artists it has taken to make up the saying Chinese kid. Give that email address again. Ricky Gervais at xfm.co.uk. There'S the very Chinese kid. Here we go. Play again. There we go. I think you better play it once more. I've got. I've Got them. You got them all? Yeah. That's nice work. There we go. I can just remind you now that the prizes include a Red Dwarf dvd, Marion, Jeff, the first series of that on vhs, a Live Forever Brit pop cd, and also the very best of Led Zeppelin. Let's play one of those actually, while we're here. Brilliant. Rock and roll. One of the prizes on Carl's competition this week is the very best Led Zeppelin. That's obviously rock and roll. We also got a Live Forever Brit podcast pop cd, Marion and Jeff and Red Dwarf. And should we play it again? So people got very Chinese kid. Who are the artists? Here we go. It's tricky. It's not very easy. Once more. One more. There you go. Ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk. those prizes can be yours. I at the quiz also discovered, of course, and. I don't know, I'm just intrigued to know, Carl, I'm just intrigued to know. It was your girlfriend's birthday, wasn't it, earlier in the week or last week? I mean, obviously it was a triumph with the stuff you got for Christmas. The condoms. The box of condoms. Box set of condoms. Not just. Not just the singles, the whole. The whole set. Yeah. A complete collection. Brilliant. So what'd you go for? This one? Yeah, but. No, no, no. Yeah. No, no, no. Yeah, but it's your birthday. How long you been together? About nine years. Okay. So. Oh, God, it must cost you so much. No, but it starts getting tricky, doesn't it? Because I spoiled her a lot in the first few years. Yeah. Here's a packet of rubber bands. Oh, well, she. It's what she wanted. I mean, you're making out as if. No, everyone wants paper clips. Come on. What did you get her? Got her a new pair of gloves. Right. All right. Well. And what? Nice, nice leather ones from Selfridges or Howard's or something. They were good ones. They're the sort she likes. So they weren't the little woollen ones that she had. Yeah. I thought that was a joke when she said, he got me these because I laughed. No, that's. But I know that's the one. She did have the. When they said, it's his birthday, right, it was her birthday Monday, and me and Steve wanted to get her and she went, he got me these because she had those little woolen gloves on. I laughed because I thought she was joking, Carl. That's what she wanted. I've told you before about buying presents. Those gloves have your name sewn in them and a piece of String that ran over the back of your duffel coat. You know, I've never been into getting presents and that I had the problem at that Christmas one, that time with the Victoria plum. Yeah, we'd hate that. We'd hate to bring that back. We've done that. Because you talked about the book. Because it's kind of to do with your dad, isn't it? He's. He's a very bad gift buyer. Was that the problem? Well, yeah, my dad's. I mean, my dad just wouldn't bother. It was my mum who sort of made an effort and she sort of worked out half of what I wanted. Then she left it to me dad to get it off someone, see if he could get one cheap or whatever. I love the fact that you usually. People talk about, like, drinking heavily or violent abuse, right? But here's what he's been left with and scarred with for parents is bad gift buying. Yeah. And the Victoria Club incident. In the greatest scheme of things in the world, that's not a bad thing to have, is it? This is what it's like about getting presents and stuff, right? We'd meet with my mum and dad. Go on. We mate Colin, right? No, Colin Daly. He had a little Sinclair Spectrum, right, Computer, which was like the thing to. Have at that time, right? You always go around to his house. The deal was not the one you. Had to play through the window because you weren't allowed. No, no, that's another lad. Oh, yeah, this is. This is a different lad. And the deal was he came to our house. I mean, Mum gave him a pie and then I'd go around to his and I'd stay there for a few hours playing, you know, Hungry Oris and stuff like that. Now, my mom and dad knew that I really wanted one of these computers, right? So I waited about a year, came around to Christmas Day. I thought, I reckon, might have one. Turned out they bought me the wrong one. They bought me a ZX81 instead of a Spectrum, right? And Christmas Day, I'm there trying to load the games up. It's not working. I'm thinking, what's wrong? Right? And the thing with me, when I was a kid, I used to get quite sort of agitated. This is the moment, right? I found out that it needed a RAM pack to make it work, right? Looking in the thing and it's saying, and make sure you put your RAM pack in the back. And I was like, oh, where's the RAM pack? And my dad's going, I don't know. I'VE got you the main bit. That's. That's it. So I was that wound up, I just was sick. Just sick. I didn't feel sick or anything. I just was like, oh, God. Went to the sink. Just sick. Because I was that on edge about it. I said, come on, we've got to get one. I mean, that's like Tandy's shut. We're not gonna. We're not gonna get anything today. Ruined again. Christmas Day. That was after the year when my train set got blown up by our kid. The following year, no Ram Pack. And now you ask me, why don't I get good presents? He's scarred. He just. Just. I'm gonna die. Honestly, I'm gonna die. Just clean sick. Yeah. Dano. Rampack. What? Why did you get to the bottom? Why wasn't there a rampack? You have to buy them separate. What do you mean? I can't play frogger? Oh, no. So wasn't there another incident when you threw up? Spontaneously threw up, through sheer anxiety. I do get it. It's not so much now because I've relaxed a bit, but as a kid, I used to be quite on edge all the time with certain things. Do you think that's what happened to you? The wind that kept being sick, that it didn't get the food it wanted and it just threw up? Do you remember that? Yeah. Yeah. God. So they shaved it. Yeah. But again, you see, the cap thing, I mean, it's mad. I was thinking about the other day, right? I used to think I had quite a normal upbringing. He didn't. Right. And someone was talking. Your mother once told you not to go to school because it was windy. Carl. It was not a normal upbringing. The cat was being sick, so she shaved it so it was easier to clean. Well, my mum and dad went on holiday, Right. And I stayed at the Rosses down the road. Oh, yeah. Only a kid. Must have been about five or something. Right. And I was always running around in the house. I had a lot of energy as a kid. What the Rosses did, they had this cat that was dead violent. The most violent sort of angry cat I have ever. A tiger, it was. Honestly, Steve, if it was bigger, it would have been because it was just always having a go at you. Yeah. If you went to pie on the head, it went to bite you and stuff. And what they used to do with it, to stop me running around, I'd sort of be running around and then I get a bit tired and they say, have a lie down on the. Say so I'd lie down on the setting and I'd nod off. And what they used to do, I'd wake up and they've put the cat on my belly, right. So I'd be scared to move because it's like it's gonna get me. But it would keep you there? It kept me there and it used to sort of slather on me and they'd sort of, you know, go out or whatever and I'll be lying there. That's not normal, is it, Carl? Sorry. Were you created by the Brothers Grimm for one of their fairy tales? What kind of a life is that? A cat paperweight to keep Carl in place. He keeps blowing around. It's windy. We'll have to weigh him down. Be careful. Your mum probably told him that it's a windy day. He gotta keep somewhere heavy on him otherwise he just gets blown into the road. God bless him. Carl, let's just hear your, your thing once more. Give people a final chance. All right, here we go. Ricky Gervais@xfm.co.uk. Strokes Someday do email in if you've got any of these. Because most people only got three out of the five. Only one person's got four and they haven't got the second bit. The this of there's this airy Chinese kid. I reckon if you've got that. I realized that I've only got four. I got that one wrong. So that's the one to get. All right, excellent. Can't stop the spirits when they need you. This life is more than just a read through. Oh, those chili peppers are quite hot. Can't stop. XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais, with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkerton. Carl, you know what, you know what the time is? Bong Monkey News. Yeah, right. Imagine if Clever McDonald started like this. Yeah, there's. There's been a lot of stuff going on on that with monkeys. Oh yeah. I've also. I was mentioning earlier how we sort of making the Groucher the feature grow a bit. Right. So I'm thinking. Oh, I haven't told you Steve either. I've actually been asked to write a thing about monkeys. A poem? No, no. For a magazine called Something Apes. Right. They want me to do like a column, 500 words about monkeys. Anything I want on monkeys. Anything. What are you gonna write? Davous. You know, think about it. Well, give him a tight way. Come up with Shakespeare eventually. Yeah, you could write about that. Why didn't you write about that you don't. The fact that you don't believe it. You don't believe that an infinite number of monkeys could type because he was a Shakespeare. Because you reckon most women have read Shakespeare if they wouldn't know some of the spellings. Exactly. It wouldn't happen, you idiot. Get on with it. All right, the. There's been a few things, but one that springs to mind is they found a load of monkeys somewhere. This is brilliant. Yeah. I mean, imagine this if this was news. Yeah, go on. Where? Somewhere. I think it was in 17th century. I don't. It doesn't matter that bit. Okay. Find a load of monkeys that are having a good chat. Go on. They're having a good chat. All right. We found monkeys that can talk. Yeah. About. They've worked out they've got about 534 different words that they're using to, like, have a chat about more than you. Yeah. What do they chat about then? Just, you know, things that monkeys are worrying about. Just, you know. Where do you get that from? You know, who does your hair? You're going over there again. Yeah. Have you seen that? Sorry, you can't just leave that. No, no, I'm just intrigued. I'm just intrigued to know what else? Is there any. Were they discussing the Humanzi? Did you see that program on Channel 5? He can walk up, right. Yeah. Did you see how well they taught them that? They taught it. They taught themselves this language. Yeah. Where. Where is this? In the wild? Is this. Is it not sign language? It's in. In some jungle somewhere. They found these monkeys. He had some, you know, some explorer was over there cutting through the. The woods and that, and he heard. His name and he thought that's what he went, what do you want, brother? It wasn't me. I didn't say. I didn't say always. Snodgrass. Where'd you get that gun? Yeah, exactly. Well, it's only me and you here. Yeah. That's weird, isn't it? No, it's not weird. It's not true. Right, come on then, what's next again? But what I'm thinking, I mean, that did happen so well, and to sort of add to that feature. That's not true. We're doing cheap as chimps. Right, Can I just say now to the audience, if you thought that Rockbusters was bad, if you thought that that piece of rubbish earlier about the Chinese hairy kid was bad, I'm suspecting this is going to be really not very good at all. I'm just pointing the finger. What do you think of it? What do you think of his negativity, Kyle? He keeps doing it. I just don't think you should start with the name of the quiz first. This is my only concern. You come up with cheapest chimps and now you're trying to construct a game around that. And I'm not sure it's a proper. Well, okay, what is the game? Let's hear it. Right, it's about a chimp, right? Surprising. Spoke to an expert about him. Who was the expert? Someone at London Zoo. Okay, how many bananas do you think the little chimp that they've got at London Zoo eats a day? Right, how many bananas is a little. Jim, can I call in for this? I'd leave it. I'm just testing it out on Steve because we've already got an email thing going on here. So how many bananas do they eat a day? One chimp per day. How many bananas? Yeah, how many bananas does a chimp eat today? And does this mean that. Because sometimes I've seen them on telly, they peel one, they'll just eat a bit of it and they'll throw it away. We're talking a whole banana. How many bananas does it eat a day? How many bananas do you eat a day? Getting angry. Come on. Well, I'll try and have two if I've got time, but I'm pretty busy. Well, I'll go swinging on your tire. I think a little monkey, tiny little monkey per day. Over the course of a day, I reckon he probably eats 15 bananas. Right, Ricky, what are you going for? Little chimp at London Zoo. But hold on. But presumably they don't only feed it bananas. So it's. So it's. So the question is, it's how many. Bananas does it eat? Come on, how many does it get given? It would eat 15 if it was given 15. But it might be given one slice of banana, 15 oranges, 200 potatoes and some lettuce. How many bananas does it eat? Come on. If I have a guess, five. Yeah, right, it's only one. Yeah, because it only gets given one. Cheap as chimps. What? So it's pretty cheap to have a chimp. Right, I'm on your side now, Steve. I don't understand what happened then. So at the end of it you always shout cheapest chimps. That's the quiz, is it? Oh, play a record. So is that it? Is that. Seriously, is that it? Was that the first instalment of cheapest chimps? Yeah, we'll have to see what the press say about this and, and, and. Why does it only eat one banana? Because it only gets given one banana. I think that's all it wants. No. So you don't even know. You didn't even bother to answer it. It wouldn't just get given one banana and nothing else. It would get given banana and then lots of other stuff like apples, oranges, carrots. It would get given a balanced diet. Cigars. Yeah. So it's just. It's just how many do they give it at London Zoo? I look forward to playing this again. Who is he and what is he to you? We have not had any successful answers on your quiz, Kyle. We've had people who've got. You get a maximum of four duck in a microwave. Yeah. Yeah. Bill with us. Nice. All right. Cheers. And so I'm not talking about. I'm not talking about cheapest chimps. That. That's safe. That's. Yeah. That. That is gonna run. That's really got legs. I'm gonna check the press Monday. I can only assume it's a triumph. Exactly. Another talking and triumph. Yeah. I'm gonna give the prize, if you don't mind, Carl, to Karen and Jeff Gillian. Because they're the only one that got. They were the only couple that got the second answer, which was very, very. But they got four today. But they only got four. Four is the top answer. So should we give the answer, Carl. And then tell us who each one is? Right, so there you go. I didn't know the second one. There's every Chinese kid. So Chris won the last. There she goes. That's George Harrison. No, that's finished. And that's Deacon Blue. Right. So it was. It was the Lars. Yeah. What's the second one? Strokes. That was very tricky. That is hard. George Harrison Ferrari. That's all I could get. It was Ari. Ari Krishna. Yeah. You know, Chinese. Phil Bailey. Chinese war is. Yeah. And Deacon Blue. Real gone kid. We're gone kid. Yeah. There's this airy Chinese kid. Very, very hard. I love the fact that the normal bit of that like. The normal bit is like the well known phrase. There's this hairy Chinese kid. Exactly like nothing happened there. That's normal. There's this hairy Chinese kid as a phrase that offer. In fact, you're right. We must have said that phrase 20 times today. What? When was the last time that was said 20 times? Never. I don't think it's ever been said. Anyway. There's this hairy Chinese kid. I don't. I mean even in China. I Don't think it's at work. It's very definitely not said in China. The prizes they've won. The prizes they won. Red Dwarf DVD Live Forever, the Best of Brit Pop, Marin and Jeff on vhs. And the best of Led Zeppelin. Well done to Karen and Jeff Gillian. I've also seen no proof of this hairy Chinese kid. None whatsoever. Alpine stars burning up on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Steve, you're out of the room there. Carl took a phone call from someone, okay? He's found a cellmate, right? Not a soulmate. I think one day they will be cellmates. Yes. Because he's just like. He loves everything Carl loves. And he was telling Carl stuff and Carl's face was lighting up. He's told him of two Russians, kids in the circus, they're covered in air and their mum tells them off because they're covered in fleas. Carl said, see, that annoys me again. In it, they just. They do something else. And the bloke went, yeah, they should just make money out of being hairy. And Carl went, exactly. And he said, have you heard the one? The three legged juggler? And the bloke went, no, what's that? He went, that annoys me as well, because he thinks they shouldn't have done juggling, they should have done football. Do you know what I mean, though? Steve, what is a three legged juggling? What are you talking about? He's a famous three legged juggler. Oh, he's mega. Yes. He's like the Beckham of wherever he's from. But the other day I was looking in, I don't know, Bizarre magazine or something, right? And there was this fella who. He had no arms. So you saw a picture of him, his job was fixing watches. Did it with his feet. Go on. Well, it's just. Why pick the most hardest job to do when you haven't got any hands? Crush grapes. Or do you know what I mean? Oh, crush grapes. Imagine him being told that he comes into the careers advisory. Now. What do you want to do? Hargreeves? Make watches. Right? Take a look at your arms. Crush grapes, mate. Sorry, you're a grape crusher. Next. Brilliant. Brilliant. I would love you to be a career advisory in some sort of clinic. It'd be brilliant. I love the fact that it annoys you. Here's a man, he's got no arms. He has learned to fix watches with his feet. Yeah. An incredible talent, incredible skill. He's utilizing that brilliantly. That's annoying to you. You are angered by it. I'm only being honest. Now you be honest, right? Your watch is broke. Who would you go to? You're in a rush, you need it fixing. In a rush. Now you need some fresh wine. What's this thing that you've been talking. About, this video Freaks, right? It was a thing that was banned for, like, 50 years. I think it's been taken off again, but I don't know why if it's just been deleted, right? It's a quest. If anyone out there has got a copy of Freaks on DVD or vhs, can Carl borrow it, please? I just. I mean, I almost want to set up a camera to see him watching it. It's absolutely real. They use people in the circus of the time. I think it's the 20s or 30s of the depression. And there's people, there's coneheads, there's a bearded lady, all genuine. There's a bloke they call the Human Slug, who's got no arms and no legs. Carl. And it's just there. And he rolls a cigarette and lights it with his mouth. I think I've seen his brother. Who isn't called the Human Slug, is called the Pillow. Right? How does he make a living? Does anyone want to meet Carl for money? Do you know what we know the. Annoying thing was, right? There was a picture of him. I was gonna put it on. I think I've seen his brother on our website, we put things up like this, right? If you go to ricky.gervais@xfn.co.uk what? You put things like that on my website. It's nothing to do with me. I want people to know that that website is not kept or looked at by me. So what have you put on there? There's a fellow on there who's known as the Pillow and he's. You see, I get a bit worried with things like this because we're not sort of having a go or anything. It's just things that fascinate you. Yeah. And. Yeah, it's a guy. It might. It might be the same sort of thing. What's your. I bet he used to stare at people with goiters, didn't you, when you were little in Tesco's? Or just go. Go to exfolian.co.uk forward slash. Ricky. It is. What's the worst thing you've ever seen on, like, a human face? You know. You know what it is and I want to talk about it. I can't remember. Have you told me yeah. What is it? But go to the. Yeah. Is it the elephant? Now you talked about that. I know, I don't want to talk about it again. Go to the website and see the human pillow. Why is he a human pillow? That's what annoyed me. I thought he was more of a draft excluder. Oh, that breaks all kinds of rules. Buzzclock's harmony in my head now. Things are flying here at xfm. People have called in. There is a video of freaks on the way. Carl's gonna see that within the week. That's exciting. That's exciting for me. Do you know what I mean about our education of Carl? We started off trying to teach him about science and history, and now we just find that he likes pictures of every Chinese kids and women who doesn't know. True. You've got a theory about pictures of freaks, haven't you? As you say. You say. You always bring things up that I don't want to talk about because I'm really worried that people. If you've just tuned in for the first time, it's the first time you hear it. And we're talking about every Chinese kids. Yeah, talking about the human world. Carl, Carl, listen. People don't think that you're taking the piss out of those people. They lump you in with them. Do you know what I mean? They think that you're a freak of nature. So you can say anything you want. Do you know what I mean? Because it's honest, it's from the heart, it's genuine. So don't worry about that. Yeah, but Suzanne was saying last night that I've just. I've got a heart of stone or whatever it is. Why? Because. Because I wasn't crying at Comic Relief. And all I always is to say to her, go, Elephant Man. Let me watch out for 30 minutes. I'll be crying my heart out. Why? Why do you care about that? But not because that. That is more real, isn't it? Right. Think of John Merrick. Sorry, sorry, what? The film starring John Hurt is more real than footage of starving people in Africa. No, but what I'm saying is think about. See, this is why I didn't want to bring it up. Because people are gonna just say we're. Allowed to cry at what? You like, you can't. People can't have you for not crying at someone crying at some house. Imagine that. Like if you've seen the film, you know, his head's old, you know, messed up on that. Yeah, he's getting picked on all the time. Yeah. It'S just really, really sad. Whereas, you know, we try to help. Out, give him a barn and he forgets it. Do you know what I mean, though? He never forgets Rick. Oh, dear. Anyway. Oh, God, we're giving away stuff again. Yeah. Tell me theory about free to have their picture taken. No, I'd leave it. We'll do it next week. Can I tell you what, it's gone quickly. What is it? Right. When he sees a little picture like in his books he's got. He carries round. Oh, yeah, things right? And there's like a feather with a little head with some like able body people, he goes, the only reason he must know, the only reason they got to take that picture, right, was so they could show their mate, say, look at me, the little fellow with a little head. That's what. That's his theory. Yeah. For every picture of a freak, they're being. Steve, let me describe the picture to you. This. This little fellow with a little head, right, Playing on the piano. I've seen it all. His family stood around and mates and that. When have you ever seen a picture of someone playing the piano and everybody wants to be in on it? Doesn't happen. Maybe it was one of those kind of Christmas cards. You could see one of them was like in a rush to go away. He's probably plan to go out. And he was like, but they were taking a picture. So I'll be in it then before I go out. And it was all. It's out of order. Yeah. If you say if you know the one. I do know what you mean, yeah. What about the one in the. When you went down to Cornwall in. That little tub next week. You want to get on, do you? Yeah. Right, we've got a giveaway. Another prize. Yes. You lucky, lucky people. For those of you that haven't seen it and do not have the requisite Â£4.99 to buy it yourselves, you can win on VHS cassette, panned and scanned Billy Elliot. The special edition includes bonus documentary the Billy Elliot Boy. I'd like to see how they really sort of got made that film. Exactly. Well, it's the. It's the. It's the hit film Billy Elliot. And you can win that on VHS because, Carl, I assume you have included yourself in an excerpt from the movie. Taking a scene from the film. Who do you play? Billy. I'm playing the part of Billy. Brilliant. And we'll have a question at the end of that. 1. Brilliant. 2, 3, paddleboard way and go. All right. Just been spin down the Bally. So you don't have to wear. What you looking like that for? What's wrong with Bally? What's wrong with Bally? Yeah, well, what's wrong with it? It keeps you fit and that. What do you think, Auntie Nora think about me doing Bally? I used to go to Bally. There you go. She used to go out of Bally. Used to say I could have been a professional dancer if I'd had the training. Bet you were pretty good, weren't you? Wasn't the time you. Wasn't the time you had wind for five minutes, was it? But you well glided across. Oh, you shut up. What's wrong with bally anyway? Or girls? Not for lads, Billy. Lads do football or. Well, I've done that. Yeah, Boxing or did that for a couple of weeks. So. Wrestling. Wrestling, yeah. Wrestling, yeah. Friggin barley. Well, don't worry about it anyway, just. Is it all right if me mate Wayne stays over tonight? He just wants to sleep over. He's just coming over to. Wayne sleep? Yeah, he just stays over. I'm not gay or anything. He's just. I don't fancy him. I'm not. Yes, you do. I don't. Yes, you bloody well do. What? Just. Just because I want my mate Wayne to sleep over and I've started doing ballet, that. That turns me into a gay man, does it? You haven't seen me Village People album lying around. You're asking for a Hayden. Just joking. Just having a. Just having a laugh. Didn't mean. I've had enough in here. I'm going out. Look, from now on, you stay here. You look after your nana. What's that? Well, there is. What's the question? Powerful. I'd like to know what was the name of the actor that Carl was taking the role of? Does that make sense? That's not grammatically quite right. But anyway, yeah. Who was the. Who was the young lad that Carl was taking the place of there, namely actor, not the character, and just email. In Ricky Gervais@xfm.co.uk you can win yourself. You've got to be fast. You can win yourself a VHS edition of Billy Elliot worth Â£4,99. I'm going to leave the sticker on, which has actually got the price on. Brilliant. Leave that on so you know just what you've got in you. Food. Fighters. No, it's not. Feeder. Feeder. I don't know what I'm doing now. Why have we got to stop? Sorry, we had an argument then. Why have we got to stop? At 5 2. It's just the. The football's on, isn't it? So. So what can we do? We do a link here and then we can play it. We'll play a song, do a little. What about the competition? We got to announce the competition. Well, Steve. Well, I can tell you right now that there's only two people, it would appear, that are interested in a VHS copy of Billy Elliot. That's how mediocre that gift and that prize is, Carl. I don't know if you want to learn from that, but I'm going to give this one to MJ McKay, who has correctly identified that you were taking the part of Jamie Bell, Billy Elliot. So well done. All right, just forward me that and I'll sort that out. We'll get the video. What film are you doing next week? Don't know. I've got. Been out and bought a couple. Got Silence of the Lambs I can do something with. Right. Bought Fight Club, but it's a bit difficult, you know, always. Always open to suggestions and that. So you got any favorite films? What about the 1930s film Freaks? I can't wait. I cannot wait for your Brilliant. That'll be good. Excited about that. Why don't you do a film review of that next week as well? Yeah, well, it depends if the fella, you know, if anyone's got it, just send it in. I'll send it you back once I've watched it. So that'll be good. Next week we'll do. Oh, please, please, please tell me there's gonna be more Cheapest Chimps. Yeah. Oh, thank goodness. We'll see what the press say. We'll see what the press say about that. Looking forward to that. Do you know, like, you're always having a go at my ideas. Yeah. Little, you know, cheapest chimps you've put down. Again, I. I normally come up with these because you don't come up with a competition. Sure, sure. Yeah. He's doing them again. Yeah. Well, cheapest chimps. Mine. You're dissing it. Yep. Rockbuster is one of the most successful competitions ever. Huh. And he means in the world, not just on xfm. Yeah. You put that down. Yep. Right. What are you thinking about? This. Right. I was watching Comic Relief last night, came up with an idea. Right. You get Jono. Okay. John o' Coleman. Yeah. Say Vanessa Felt, you know, maybe, you know, Dawn French, because she'd be around for that. And then get them all in a room for Comic Relief. And what you do, put a cake in front of him. Yeah, Right. And like you, you don't feed them and like they're going, oh, I'd love a bit of that cake. Right. It's called Famine Academy. Right, right. Whilst they lose pounds, they get pounds. Right. What do you think? Play record, Carl? Well, I love it. Again, Again, I love it. Yeah, Again, I love it. Small faces all in the thing, finishing this week's edition of the show. Is that. Is that because Carl would love to see picture people with small faces, Very small faces, yeah. He'd love anything. Would it? Anything. Oh, I'll tell you what, go in the basement of Waterstones or Foils, right, and go down to the. The books with, you know, sort of congenital illnesses. You'll see some brilliant pictures. I'll tell you the hot tip of. The day this afternoon.",

And it's a rather pricey contest, isn't it? Cost a tenner to enter per person and unless you get in the top three, you're not going to get to see your money back.
