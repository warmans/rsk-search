  "text": "All right, here we are then. Oh. Scorpio Rising, Death in Vegas on XFM 104.9. About five past one Saturday. Here we are again then. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. I can't believe our luck. Oh, all right, Carl. All right. Yeah. So what are we doing today, then? Producer. Sorry. I always laugh instinctively when I hear Carl's name and that word. Right. Well, why is that? Because it is. I had to come up with some new features again for this new year. Okay, I'm excited. What have you come up with? We are the backbone of this show, Clark. Yeah, we've come up with some pretty. What's yours first? All right, go on. Right, well, Rockbusters. That's old. That's not a new feature. Yeah, but we'll keep it. Right, so you're just keeping an old feature. Okay. Okay. Now it's an old favorite. I'm sure there's a lot of people that are going, phew. I was worried that he'd lose Rockbusters. Rick, I've just come up with a new idea. Why don't we just play some replica records that we like? There's a new idea for 2003. Yeah. Oh, you know what? We can't, Steve, because the library's out of order. Oh, yeah, the record label. We can't get in there. We're not allowed to get in there. We had to scrounge something from Capital Gold. So anyway, so we got Rockbusters. What are they doing with the library? They put getting some records in that we want to play. Is that their new idea? I know. Let's get some records in. Setting out the. The Gina G. Yeah, yeah. Four Non Blondes. Goodbye. Give that to Foxy. Go on. Sorry, Carl. We'll do. We started doing Edam in 2002. Do we need them? Do we need them? Yeah, we'll continue that. Got a new one out? Yeah. Explain that later. Yeah, yeah. And then the new stuff comes in. Oh, right. As always, I like to sort of get words and tweak them and stuff. Sure. Yeah. So I was thinking of either doing something with. There's a lot of weird rituals. A lot of weird rituals. Yeah. There's weird stuff going on around the world. There is. Yeah. And I was gonna tweak that to Rick Chuls. Okay, right again. Starting with the title, the pun first, then working out what it is. And that's all my stuff. Oh, right. So it's. It's specifically just stuff that goes on, like Rick Chools. It was Most of the weird stuff I've heard about happened to you in Manchester in your early years. Well, in India, apparently, it's good to have a flat head. So the. Again, just flirting, just bordering on the racist, but never really gets there. Always. Well, because there's no. There's no. There's no hate. There's no hate. It's just clubs. It's just stupidity. Yeah, go on. What do you mean? What do you mean? It's good to have a flat. What do you mean? It's good to have a flat in India? We'll talk about it later. That's rituals. So you've hooked a few people, You've hooked a few in. Go on. All right, so we'll have that later. So it's essentially like educating Ricky, only specifically about rituals. Is that. Is that strictly speaking, what it is? I suppose so. But then again, you could say radio is all the same because it's people talking. Okay, Carl, brilliant comeback. Yeah, not all talking nonsense, though. So that's where we're different. Go on. Also right, I like teaching you stuff. Yeah. And you've done well. So what I'm. What I'm thinking is, rather than just touching on a topic, sort of giving you a few bits of information on one. See, this is what I'd like to. Because the last thing you taught me, I remember, was there was a blind girl, she ate her head and she could see. And that's all I got. Yeah. So if you could go into that a little bit more, that would have been educating me. Well, today we're featuring stuff on World War I and 2. Right. Oh, so that's. That's that little title for all this little thing is. What do you think of that, then? What do you think of that, then? Play a record, Rick. I've just thought of a joke. Go on. What's the similarity between Lord of the Rings and this show? They're both rubbish. Watch that, man. David Bowie off a lad. Insane. My favorite David Bowie album. What's yours, Carl? Yeah, that one. That one's good. Brilliant. So, right, we've got Rockbusters coming up. Do you want to say what we've got to give away there? Not really, Rick. Is it really bad? Well, what's the film? What's the featured film? The featured film's not bad, I have to say, actually, you've excelled yourself there. Again, it's just one of those things where I think, what kind of XFM listener would want this particular goodie bag? I know. Before Christmas Car. You've Explained that there is. He's disgusted because he just said, I'll do a lot of work, get these prizes. And I went, no, you didn't. I saw you. He went over to a draw and went, I'll give that one, that one and that one. That's what work you put in. You nicked. You nicked some. There's about 12 Jerry Halliwell videos, one of which we're giving away. It's like you've given it away. Oh, no. Yeah. If you'd like Jerry Halliwell's Body Yoga dvd, then, you know, that's one of the treats you can win. But it does it like, if you notice, if you remember before Christmas, he said that he was giving away a kind of bumper pack of gifts that you might want to wrap up. But obviously Christmas is pass. So I don't know really what your excuse is this. You eat a lot over Christmas, don't you get a bit far? Fair point. Yeah. So, yeah, Jerry Body Yoga is one of them. The recent on dvd. The recent series of readers own pet. Could you give me that reaction again? Well, no, just don't. Just give me that reaction again. Yeah, brilliant. And actually, I have to say this. This isn't bad at all. This is the very best of the Stone Roses cd. Well, you can't knock that. You can't knock that. I'll tell you what, we should. We should play Elephant Stone at some point. Yeah, we'll have that. Go on Madness. I think this is actually tunes from them and not from the musical. Although it is tied into. He went to see that musical. Really? Yeah. On New Year's, you know, it's like on New Year's Day, there's nothing to do. Sure. So you go and see some people doing madness songs. I took Suzanne out for a walk. Right. Yeah. Went round Covent Garden, right past the place where it was on the stage. Door was open, you snuck in. Madness are all right and. Because when you think about it, madness songs are quite sort of musical anyway, aren't they? So you can't. They're quite musical. Do you know what I mean? I thought it was all right. Enjoyed it. Blur the musical would be good, wouldn't it? Blur the musical would be excellent. Yeah. So what, you bought tickets there and then and just went in. They're not selling, are they? It was fair. It was fairly quiet because we only paid the lower price and we got upgraded for free. Nice. So you enjoyed that, did you? I'd loved it. And would anyone like to come on stage with Us? Yeah, the little bald fella. Yeah, go on. I'll give it a go. And what home are you from? What are you doing tomorrow? Well, I'm going. No, you're coming here tomorrow. Come here tomorrow. Is it not. Is he not doing well? That's as disappointing. I don't. I don't know. I mean, it was New Year's Day, so maybe that's why it was quiet. Okay, well, if. If anyone hasn't seen this or didn't. Receive it for Christmas, said all is quiet on New Year's Day. Carl. Yeah. Also we've got the giveaway Minority Report by Steven Spielberg with Tom Cruise, which is on vhs. Good rit. Roaring sort of film. It's not bad. That's probably the best thing we're giving away, but as I say, we can always leave somewhere. If you don't, I'm arresting you for the future murder of Sarah Marks. Brilliant. That's the sort of excitement and drama you'll be getting in it. It's not bright. I did. I got that off Paul Anderson. He said it's something to watch over Christmas. So you've actually watched this already? Yeah, all right. I've rewound it. That's probably added to it though, isn't it? It's touched by the great man himself, Carl Pilkington. And it's all right. I'd say it's worth. Worth a watch. Yeah. Yeah. Do you want to give us a quick film review? Just give it a wipe down there. Maybe some tripe on it. Bit unrealistic. Sure, yeah. Genius. A man who can fight, who finds people, who can see into the future. Whereas our house, that really happened. Yeah. God. Anyway, prizes giving away. What. What's the competition? We're still doing Rockbusters. Oh, we'll look forward to that. Do that in like 15 minutes. I need a bit of Coldplay first. I'm doing honestly. Really? Oh, beautiful. Coldplay. The scientist, I think. Think they wrote that about Carl? Yes, on XFM. 104.9. Right. I'm Ricky Gervais. Steve Merchant. Carl Pilkington. Can I just ask Carl how he got on over Christmas? Because the last time I spoke to him, you hadn't bought a present for your girlfriend. I had to say. I was on 10 hooks all Christmas. Well, you changed it. After that show, I felt bad, even though I shouldn't have done because. Because you hadn't bought your girlfriend the Christmas. Yeah, but I said to you, I booked a table at a hotel in Covent Garden, had Christmas dinner there. Which was nice, right? It's good food and everything. Didn't feel like enough to me. Well, then I went out and treated some stuff and then. No, no, no, the. A couple of days before Christmas, he went. I took Suzanne to that hotel we're going to go to for Christmas dinner. We had tea and cakes and I went, oh, you treated her? He went, no, she paid for it. But I was just showing her what it was going to be like. That was her extra treat. She paid for it. I love that. Brilliant. Yeah, well, it was a day. It was like 150 quid for a meal for two, which is pretty dear. So I'm not gonna buy a cakes as well. I love that. All right, Love everything you want. You pay for your own pudding. I'm not mental. Yeah, so. Yeah, but. So you. You did. You treated her to some other stuff. Some bits and bobs she bought. She chose them and you paid for them. What, the presents? Yeah, well, you chose them and she paid for them. But, you know, it's the bill of the cats. I got them on the way home that Saturday. Well done. Well, just some bits. It might be personal, Steve. Well, I don't care. Just some bits. Leave out the personal bits. What, what bits? Just little things. And then yesterday, right, a monkey wrench. And a new washer for the shower. Yeah. Some recordable CDs that you need for your job. Now, when you gave those prisons to her, did her face light up? Right, I don't want to tell you what they were, right, but she wasn't that impressed. You're gonna tell us what they were now tell us what they are. You even know what they are? She told you on Christmas Day. Hold on, wait a minute. But it doesn't matter what they are. It does matter what they are, Carl. It's you, mate. Of course it doesn't matter. Oh, God, we just remembered. Yeah, right, but don't. There's no need. I've got to tell him. Carl. I really want your permission because I don't want to be a. You know. I know it's not, but we know it's not that embarrassing. It's really quite sweet. Yeah, but in a way, right, the way I look at it is, right, Christmas, even when I was a little kid, right, it's not. Please let me tell him, Carl. Well, let me just tell you first, though, let me tell you why I didn't go all out on the old present front. Justify yourself. Right, first of all, I've covered it up since then anyway, right, with that present because I bought some shoes yesterday and she did say, I'll give you the money for them, but when I get home, I said, it's all right. I said, you can have them. So not only did I buy her some food on Christmas Day, I got her shoes. She's probably had a ton of these. Feel like a horse. Yeah. It's sort of like, yeah, there you go, there's your shoes, there's your food. Right, Bed down. See you later. Yeah, but what I'm saying is she's. Done fed and clothed. Yeah. Did you comb her hair? She's done well this year, right? So I think she's done well this year. It's like you're a single parent, you've got a council estate with a smack problem and you still managed to buy some Lego. When I was a kid, it wasn't about what you got. I remember one year when I was about 8. It's gonna make me cry at this. No, it's not. I'm just saying the way it is, right? I woke up at about 4 in the morning and I was like, oh, what? Forgot? And I couldn't sleep. I was not on edge. It's the excitement of Christmas, innit? It's like, oh, what's wrapped up? I need to know. And it's the fact that people are saying, no, you won't know until tomor. Yes. That annoys you and winds you up. Okay. So I got up at 4 in the morning, opened me presents and then went, right, I know now. I went back to bed, had a great sleep. Yes. Right. So it's nothing to do with the excitement of what you get. It's the excitement of not knowing what you've got. And then what happened when you got up to go down with a. Hang on. So what you're saying to me is that you could wrap up a brick because the thrill of Christmas is in hoping and it's being excited about what it is, not the actual gift itself. Yeah. Is that. Is that what you did? Did you get a brick? No. Let me tell you now what he got. He got her a present, right? And she said, church came. I said, yeah, he got me. It was. It was an industrial sized packet of condoms. It was a joke gift. It wasn't even a joke. I went home that Saturday afternoon, pass boots. So Max Summit in a. They were on like value, right? You passed them. Were they used. You passed all the other stuff. Passed the lovely vanity cases. Yeah, yeah. The foot spas. Yeah. Hold on, hold on, hold on. How Much are these, love for? 100.4.99. Yeah. Do I get them reduced if I buy in bulk? So how many did you buy? What was it? I don't know. Probably about 100. Right, okay. And is she allowed to use those with anyone? Did wrap them. Can she just go out? Well, you don't need to wrap. They're already wrapped, aren't they? Oh, and then what did she say when she opened them? Wait, wait, what is. All right, play a record and we'll. Come back to this. You're worse than my father. That's genius. Made famous, of course, by Jimi Hendrick. That's all along the Watchtower, as Originally. Done by Mr. Bob Dylan on XFM. 104.9. So, Carl, just. Just take us through the moment where you gave this gift. You went into Boots, right? You thought, all right, 100 condoms. Brilliant. Okay. Did you wrap it up? I don't know if it was 100. Probably 80. Right, okay. Yeah. You don't want to go mad, do you? Wrap them up. I'm just. I, you know, I'm just resting easy, knowing that he's not trying to breed. So I got her them. I got her Grease on dvd because she's always watching that. Yeah, right. Yeah. So just think of when her mum said, what did Carl get you? Some condoms and Grease? I was just so glad he said on dvd. She was surprised anyway, right? Because. Yeah, I bet she was. No, when. When she got. She was thinking, like jewelry. That showed her. That surprised you, hasn't. All right, so hang on, wait a minute. You thought it was a holiday, didn't you? Yeah. Look at your face. You don't know me at all. So, hang on. So did you give these on Christmas Day? Right. What happened is she got in from work that Saturday, right? And I said, look under the tree. Knock her door. At least it's Christmas. I'm gonna get a little bit. I said, look, you got some stuff under the tree. So did you give her a sugar lump? Right. She was really chuffed with that. But she said she was a bit puzzled because I didn't know we had any wrapping paper, right? So I ended up using wallpaper. You didn't take it off the wall, though? You had to. No, it was some leftover. Right. So she said, why have you used wallpaper? I said, well, I didn't have any paper and you were getting in in a bit and I wanted you to have a surprise. So she said, can I have a few of them? I said, the present. He thought, right, I've got the right thing. Yeah. Right. And then Christmas Day, I said, no, don't get carried away. It's nothing really good, you know. We said we weren't going to buy each other much, so there you go, open them. Yeah, go on. Can I just ask, had you received your present from her yet? Yeah. So what had you received? What did he have? Had some shoes. Nice. Right. Getaway game for PlayStation. Nice. I'm just totting up the value of. The value of those and just also. Think about how much fun and pleasure you get from them. Yeah. Although, of course, condoms. I can see the appeal. I'll also add to that bit. 150 quid for a meal. If you're gonna start totting up 100. 150 quid for a meal. I bought some shoes. 72 quid. Yeah. That was after the event, though. It doesn't matter. All right, so you've received these, dare I say it, thoughtful and nice gifts. You handed over the box of condoms. They were wrapped up. She unwrapped them. Go on, take us through it. Walk us through it. Well, it's not. It's not something you play with on Christmas morning. Oh, God. Oh, right. But when she opened. Well, I wrapped him twice as well. So she thought it was something really good. Extra protection. Right. So she thought it was somewhat. Really good. And then. So the disappointment would be double. Oh, yeah, go on. Yeah. Then she just opened it and went. Oh, yeah. What's on the telly? What an ungrateful woman that is. Fancy not wanting. I told her a box of economy condoms from Boots. I said to her about the thing about, you know, it's all about the surprise and that, innit? Yeah. You explained that to her? Yeah. What, after she'd unwrapped it? Yeah. She was all right about it. Yeah. She understood Rick, you know, I suggested to him that he buy his girlfriend a gift. I'm worried I've done more damage to the relationship by suggesting that than if he had just forgotten. Next time, you've gotta go shopping for her yourself, Steve. I think I might do. You've bettered go shopping for her yourself. I'm glad it's all over, though. It's mental. Yeah. It annoys me. The whole thing annoys me. And she knows that as well. Yeah. She still insists on having Christmas once a year. Well. Well, you know. No, but. Well, anyway, what did you get? I can't think what you. What you bring to the relationship, Carl. I don't know what it is. She's Getting from you in this relationship. It's like she's doing. We know. 80 times. I love it. You're brilliant. I know what she's getting. He's the. He's the. He's the. No, he's not thoughtful. No, he. No, but he's thoughtful. He's the best he can do with the brain he's got. Do you know what I mean? Right. He's doing his best. He's absolutely doing his best. There's no. He's working at the limits of his power. You know what I mean, though? He's done as well as he can with what he was given. Sure. Yeah. And that's. That's admirable. Yeah. It's like. I think he's done better than you'd expect. I bet his teachers didn't even think he'd get this far. Do you know what I mean? What, Find a girl. No. Yeah, A job. A girl. Do you know what I mean? Clothing himself. He's done really well. What do you think, Carl? You think you've done well? I think I've done all right compared to some of my mates. What are they doing now? Probably not that much. Do you know what I mean? Mrs. Matthews said I wouldn't be an Iflyer. I think I'm doing all right. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? I have a holiday every year. Got somewhere to live and that. Yeah. Got a new flat, haven't you? Yeah. So. So where are they, then? The condoms? Are they. Did she show them to her family and friends? No. Take them into work. Look. What? Calm. I'm surprised she told Ricky. Actually, I was a bit disappointed in that. Ye. Because I didn't go shouting. Well, she was so excited, Carl. Clearly. She was just so pleased and proud. All right. Playing record. We'll come back quick. No, that's it now. A new dying of a morning after leaning back on my chair in a greasy spoon cap. No. Oh, no. That's it. Streets. Don't mug yourself. Xfm 104.9. Ricky Gervais. Steve Merchant. Carl Pilkington.

They've pressed it in their garage. Yeah. You can hear the mum in the background going, what are you doing, Mom? Recording this for XFM 104.9. Ricky Jamaica Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Carl, what have you got for us? I'm just thinking, the irony is we're the only people on this station, I think, who play their own records, aren't we? I know there's loads of people who do. Rubbish. Sean Kennedy plays what he wants. Yeah, he's on 3:00 in the morning. No one's asked. Zoe on Drive, she plays some stuff. What do you mean? What does she play, fat boy? It's not a remix, you know. I won't say you're a spy. Christian plays some of his own. Does he? Yeah. So, yeah, they're probably novelty songs, aren't they, by you? Right, listen. Right, yeah, New Year and all that. He's great. Any Rock Bosses is on the way. We're getting some good stuff coming in. I have to say, I'm amazed. Every answer I've had so far has been correct. I listen to the clues. I've got no idea. And I know you, Carl. I spend time with you. I know how listeners. Well, of course, they're the same as Carl. Of course. They've got the same mindset. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, so what did you do for New Year instantly? Well, I met. I cocked it up a bit. Joking. You're joking. You're joking, mate. Go on. I went and booked. You caught the wrong day. Booked a table at a restaurant that was shut, Right? What? I booked a table at a restaurant and the one that I called, it wasn't the one. The call had been diverted. So Suzanne said, call them up and see what they're serving. Right. Because I forgot to do that when I booked the table. Right, that's great. Anyway, because the thing is, right, it's a restaurant in Covent Garden, but they've got one in Victoria. But when they answered and they said, no, no, no, no, Victoria, I thought that was the person who was answering the phone. Do you know how some people say the name? Right, right. So then when I called them up. And said, what, you thought he sounded a bit funny? Right. So I'm confused, Carl, but probably not. It was a branch of a. He doesn't want to give the restaurant away, so he phoned it up. There's one in Common Garden. They answered the phone. No, no, no, no, no, no, they aren't. They said, no, no, no, Victoria, why. Can'T we do the restaurant? I don't know why it's not. Neither are we scared that, like, are you scared people are going to sort of see you in there? Because it's your regular horn. No, it's just that, you know, you got paid for stuff, haven't you? Right. I mean, it's okay. Anyway, so you've mentioned it before New. Year, but it's not. So did you go all the way. To the restaurant to find out that it was closed? No, no. What happened? Is that the name of the restaurant again? Right. The restaurant's called Christopher's. They've got one in Covent Garden, they've got one in Victoria. He phoned up, he went to book. It's a lovely restaurant, I've been there often, I recommend it to him. He phones up, he said, can I have a table for new. They said, no problem, sir. Right. And then said, oh, you better call up, see if they see if they've got any haddock on the menu. And he went, hello. And they went, hello, Christopher's. Victoria went. Victoria. I went, yeah. He went, oh, no, that's it. So then I just said, no, forget it, I'm not going all the way over there. So I cancelled it, right. So then I called up Suzanne said, look, I've made an error. The place we were going to is shut. Was she surprised to get north? So we're not going. So she said, oh, try some other places. And I did. They were all booked up, right. I was fed up. Anyway, I ate New Year, it's always like this, isn't it? So I said, look, you know the. Common factor in all these stories. You hate Christmas, you hate birthdays, you hate New Year, it is you, yeah. So I said, I'll sort something out. So I went to Tesco. Leave it with me. Went to Tesco's. Boots were shut. A lovely plate of condom. Did you just stay in and play with her birthday? Blowing them up. Look, I've done some balloons. It was. I think we did stay in. And I watched that thing that, you know, under Greatest Moments, which was annoying me. Did you see there was a nudist on it? You know how I feel about them. Yeah. Did you see a man with two knobs? There was a man with two knobs on it and a nudist who just like wanders about the house. But it said, he said, and when he visits people, I was thinking, oh, go lets him visit, but he must go there with trousers on and go, hello, lovely to see you. Go. Just pop all these off or. Not really, no. And I'll tell you what, what annoyed me the most. They had a white sofa. If you were a nudist, you'd get. You get a darker one. So anyway, right, so we ended up watching that. That annoyed me. And then I was tired by about 11 and I said, oh, let's go to bed. And she said, you can't. And that annoys me, the fact that because it's New Year, you gotta stay up and it's like, well, why can't we just. You should bring it forward. So in case you want a quarter to 10. Quarter to 10? Well, you stay up and it's like my eyes were dead heavy and I was like, I wanna go to sleep. So just stay up. And then it's midnight and you go up in your ear, then you go to bed. Yeah, well, not everyone, Carl. Some people have a little party, so. It'S all the way down. Yeah. Are you 86 years old? Do you ever enjoy. You never seem to have any fun, Carl. This is what disappoints. This is what worries me. I feel like you're gonna die. You're here. You're here, Carl, with us too. We've got three, as I was just saying to Steve, three of the greatest comedy minds ever in one room. And Steve pointed out, since the goodies. True. Do you know what I mean? It should be party central. Yeah. So anyway, right, so this is when I spent time thinking of new ideas. Right. So that's when I came up with. What did I come up with? Rituals. Yeah, this is about. It's good to have a flat in India, just. Yeah, it's good to have a flat head in India. Is that it? Well, what they do is they put wood around your head and sort of clamp it. And the flatter edge you've got, apparently the more attractive in some part of India. Can't remember. So that's like a. That's a ritual. I don't know where to start with this. No, we'll leave it. Leave it. We will be doing that while we've done it. That's. So that was the first one, wasn't it? We've also got doing Edom, which we've carried on from last year, which is finding out, you know, what animals we need in the world, which ones we can get rid of. I'm talking to experts and that, finding that out. But we're doing Rockbusters. That's on the way. We're getting emails in and what do you think of that, then? What do you think of that, then? Of course. I love this, that he treats this show like it's a checklist for what he's got to pack for holiday. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's easy to go. Sun cream. Yeah. It's all like. It's done. Look at his face. No, but I try and come up with stuff that people will remember and go, that's interesting. I'll tell my mates that in the pub. Another one I think they're doing. Do you know the film around the world in 80 days? Around the world in Aitagervays? And what I do, I give you, like, little things, like little bits of information about countries so that if you go, you go, like, don't want to go there. It's this terrible thing to say and I apologize. I can't think of the PC word for it, but I think car is slightly retarded. Yes. I was just gonna think. I was just thinking the same. Yeah. Yeah. Is there something we can do about that? Just play a record? Just keep the. Could we get ourselves registered as a charity? I think so. I'm sorry about that. Is it skipping? It's skipping all over the place. Embarrassing. That's Papa Garcia, Natalie Nusy, released this week, but the CDs all scratched. I can only apologize. Carl's a little bit disappointed. It's all. And the thing is, do you know what annoys me about that? It's something that's not in our control that's ruined the show. Yeah. Because the show is so slick and, you know, I mean, we put a lot of work into this and a lot of effort. Sure. And then just a little bit of dust. Well, I know I frustrated you because you are a perfectionist when it comes to this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then that in excellent. Badly Drawn Boy, Born again on XFM 104.9. I was just. Sorry. I was just looking to see if that's a new single. It looks like it probably is. If that's of interest to you. It's a new one. Yep. So, first of our regular features with Carl, we've got Rockbusters that's rolling. There's people coming in. They're getting them. Right. I don't. I don't understand myself. Well, as ever, Rick, you'll be. You'll be amazed and confounded. So I don't know the answer and I haven't looked at the answers. I. I just like that mom moment. It's like when you go down Christmas and you're excited about a present and it's like some condoms. I love that. That moment. Yeah. I don't know how he's gonna top that next year. I don't know. He's gonna top that. All I can Think of is some corn plasters. Right. It's all right, love, the batteries are included. Got you a pumice stone. Right. Now, do we need them? Do we need them? It's something we started a few weeks ago. We're always talking about animals and insects and that. And it's like, you know, if you took an animal out of the world, would we have problems? Right. Would it make any difference? Yeah, would it make any difference? We did jellyfish last time, didn't we? Yeah, we sorted that out. The woman said we've got to keep them. We do need them because turtles eat them. Yeah. So I've moved on. Octopus. Do we need the octopus? Yeah. Let's find out. I'm working through a load of animals, right, that I'm finding out whether we need them or not. Right, right. Because, like, jellyfish, to me, I'm a bit puzzled by them. I don't really know why we need jellyfish. And I spoke to some experts. Eat them. What? Turtles eat them. Yeah, I know, but do we need turtles? Do you know what I mean? It goes on and on, doesn't it? Well, you know, I mean, I might get to that a bit, but I need to sort out the animals first. I've got a lot. So the thing is, I've left the jellyfish. We know we need them. Right. So octopus. Yeah, Right. I know they're pretty brainy. Incredibly brainy. A story that I heard. I don't know if it's true, but there was some science lab somewhere, right, where they had some octopus in it and they had some crabs and at night the octopus was like getting a bit bored on its own in the dark and that. And they sort of come alive in the dark, don't they? Yeah, they like the dark. Yeah. On. The octopus had, like, had its eye on the crabs and at night, when it's dark, it was getting out of its little cage, crawling along the floor, getting in the crabs cage, getting them out and eating them. I don't doubt it. We put jam jars with the lids on with crabs in and they'll open the jam jar and. You're joking. Yeah. Even I sometimes struggle with them. Yeah. We don't do it. You don't do it really, really tight, but. All right. So they're not that clever, then? Well, they would if they were strong enough, they'd open it, but just not that strong. Oh, that's mad. Right. I also know that if they get hungry, they. They eat their own legs. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They death. Well, I don't Know, I don't really know. Yeah. They don't live very long. They can squash themselves into small jugs. Oh yeah. I think going to demi John through the narrow neck and that. Why? Why do they need to do that? Because they're the sort of crevices and holes that they're hunting for crabs and things through. So would they be better if they were smaller? Do you know what I mean? I don't know. I really don't know. Yeah. But octopus then, if. If Noah said to you, you know, we. We're having a clear out. Yeah. We've got too many animals to look after in that, in the sea. Taking up too much room. Right. Do we need them? I think there's other less useful things in the season. Octopus, limpets, they could go. Limpets? Yeah. They just sit on a rock and do nothing for 50 years. But they're not getting in the way then. How big are they? Not very big. Yeah, you see, I might come round to them but I never think, oh, you know, I'm sick of seeing these limpets. Whereas octopus, you know, crawling about, opening jam jars and that. You'd never see them though. They're really rare. We get two or three quarter year. It's a, you know, it's quite amazing. Do we need them? Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll just have to keep them then. I love that, that Carl can confuse a scientist. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because all systems of logic break down. I know even the scientist was going, oh, get rid of limpets. Who was that guy? I think his name was Chris. And where was he from? In place called Megavisi, where I went one year, me. And is he a. He's a scientist, is he? I think he's got a fish shop or something like that. He's got a fish shop, like an aquarium type place. Oh, right. So that's a fish shop. Fish and chip shop. It wouldn't be fast. A winkle stall. He's got winkle store. Paul Hara. Yeah. That's an expert. Oh dear. What. What have you learned from that then? Well, the. We don't know whether they're deaf or not because the scientist, the bloke in the chip shop couldn't confirm it. They eat their own legs. Look at that. Bit weird. They eat their own legs. Eat their own legs. If they get hungry. Right. And they grow back, don't they? I think so, yeah. If, if you, if you eat one, they don't grow back. Yeah. And yeah, you can put them in, in little jars and that. If you wanted to yeah. It's just a bit weird, isn't it? It's like. No, but, you know, like, you know, people have a go about being cruel to animals and that. But what he was saying there is, right, what they've watched an octopus do. They've. They've got hold of a crab, right, so that'll be being stressed out because it's out of the water. Yeah. They've then stressed it out even more by putting it in a jar, which he didn't like. And then an octopus is crawling about on the jar. Yeah. And the crab knows that the octopus wants to eat it, so then it's having more frets. Yeah. Because of that. And then they let the octopus eat it. Yeah, I think that's. That's pretty. Do we need crabs? See them next week. Yeah. Well, I want to sort out snails first. What's your pitch with snails? What do you know about snails? I know that bats eat them. They can sleep for 13 years. Right. Can you believe that? He said to me, he said to me, snails can sleep for 13 years. And I went, right. He went. Thing is, though, if it was a scientist and he was, you know, he was looking at it and he put it in a quiet place, it might well doze off. He said it wouldn't be the same if it lived on the streets. And then we went on to a whole thing about homeless. He wants to do a game show with celebrities, being homeless for a week. What do you think? Actually, I've got to say, that's not bad. It's not bad, is it? No. Do you know how, like, Lenny Henry went to the jungle? Yeah. Right. And you've got. You've got. Who else did it? Made slippers out of a bra, right? So I'm thinking, like, get a celebrity and say to him, no, just because. I'll tell you why, right? I'll tell you why all this came about when I was walking back from that Christmas meal that I bought my girlfriend for 150 quid. Lest we forget, right? I was walking down Mortimer street and there was an homeless fellow there and it was like, oh, you know, it's really, really bad. But the weird thing is it was about, I don't know, probably about eight. Eight o'clock? No, about nine. Right. And he was asleep. And I just thought, do homeless people ever think, do you know, I think I'll have an early one tonight. Right. That's. That's what got me thinking. It's a bit weird, the whole lifestyle of it. The fact that he had an early life. What if it's a bit weird that he's sleeping? Sleeping not in a home, but on the street. No, it's just that if. Interesting. If I was interesting, I'd probably stay up quite late because it's not nice. Do you know what I mean? What are you talking about? Just being homeless isn't a good thing, is it? No. People forget how bad it is. Yeah, right, but surely sleeping gets you out of reality. They sleep because they're tired. They can't sleep very well, so they need all the sleep they can get. Yeah, but sleeping's nice if you've got a nice big bed. What, you think they can go, I'll stay up, I'll go to bed at 2, I'll go straight to sleep and I'll pop up at 8, the alarm clock goes off. Well, it's just what I was thinking, right. So I was thinking how bad it is and it's, you know, especially this time of the year, you know. Yeah, it's terrible. It's the. It's the worst thing. And to sort of give it some publicity and get a bit of help behind it. Get celebrities. Someone like Phil Mitchell, maybe. Yeah. Of EastEnders, who's a big fella. He can look after himself. Put him in a shop doorway, have some cameras set far away in a building or something. Yeah, they can film him. And it's up to him how he raises money for food to eat. He could sign autographs. Well, they wouldn't know him, though, would they? Because you never look. You get. You get. What's her name? G. Porter. Yeah. Gabby Roslin. Right. Yeah. Narinda from Big Brother. Yeah. Who else would do it? I got a game show ide. I reckon I do it. I got a game show idea called on the Game and what happens is you get the R. Sugar Cane by sonic youth on XFM 104.9. Ricky Ray, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Go on, Carl. What. What's. What's next? Are you gonna do your war feature? War. What is it called? What do you think of that, then? You do that now. I just. It annoys me a bit. Right. Because we said before Christmas that we'd come back with new stuff. Yeah. Gave you a title to work on. Not Rickidiculous. Right. You came in today, I said you sorted it out. You say, no, Steve, you're having a go at me for getting. Wanting to get music out of the library for you. You haven't got any new ideas. Sure, but you're dissing mine. I'm not dissing yours. Well, I'm a massive fan of them. Good vibe off you. That's very harsh. I just asked you, when were we gonna have war? Do you think of that? I'm a big fan. I'm excited. Well, it's not that good, to be honest with you. Well, I disagree. It sounds brilliant. Right. Well, it's. It's a bit of a tweak of Educating Ricky. Just some information on. On wars. Yeah. World War II. World War II. All right. The world champion chess player. He helped someone out in the war. It's the detail I like, you know, it's nearly a history program, isn't it? I was watching those repeats of the World at War. Yeah, they were on in the mornings, you know, incredibly, they've got nothing on car. Did you write a lot of that David Sharma series? He was able to use his skills that he has to play chess because apparently chess is all about probabilities of, like, where, you know, where a piece will be put right. And they got him in and they said, can you help us out? He said, yeah. And he said, right, where should we. Like, Hitler has just moved his queen. He sent in a bishop that ran diagonally through the troops, knocking him over. Sorry, wait a minute, Carl. So they got a chest. Sorry, that's it? Well, yeah, it's just like, oh, what do you think of that again? That's not a story. But it angers me that he says that I'm down on the ideas where that. I mean, that's beginning to shape up as quite interesting. I thought you were going to tell me which battle or which event was you. Not a battle, but which bit of you. World War II, like the Middle bit. Six years worth. Yeah, well, probably about a bit. Guessing. Guessing. Well, all right, yeah, there is a bit of guesswork, but it doesn't. But that could have been an interesting thing if you told me it had an impact on the Normandy lands things. Do you go, bloke wants help, chest. Oh, use that and run away from the computer or run out of the bookshop. I read the first line where I get enough information. I just think, what do you mean. You read the first line where you get enough information? Imagine if you were someone's defense lawyer and he was like, he's on death row. I don't think he did it. Yeah, I read the first. I didn't read the file completely. In a hotel in Texas. Right, go on. It's enough, it's enough. It's enough. Yeah. They always take ages on deciding where to go, it's just like, you know. But there's a better. I don't know what he's saying now. I don't know what. I don't know what you're talking about. I actually don't know what you're talking about. Play chess, it take ages to make the move. So I'm just thinking there's probably a quicker way. What, than finding where a boat is? Than getting a chess player in. I don't know. I don't know what you mean now. Are you talking about battleships now? They should have got an extra battleships player in. Yeah, yeah. What? But I can't forget that one. Or someone. No, no, no, no. I'm not being funny, but what is that? What are you telling me? There someone who's really good at risk? Yeah. Cluedo. Another fact. That's enough then, is it? Well, they use expert Cluedo players, but the police use it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. If ever there's a murder in a country house. Do you think they use that old Chinese fella on the front of Mastermind? Mastermind? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. For logic problems, the Enigma code was broken by top mastermind players. Had a guy who's had a couple of rounds of Yahtzee in. Second fact about the war for engineering, they use a lot of Jenga players. Absolutely. Whenever they want. Will the building collapse? I don't know. Let's pull this. Let's see. If they wanted to identify. What are you doing? If they wanted to identify spies. Bring me the champ. Have guess who. Was it a woman with glasses? No. Right. Is it Bernard? Right, Carl. Sorry, go on. Another war fact. You're saying it's rubbish, but look, you love that. Yeah. The first bomb that was dropped on Berlin. Yeah. It didn't kill a person, but it killed an elephant. I think that's true. That is true. Right, okay. And the last one. Is that all you know about that? See, that's interesting, isn't it? But no, it's not, though. No. Because, I mean, listen, most people go, oh, what was the elephant doing there? Did it land in a zoo? Was it a pet? Was it a lost elephant? Did they aim at the elephant? How did they kill it? Was it not his favorite elephant? Did it then have one ball? Yeah. I mean, these are the things, you know. Why didn't he catch it with his trunk? Did it have an effect on German morale? Yeah, yeah. Oh, that's elephant is good. Put poor Jumbo. I don't want to fight anymore. Jackson XFM 104.9. Need some adverts now. CHEERING BREAKS Painkiller on XFM. Carl's getting a little bit stressed, aren't you? No, I just. I just, you know, got to keep focus, got to keep the show good and that. Yeah. You know, and in the new year, the idea was. Come up with some good, snappy stuff. Yeah. And today I just think it's been a mess with you, to be honest. I mean, this is the sort of thing I'd prefer to do after the show as a producer. Yeah. But I think it's a discipline problem. Is it because I just put Sellotape on your head? Well, that. That's a bit to do with it, but just, you know, let's. Let's just focus. I didn't put it. When there was any hair on your eyebrows, I put it across your forehead. Right, what do you think of that, then? Yeah, we've got one more bit left. Brilliant. One more fact. The French, right, when they were at war. David. Sh. I just imagine him just introducing. Amazing. Which. Which war was this? It was still the World War I or 2. Go on. It's 50. 50. Go on. Yeah, yeah. World War II, what the French did. Everyone needs a code. Everyone needs a code. Yep, a code. When you. When you're in the army, it's a Disney song and, you know, to sort of give the go ahead if you want to go into battle and stuff. Okay, right, so do you know what theirs was? Go on. Do you? Yeah, yeah, I know what it is. So what was the French code for what? To sort of say. Right, yeah, go on. But they had more than one on this day. But I don't know what day it is. What am I thinking of? What was the battle? What was the. Okay, so. All right, look, he's genuinely confused that I've asked this question, right? It was. No, no, no. If you ask me a question, ask me the question correctly. What was the. What was the code for battle? Battle during what battle? World War II. No, that's not a battle, that's a war. Yeah, it wasn't a war. Yeah. I don't know what to do. He confuses people. All right, okay. What was it, Carl? What was there. Yeah, what are you thinking of? Right. John's got a mustache. What are you talking. That was. Was a code that the French used, you know, like. I mean, I just think it's a bit daft, right, because you could come up with that by mistake. Yeah, yeah. Two French blokes talking in the trenches and they see. They See, a major walk past and they go, look, John's got a mustache. And they all go and go, no, I was just talking. What are you talking about? Well, the way. I don't think that's a good code. I'm not. I don't believe it is the code. No, it is. Seriously. And what. Would it have been said in French? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Guessing. Guessing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, but what you see, I can't even be bothered. What. What are you saying, Carl? Because he's not a very good code. Do you know, like, we've talked in the past about, you know, things you don't see, and I said, an old man eating a Twix, you have to use that. That wouldn't. That's safe because no one is ever going to see a man having an old. You know, an old man having a Twix. What do you mean? Well, use that as a code. Don't use a saying, John's got a mustache. That could crop up. It's like the walls kicked off. Why that happen? Well, I said John had a mustache. Oh. Do you think folks would never be saying, john's got a mustache? Why would they? Because back then they were fashionable. He nearly makes sense, doesn't he? I assume it would have been Jean. Yeah. No, probably John and I. How would this. How would this code have been? I mean, who would have announced it? I read it like that, Steve. That's what was on the Internet. This is a code that was used. John's got. Don't be angry with me. I know, but you're always asking questions. Because I'm interested in history. Yeah. No, it's genuine. You genuinely interest in bloke calm. We like to know. I'd like to film you secretly. You know, like they do. Like nature watch. When they put it in a. Like a, you know, I mean, the badges sort of thing, and they just. They just watch it. I'd like to see what you do. Potter around. Like, I wish I could download the music in your head, because it'd be. And you see something where you go. And then you read that and you go. And you write it down and that's what comes out. John's got a mustache. Imagine the French, right, For their battle cry, for their battle code. To know it's going ahead, they're going over the top is. You never see an old bloke eating a Twix. Imagine that. Yeah, but they. All these things are things that I think in my head. Keep them in there. Do you know, like, before before, when I was talking about going out on, you know, Christmas Day, having a meal on the way back, seeing a homeless person. Yeah. And then I think, God, that wouldn't be good. I know. TV show. You can think of things like that. When I saw the Honest Fellow. Then I got talking to Suzanne about when I had to sleep in my car. What do you mean? Go on, let's play a record and come back to any sleeping. Oh, my God, I can't wait. I was watching last night on cable TV, 1987's Amazing Sign of the Times. Prince in concert film. It was dynamite. I thought to myself how brilliant he is. It reminded me of the gig I went to see last year. He played this tune. It's from the album Parade. Okay. I don't want to discuss whether or not Princess Prince is acceptable on XFM or whether he's a genius. He's a genius. That's the end. That's the end of the discussion. Play the tune. He's done about it. I remember I was going to tell you. I was on the way here, you know. Do you remember, John? He's got a mustache now. I can't believe it, lads. No, it's not on. It was. Look at your face. The elephant did die. Yeah. No, I believe that. Yeah. Sometimes it snooze in April. From the lovely Prince. Brilliant. From the album Parade. He doesn't always have to get up and have a rockabout. He can just sit there at the piano. You can't argue with that. After the break, Steve, a brand new feature I've just done. That's Rick Ridiculous. That's Rick Ridiculous. You see, you say Ricky Gervais doesn't put any work into the show. He's just done that. I'm telling Carl some amazing facts from the world of science, nature, politics. Four are real. One is absolutely Ricky, Dicky, Nicholas, Cat Stevens from Catchblood at 4. Album sitting. Little interesting fact for the nerds. We got it down to two songs to do this intro. Music to the Office. It was that one and Handbags and Glad Rags. We went for hamburgers. Interesting. It is a fascinating fact. Except, of course, we want. I still feel we should use that one. Except we couldn't because Cat Stevens's people wouldn't let us or it was too expensive or something. We re recorded. I still. I still prefer that one. Yeah. Difficult, difficult decision. Anyway, that's Rick Ridiculous. Right. Five facts. Right. One is totally made up. All right, Just do three. Three, okay. Right. Oh, let's see. What shall I do? Then there are more moves carefully planned. There are more moves possible in a game of chess. And there are particles in the universe. You can't get any colder than liquid nitrogen. I think it's minus 273. Because you can't. It's impossible to get colder than that. The honey badger has got skin so loose that if you grabbed it by the neck, it could come away from its skin, turn around and bite you out of its anus. That's ridiculous. Right, Rockbusters, then. Wrapping it up. It needs some work, that game, but I see it's got a lot of my age. Then the first one. £42 for a torch. That's a bit pricey. Go on. That was D. That was daylight. Wait. I thought delight. And I thought. It doesn't work. The door. Delight doesn't work. Second one. Wait, wait, wait, dear. Light. It doesn't work. It's D light. Second one was. No, no, Carl, it doesn't work. Yeah, but if we're going to continue with this feature, you've got to tweak them a bit. Right? People have got it. We've had loads of emails, more than ever. So do you know what I mean? Let them decide. If they don't like it, they won't email in. But they're loving it. They've all come from the same institution. It'll fit some chocolate to your feet. That was a. That was Aerosmith. Aerosmith. You've heard of a blacksmith, but a. Smith is just a workman. It doesn't necessarily. No, no, you can have anything. You'd have a locksmith. A smith doesn't just mean. It does shoes. Right. Do you think Aerocobbler would have worked? Unfortunately, there isn't a band called Aerocobbler. Ready with a winner. Do you think your kid will get that strawberry for me? That's Wilson Pickett. Will, son. Pickett. I'll give you that. I have to say that I don't know if these guys have won in the past, but they were the first people to email in. I mean, normally I just give it to anyone, but these guys, literally. You've given the clues, Carl. I'm amazed. Everyone seemed to get Aerosmith. Everyone got D light, everyone got Wilson Pickett. I'm absolutely stunned. I. I just. I. You know, they deserve it. They deserve the junk prizes. Right, so we'll give it to Jonathan and Louise, who, as I say, may have won in the past, but as I say, they were very, very quick. You've got to be there if you want to win. And they're from Wrexham. Brilliant. So good luck to them. So that's they enjoy Jerry's yoga diet. Back next week, then. See you later. See ya. Cheers. Cheers.",
