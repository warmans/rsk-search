I think they're funny. I think they're straight down the line with a little bit of tongue in cheek. Ah, brilliant. See him on Jules Holland. I didn't totally know. Brilliant. Were they good? Absolutely jumped. Oh. I mean, Jules didn't know what to do. Was he playing some boogie woogie? They wouldn't let him play boogie woogie over the song. That's what I mean. That's why he stayed back. But I can't imagine it was very good. He shook that. I'm surprised you say they were. I thought. I. I thought. Hold on. This is missing something. Yeah, this. This is missing someone from Squeeze vamping over them. They did. They did well without him. Extraordinary. Yeah. Well, here we are, then. We're back. XFM 104.9. Car had to leave early last week, but you can just stay to the end this week, mate. Or. Yeah, yeah. You don't need another holiday. Oh. Oh, he started already. Steve's made you look like a bit of a twat already and it's only five past one. But the only reason you don't go on holiday is because you have to spend money. Oh, and he's come straight back. I can't come back to that. It's just dynamite. It's just absolute. That was. That was the last holiday Steve had. He sort of found a third world country so he could live like a king for a week. It was Cuba, wasn't it? Going to Cuba. Amazing. You can. We can almost rule the place. If it weren't for Castro, I'd have been in charge kind of cash. I was flashing around. They'd do anything for a dollar over there. It's extraordinary. Literally. I mean, it's amazing. Yeah. Oh, definitely. And I went to Kenya before that. So he thought the prostitute said, no, you were great. Yeah, well, it was $2. I mean, I'm not made of money. You have a good holiday, Carl? Yeah, it was all right. It's all right. Went down to Cornwall now. You're going to the most people down there, Steve. Well, don't look at me. I'm not from Cornwall. Well, you're from that sort of area. Well, not really, but genetically means. Right. Well, you must have slotted right in. Why are they weird? What do they look like? They're still sort of odd people. A lot of old people, but not just old, sort of messed up old. What do you mean, messed up old? You can't just say that. There was a woman with a funny neck. Okay, in what way was it funny? Why did she have a funny neck? If you were writing an essay, you wouldn't say there was this woman with a funny neck. How would you describe it? She sort of had her head, like pointed down all the time. Don't do it. It's his radio. No, but just for you. I didn't like that. Okay, Right. It's so brilliant. I don't know. I was saying to Susan, I'm not. What happened? You know, what do you think? Because Suzanne knows everything. That's the good thing about her being with you. You just ask her what happened to her, and Suzanne goes, carl, I don't know. Yeah, I haven't been here before. Suzanne your girlfriend? Or Mummy, as you call her. Oh, sparks are flying. A little bit of chocolate. Can you just lick a tissue and wipe it off? Oh, she said it might have been like. Because back in the olden days, they carried stuff on. The. The olden days? What do you mean, the olden days? This woman was probably, what, 50? No, she looked about 70. Yeah, but like I do on Cheeky Freak of the Week, right? I always turn it round and we get like something good out. I said. I said to Suzanne, I bet she finds a lot of money. Yeah. Always staring at the ground. Yeah. So maybe she just had new shoes and she was admiring them. Yeah. Do you think of that before you point the finger and judge? Or our necklace was too heavy. Exactly. So you're back refreshed. So what have we got for this week? Have we? Sort of. Because we didn't meet last night, which we usually meet. I called you and said it'd be good if we could. You know, I wasn't getting back into London. Well, I was up for it. I was up for it past seven, but. Yeah, yeah, but we all need to be there. It's not just me and you being there. Yeah. So. Yeah, no, you're right. I mean, you're absolutely right that I wasn't there yet because I wasn't willing to just be governed by your particular schedule. You want to jet back in from another of your holidays. It wasn't 8 o'clock. Wasn't a holiday, though. What do you mean it wasn't a holiday? What was it? Well, it was a treat, wasn't it, for me mum and dad? So it wasn't a holiday. So you didn't enjoy the five Days off, You'd rather have been here moaning eight hours a day, seven hours a day. You see, we said last week that you're always whinging. Here you are whinging now and you're. Saying it's not even holiday. You're saying it's not even a holiday. What was it then? Would like a nurse who took sick children to Florida. Would they say, I'm on a great holiday. Sorry. What particular ailment did your parents have for the week that they had to. Carl Pilkington, MD. Yeah. What are you talking about? Well, all right, it was holiday. Well, then, good. Now, some honesty, though, some truth. So you came in, you came back from your holiday, you wanted to start back to work straight away, Steve couldn't be bothered to meet. Is that what you're saying? That's what I'm saying. So we've got nothing prepared for this. Well, you can rely on Rockbusters. Right, that's cool. We've got nothing. Monkey News. Even though you're away, you were still. Working, still doing stuff. Did you go to the monkey sanctuary? I'll tell you about that. Tell us about it. Do you want Smashing Pumpkin? Smashing Pumpkins and then Cherub Rock. Yeah. Smashing Pumpkins. Cherub Rock. That, of course, Rick, is available on their Greatest Hits. Brilliant. If you want. I mean, that's how I rock. So. I know, I know they. I'm very much the shape of a cherub as well. Indeed, indeed. Naked with a. And a rosy big arse. And a trumpet. Yeah. Do they have trumpets? I don't know. I've just an email here. Monkey news. Yeah, From a listener. Monkey spotted holidaying in Cornwall. A chimp was spotted holidaying in Cornwall last week after befriending a family of three. One onlooker said it was incredible. He dressed and behaved exactly like a human being. He even settled the hotel bill at the end of their stay. The only telltale sign was his lack of table manners and the incoherent babble when he opened his mouth. There we are. So. Well, we did that. Carl, that's the listeners. Carl, that's Joanne. Amusing, articulate, accurate. She remembered exactly who's there and everything sitting in the bill. It's all there. So, I mean, even though people think that you're slightly simeon, you know, slightly less than human on the evolutionary ladder, they do listen to you. So I don't know who's more stupid in the end, you or the listeners. Well, you may recall, Rick, at the end of last week when Karl had to Shoot off early. We issued a little request, yeah. For listeners just to bombard Carl's email with just pointless emails that really weren't about anything. Just to clog up his email for when he returned. Yeah, Rick, they sent them all to us. Brilliant. I mean, that's the kind of listeners that we've got. We've got reams here on our email of just junk. I mean, it's like a Marx Brothers plot, isn't it? I mean, just listen. I listen to what we say. I got one about a shaved cat. Well, that's not pointless. I'll be reading that later. Yeah, that'll keep me going for a couple of weeks. I'll be reading that later. Did you get to the monkey sanctuary? Because this was the big thing. You were going into Cornwall, you were going to visit the monkey sanctuary. I've never seen someone more excited. You had two days put aside for the monkey sanctuary. How did it go? Monkey World. We were on our way, right. I found like a little. In a little cottage that we had, right? It's like a little. Little folder, you know, with little leaflets in saying if you, you know, if you're into mountains, you want to go here. Yeah. If you're into castles and that little monkey on the leaflet, right. So I thought, I'll be needing that. Took that out, made sure that's safe and that, right? We get in the car, getting ready to go. My dad says, where is it? I'll look on the back. It's in a place called Low or something like that. Right. So we're on our way. Can't believe me. Look, it's gonna be a great day and all that. Yeah. And then start looking at the leaflet, right, and noticed didn't have any chimps there. Yeah. It's not. It's not Monkey World. It wasn't a monkey world. Well, how. What was it called, then? Something like Monkey Town. Yeah, it would just. It had like woolly monkeys in it. That's. That's what? That's what? Woolly monkeys. What are woolly monkeys? Those things. Johnny Vegas off the advert. They're dumped now since ITV Digital went under. So they just put them in a cage. I don't understand. They're like. They're sort of like little fluffy little baboon type things. Willy monkeys. I mean, not. It's not your chimp. It is not. It's not your classic chimpanzee. So did the car screech to a hole? It was like. Yeah, it was like the Mission in Armageddon as you said. Abort. We're on the way back. So how far have you got before you bothered to read the leaflet? Probably about five miles away from where we were. So what did you do with yourself? You must have been distraught. They broke down and then they heard banjo music. No, I went to a sort of an amusement place. I'd love to see you in that. What with putting those coins in so it has to roll down and they go flat and then an arm pushes. It was one of them, really. But I spent years on that when I was little. Well, there's a new one. I can't be bothered explaining it. But it's a con. We went to this place, right? My mum and dad have been there before and he said, you'll love it, it's brilliant. It's got like a wall bit in. It, a war bit. Right. Because they know I'm into tanks and stuff, so you'll be loving that. So sorry, I didn't know you're into tanks. No, well, they're all right. He's gone from one of his childhood passions to where they're all right. I know. Yeah, go on. But it was. It was. It was awful. I mean, my mum, dad been there before and he said, no, you'll love it. But it was like a really miserable day. Sure. All the rides and that were broke. Yeah, bro. It just reminds me of Manchester. My dad just ended up. He was more interested. There was a really fat family there. Well, presumably he was breaking into the machines, trying to scoop off the cash. I like the fact that those poor fat family were going, why are those people looking at us? Yeah. Oh, do you want to ride one? No, but we're not. We're not a ride. They were massive. And he's just like, look at that. Look at the state of that whole family. Yeah, Just, you know, fat bloaters. Yeah. No, because fat. There's no. No need for it, is there? And he was really like, oh, God. And then he wanted to follow them into the outer mirrors to see what they'd look like. But my bored, she went off to buy a little Snow White figure. She couldn't believe her look. It was only 2.99. Yeah. She thought it was gonna be really expensive. She bought one of them, so she enjoyed that. And then my dad says, come on, we go in shrubbish this. What? The fat family wouldn't let him play with him. So he just said on the way home, he said, I can safely say that I never want to go There again before I die. So that was that. And then we went home. Why would he ever give you that information? In case it was like a secret birthday present. Oh, God, what if they get me a trip to here? Or if he's in a coma and you go, I'll tell you what I'll tell you. Bring him out of it. That fat couple. Yeah, yeah. By his bedside. But Suzanne said she now realize why I am the way I am after spending like a week with them. Well, they told. They told her that they dropped you on your head as a kid or. No, just. Just like, you know, the way they act and that. Right. Yeah. Then they were saying things like, Suzanne, so why is the moon out at night in the sun? Oh, God, yeah. Oh, God, there's three of them. Suzanne, can you tie my shoelaces again? It was the bit when my dad said, don't waste money on a coffin for him, just put him in a bin bag. Your father said that about him? Oh, that's a great idea. I'm glad you mentioned that, because that is great. That gives me an idea. Saves a bit of money. My dog. Coldplay. God put a smile upon your face on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant. Carl Pilkington. Reading the paper yesterday, they were talking about the fact that Blair has been. I think he's been in Greece discussing EU matters and they used the old Trojan horse analogy to say, you know, here's a particular policy and it seems like they're trying to sneak in, sneak in some kind of dubious idea. Something else. Exactly. And it's always struck me, ever since I was first introduced to the Trojan horse theory, I never understood how it come about. Do you know what I mean? So Carl has got a frown on him. Like a thing I haven't seen. Yeah. Tony Blair is the Prime Minister. You know, the Trojan horse was gone. Have you come across it before? Wasn't Ascot or anything? Go on. Well, the Trojan horse, what happened was it's. It's a famous kind of Greek story about the fact that the Greeks, in olden times. Olden times specifically. Yeah. The Greeks laid siege to Troy for six years. Basically, things are going out of hand. I think the Trojans had done something with Helen and someone else was annoyed. Anyway, it all got very complicated. It got out of hand. And the Helen, remember the mashed up face? Because I used to use it to launch ships. Anyway, the Greeks laid siege to Troy for six years, right. And they weren't getting anywhere. They were outside the gates they were saying, let us in. They weren't. They were. So all the did was they all disappear. They all wanted to get in and kill everyone. Yeah. That's why they wouldn't be letting in. But they couldn't get inside the city walls. So what they did was they left as a gift for the Trojans. They left an enormous wooden horse, okay, as a gift. And then they all buggered off, like. 40 foot high, 50 foot long. I mean a big, you know, big. Wooden horse, an arc. And the Trojans wheeled it into the city, said, oh, that's nice, thought, what a lovely gift. And lo and behold, he was hiding inside. But an entire Greek army they let out, killed everyone in their sleep. Yeah. All right. And that's where the famous idea of a Trojan horses come from. You know, sneaking something in disguise as something else. All right. Okay. So if you ever. Yeah. He doesn't really understand, does he? No, but to be honest, nor do I. Well, this is the problem I've always had with this because I don't understand who comes up with the idea. I mean, I can't think that was the best idea. Well, no, no, there must be other ways. If they come up with that, how long did it take them to. When they said one before, I said, oh, can I have a word? I've got an idea. Yeah. Build a big horse, right? Hide inside it and then, then, ah, I know what you're thinking. They won't let us in. Even in the horse. Yeah. Leave it as a gift. Brilliant. Right. Who are you? That's the best idea. Are you the guy that came up with, why don't we get a giant bra and twing everyone over the wall? Let's get, let's get a hundred foot ruler and you know, like at school we used to like flick the teacher's ass with like. Right. I could flick you over one at a time, right? On this giant ruler. Your idea, it's on the table. Yeah. We've got a couple of suggestions on the way. What about a million elastic bands tied together? Yeah. And you all hold it down and then I just let you go, right? And you all ping over and then you kill him in this. You're the best tactician we've got, are you? What? The other thing is, right, these people open the, for some reason. Open the door. Well, I don't understand. Firstly, there's suddenly the army that's legitimate for six years has disappeared in their place, an enormous gift of a giant wooden horse. Oh, they probably don't want to Kill us now. But what they've done is they've built. Us a great gift. Presumably there is a giant kind of card or something. You know, something for you. You know, sorry about the Lane siege and everything. Forgive you. It's an enormous gift, is an enormous Trojan horse. We know it's what you've always wanted. We're not inside it. Why don't they write that? That's suspicious. But it's. Anyway, but in terms of it as. An idea initially, I mean, we're gonna give him a gift. Well, what should we do? We could bake an enormous quiche. Be inside that. We could have an enormous soap on a rope. It's the fact that it's an enormous horse. Enormous wooden horse. As a gift. Anyway. I don't know if this was a popular gift at the time, but it's also the stupidity of the Trojans saying, brilliant. I've always wanted the enormous wooden horse. Well, what we gonna do with it? Anyway, let's go to sleep. Let's worry about it tomorrow. Yeah, but it's this idea of going. Someone going, is this definitely the best idea? And they go, yeah. And they look to the carpenter. Yeah. And he goes, well, it's gonna take a while. Yeah, we've gotta get work. Well, you haven't put a door in. How are we gonna get out? Doesn't look like a horse. It is. It's the worst horse I've ever seen. It looks like a cow. Wow. Yeah. The ad is where we hide. There's a horse. It's got no tail. Yeah. About. That's the rope that you climb up. But I don't know if it's one of those things where again, because we kind of learn these things at school, that somewhere along the line the truth of it has disappeared. And, well, I imagine it lost a bit in translation. Yeah. Because in eohippus in Greek means giant tank. Right. So that actually I was a Sherman. Yeah. And it burst through and it shot them all. Yeah. But of course, down the years they've tried. Look at Carl's face. Look at Carl's face. If everyone on webcam. Carl, just keep that face and look up to the camera. Right, Just. Right, get a look at that. Now play a record. Carl. Educating Carl. We should bring that back. We should bring that back. Yeah. What do you want to learn about next week? We've told you about the Trojan horse. Know anything about any freaks? Placebo. This Picture on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Right, so you've been educated there, haven't you? The Trojan horse. And that's of course where the phrase be where Greeks bearing gifts comes from. Silence again. Yeah, go on, what's that again? Beware Greeks bearing gifts. Right, what do you think that means? I don't know. I mean, what is that? Is that used worldwide or what, will he say that in Greece as well? Or imagine Christmas Day is rubbish? No, it doesn't actually mean beware of Greeks wearing gifts. It's more to do with like, maybe it's too good to be true or, you know, it's the opposite. To don't look gift horse in the mouth. Well, for probably where it came from as well. Justin from Southend Email. And he just said for the Trojans not to have spotted that it was a trick. They must have been the biggest bunch of moronic. Mmm, yeah. Ever to have walked the earth. Does Carl have any Trojan in him by any chance? Cheeky, innit, eh? What? Nevermind. I think that properly proves it. I thought another one I like as well. I was saying, you may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. I've never heard. I don't think I've heard that. I have heard, but I don't think I've ever used it in common parlance. Well, it's like if you're gonna do something, you know as well, go the whole hog depending on the. The outcome. Because it's based on reality. That's why I like it. Because obviously the poor people used to poach and if they were caught stealing, you know, a sheep or anything, they would be hung. So if you're gonna get caught, don't steal a lamb, you know, at least feed your family for a few weeks. Right, sure. Kill a sheep. Yeah, yeah. Actually hung a sheep. Your dad would be in trouble. Daniel Wales, stealing stuff from that. Oh, in that phone box. Well, he has a couple of sayings. Right, yeah. I've never asked him what they mean. Why would you? Suzanne? One is don't try and teach your granny to suck eggs. Yeah. What does that mean? That means is patronizing to. To. Of course, of course. I know that you're talking to someone who knows more about this subject than. You, but how did that happen then? How did that saying come about? Well, it's not. It's. It's a totally made up thing. It's like your granny sucks eggs and she. Because she's. She's older than you and it's probably a lost art or something. All right. And the other one sucks eggs. Sucks eggs. Sorry, I thought you said something else. Don't nudge your granny when she's shaving. What? Sorry? Don't nudge your granny while she's shaving. Don't nudge. Sorry. Don't judge your granny when she's having a shave. Well, what is that in context? Because I can't work out what the analogy is there. Because that might just be you. When you were little, you used to run up to your granny while she was shaving or. Summer, why is your granny shaving? Well, then what. What context is that? Said and tell me the last time your dad ever said that and I'll try and work out what it means. Can't remember. I can't. I don't know if these are specific to your granny. I was gonna say. Were you nudging your granny? She was going, yeah, lost, Carl. She was shaving off her moustache or. Giving herself a Brazilian. That's grotesque. Sucking egg. Sucking egg. Sucking eggs. Oh, God, that's made it worse. Carl's granny sucking eggs whilst that's. That is Brazilian. We've no idea. I don't know what that means. Don't nudge your granny while she's shaving. What? Parmesan. I don't know. Maybe someone knows. You might be right. Maybe. Well, email in. Tell us anyway. Rockbusters. Carl, should we get the ball rolling? Let me just find the. The gifts here, the little treats. We've got the album from the Coral. You know what I think about that? We've got Inside Feeder. Well, it's just a novelty record, isn't it? Yeah. We've got on DVD more great comedy moments, favorite clips from the best of contemporary BBC comedy. We got Partridge on the front there. We've got one of the guys from Red Dwarf and stuff on there. Smash Hits, the reunion. More great 80s tunes. Catch a Google's on there. Plus some stuff. Too Shy. It is too shy. Yeah. Actually, let me see if you can guess which one's Tiffany. Oh, yeah, I know it. The only one, I think. Yeah, I think we. Yeah. Melon Kim. Respectable Human League, that be. Oh, wow. What would. Would they have got? Don't you want me? Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Huh. Last take on Me. Yep. Well done. Madness. Baggy Trousers. Of course. Kim Wilde, Kids in America. Yeah. So there's just all those treats. If you. If you like a song from an 80s band. It's probably on there. Yeah. Okay. Plus we've also got on vhs, Graham Norton, some kind of Best of compilation from his TV show. So there are the. Hold on. Is it. Is it the one where he talks to sort of female gay icons and look to the Internet? Because that's my favorite one. Right, there you go. Let's do Rockbusters. Email only, of course. Yeah, email in. Ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk. if you know the answer. Right, first one, A bit of a cryptic clue if you haven't heard it before. Well, not cryptic. We're gone. What is Carl thinking? If you go into France by boat, I'd get your fags on there because it's a lot cheaper. Imagine Bob Holness. Sorry, we're out of time. Sorry, your minute's up. You've won nothing. I was reading that question out. Let's do it again. And I want it to be exactly the same word. Perfect. I bet you it will change all over the place. He's lost it. Okay, okay, fingers on the buzzers. You've only got 10 seconds to win the. The gold run. Okay, first up here. I'll tell you what. No, seriously, if you're thinking of going to France, well, don't, you know, because go on the ferry, get the fags there because it's cheaper. Go on. Alright, so that one again. If you want to buy some fags, you're going over to France on a boat, get them on there because you'll save a few quid. Bf. Bf. Bf. Okay. Alright, the second one. This little foreign cafe is growing its own steak. This little foreign cafe is growing its own steak. This little foreign cafe's growing its own steak. Go on. D. All right. Right. Okay. And the last one. Is that part of it? Hang on. He's the best. He's the best. The Jamaican fella might have screamed this on the. On the Titanic. Well, the Jamaican fella might have. Might have screamed this on the Titanic. Yeah. What's it start with? It's C. D. That one Jamaican phone. Might have screamed this on the Titanic. Ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk, please don't phone in if you can get those. We just don't want to talk to you. Is that an Nelly? Yeah, it's a summer favorite. Nelly Ride With Me. That's featuring City Spud. I don't know if you're aware of that, but there we are. Good. Nice summer tune. Carl, tell Steve what you just told me. When Steve was in the toilet then. Right. You know, I've just been away with my mum and dad and that and one of the Things I always like doing is having a good chat with me dad about stuff he got up to when he was a kid and that. Yeah, right. Because he got up to loads of stuff. And every time I see him, he tells me something. It's like, why are you just telling me that now? He's brilliant. Yeah. So I. I mean, to me, he's kind of like Ronnie Biggs or someone. He's just the most extraordinary kind of. Well, this happened. I can't remember. There was a delay yesterday. There was problems on the Paddington Line. And he was saying, our trains aren't what they used to be. Sure. He said, you know, they used to. Be horses, didn't they? Well, he was like. He was looking in the booklet and it was saying how you can have your bags collected if you want, but it costs you a fiver. Yeah. So that's outrageous. Sure, course. Right. So he said, that's the problem with this country. We've got good with computers and that, but when it comes to, like, getting service, it's gone out the window. Yeah, right. So he said, when I worked on the trains, you know, and he was going on like this, that and the other. So I said, oh, I didn't know you worked on the trains. He said, yeah, yeah, when I was 18. Right. It was his job to get the coal, right. And chuck it in the engine. Right. And one day he's in. He's in Grand Central Station in Manchester, which is now the Gmech Center. Right. And that was like the main station. And he was in there, the fellow who should have been sort of driving the train, he said, I'm just nipping to the pub. Sure. So you just stay here, keep the engine topped up and stuff. Yeah. So he's like, for a quick getaway. So the fellow goes in the pub and my dad's in there, you know, putting the coal on. He did his bacon and eggs on a little. A little shovel. Yep, yep. And anyway, fella comes up, he says, right, can you move the train forward now? Oh, blimey. So he was like, oh. So he didn't want to say, oh, the fellas in the pub. Because he know, he'd say, what's he doing? The pub? You should be working. Right. So he said, yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem. I'll sort it out. All right. So he puts it. Puts it into gear or whatever you do on. On them trains. Sure. Puts it in first. Yeah. Starts going forward. Now, people who don't know about trains. Something that I learned is if you're carrying A load of coal or whatever on the back of it. They don't have brakes on each carriage. Right. It's only the engine that has brakes on it. So when you pull the brakes on the. On the engine, the whole weight of what it's pulling is pushing you forward. Sure. Right. Yeah. So he doesn't realize this, though, because he's just used to cooking bacon and eggs and chucking coal. Of course. Yeah. So you've got to slam the brakes on sooner than you would normally do. Well, you have to anticipate it, I suppose. Yeah. Yeah. But he didn't know that. So he's pulling in this thing. You're right. I'll put the brakes on now. Yeah. Puts the brakes on. The train just keeps going. He's going. Oh, God, it's not stopping. Sure. It plows right through the signal box. Right. Pulling the signals on the water. Yeah. Loads of. Loads of damage done, apparently. If it was today's money. Yeah, it'd be about three to four million pounds worth of damage. It shut the station off for four weeks. But he didn't lose his job. The fella had lost his job, the one who was in the. In the pub. Yeah. He said. The funny thing was, he said, like, £4 million worth of damage. He did his ankle, his wrist in. He had three weeks off sick and got paid. I love your family. It's extraordinary, the Pilkinson gene. I'd like to see a documentary following you and your family. You'd have to get the family involved. Nah, that's the sort of stuff my dad goes on about. They'd never put it on. Sally. Out of time on XFM 104.9. We ought to give those Rockbusters clues again. Yeah, go on. We've had very few contributions so far. I think you've really started. This might be it. I've told you, you're on thin ice. If this. If this goes wrong, if it's rubbish and if everyone doesn't get them all, that's the end of Rockbusters. Right, well, the first one again, right? Yeah. If you go out of France, right, by boat, you might as well get your fags whilst you're on that, because you'll save a few quid. Different every time. Bf. BF is the initials of the artist that that little cryptic clue makes up the second one. Little foreign coffee growing its own steak. Right, That's D. Little foreign coffee, it's growing its own steak. D and the last one, if there was a Jamaican fella on the Titanic, when it went down, it'd probably scream this C D. Right, so email in ricky.gervasexfm.co.uk yeah, they're not flooding in, but. Yeah, well, I'll see how we do. Carl, have we still got monkey news? We've got monkey news coming up now. You must be disappointed because you didn't make it to the monkey sanctuary, but you still managed to scrape together monkey news on your holiday. That's found some of that. We've got. How do you get so many breaks and holidays? Because you went. You went away with Suzanne's parents. You just been away with your parents. That's a couple of weeks, 10 days. So that's probably about three weeks in all. You had that. You went to Manchester. You were. You had that day off because your trousers were wet. I mean, and you've, you know, I mean, I suppose because you've only got one job and, you know, I've got a lot more. This is just one of my jobs. But I mean, don't you ever count your blessings? Go, God. Thank God. I just. I can have time off. I don't work too hard, you know, I'm not stressed too much. It's just all to do with. When you do work, do a lot. So I've. I get a lot done. Yeah. What do you mean? I'm always doing stuff. I mean, even though when I was in Cornwall, right, I'm sat there on the grass. Oh, I'd love to just sit on the grass. I know, yeah. Well, you know, me dad and Susanna playing crib. Right. I'd sort of fallen out with him. Susanna playing in the 1940s. Yeah. Why did you fallen out? Because with crib. Have you ever played crib? Yeah. Right. You've got to be pretty good at maths. Sure. You've got to make your cards add up to 15. And I'm just gonna. I was just gonna Correct. John, you've got to be good at maths. Yeah. What, what, algebra? Quantum physics. What? No, just. Just adding. Adding up to 15. Brilliant. I mean, you almost do it on your fingers. You could in Cornwall. Yeah. But my dad's really good at maths and like he said, how many have you got? And he always counts, isn't. It's like 15, 2, 15 4, 15, 6, 3, 3 for your. @ once and all that. Do you know what I mean? He adds it up really well for his knob, right. So I was like, right, hang on a minute. And he goes, no, what do you mean, hang on? I know. What have you got. Ah, forget it. I said this isn't. This isn't fun. If you're gonna start getting all arty with me. Sure, I love it. But he's only. I'm sure he's. I don't know him, but I'm sure he's just winding you up it. His victory is you going, ah, forget it. I'm not playing well anyway, right. So it doesn't matter. I think I'll go off and do some prep. Right. Do some research for Saturday. Found one of Suzanne's magazines. Right. Flicking through because there's always interesting stuff in there. There was something about, about Swingers, right. I was like, what's all that about? Yeah. And it had an interview with some people talking about, you know, how the sleep about a bit. Yeah. And I thought if my wife looked like that, I probably would because there was a few pictures of them and they were all pretty ugly. Yes. I thought, right. So I took that in, soaked that up, thought, there you go. Carried on reading. There was a bit in there about our women still have crushes, right? Yes. And the woman was going on about her, how she's 38, right. But she still fancies Chris Martin from Coldplay. And, you know, even though it'll never happen, she's still got that little bit in her head that thinks one day she'll leave Gwyneth. Right. And end up with, with. With her. Right, Right. Anyway, so I'm flicking. I'm thinking this is a bit boring, but I'm flicking through it all and. Is this a Rockbusters clue? No, no, I read further on, read further on. Right. And she said, you know, I like to go out with me mates and we come up with lists in pubs of people who like, oh, you know, they'd be nice to go out with. She also came up with a list of unlikely lost objects. I think she called them. Yeah. Guess who was in that list. Ricky Gervais. Think again. Carl Pilkington. Right, next one. Johnny Vegas said, lanky co writer. Rubbish. Lanky co writer. What do you mean, lanky co writer? Well, do I need to say anymore? Hang on, wait a minute. Let's not talk about. I don't know why you're laughing at my expense. I'm an unlikely lust object. Yeah, but you. Yeah. What was it called? The list? The. The unlikely lost object. Yes. You were in there. Who else was? Well, you weren't in there. Richard Madeley. Fine. Yeah. It's a good looking guy. Alistair Campbell. Brilliant. Another handsome dude. What you talking about? How can you. How you. What, you think I'm ashamed or embarrassed about that? I'm proud of it. What magazine was it? I need to buy a couple of things. You need to get a T shirt, mate. Yeah. And did she leave her number? Yeah. What. What magazine was it? Just. I'm just out of interest. I think it's called Red. Yeah, sure. But now you've dissed those people that have put themselves in their swingers because you've said they're ugly. So now we know what magazine it is. People look at that. People look at that poor woman and they're gonna know. You think she's a hog. No, but I. I think they. Even though. Was there a picture of the woman who drawn up the list of unlikely lust objects? What would she like? I wouldn't waste my time. Thanks, mate. I know you're on my side. Oh, God, The Thrills on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant, Object of unlikely lust object. Steve Merchant. I'd like to have that now prefixing my name everywhere I'm written about. I know, yeah. Did he make the freak list? Which is a different magazine, isn't it? And I'm joking, of course. Carl Pilkington, a man of sort of quiet, quiet dignity. And. And in a way, he's got his own sort of inner beauty, hasn't he, Carl? Not really. Do you think? Well, I'll tell you why I don't think it is because the woman that wrote the piece saying that I was an unlikely lust object has just emailed in. And, Carl, you've offended her quite considerably. What did he say? I wouldn't waste my time is what you said. She's repeated that I wouldn't waste my time. The flaming cheek. Although it's a horrible picture, I am, of course, in real life, a vision of loveliness. I'm not 30, I'm 25. I don't think Stephen's that unlikely lust object. A sense of humor is important and he's welcome to my phone number if he wants it. That sense of humor is important. That's a down swinger. Stop it. Don't have a go at the woman. I'm messing about. She knows I'm messing about. Well, how are you messing about? I've told you this, though. I've told you that. Anyone could be listening, haven't I? I've told you that before. Things you say. And. And you. But we encourage him. We say, what does he look like? We. But it's Meant to be rhetorical. That was a joke. That was Steve joke. What does it look like? I. E. Him joking like, oh, I'll call her up because I'm on a list. And then you have to say that. I mean, that's what I mean. Chances are if, you know, if she likes Stephen, she hasn't seen him. She listens to the radio, so the likelihood is that, you know, she was listening to this show. Yeah. So think, will I drop the thing I was going to do about Lisa Riley? Well, she's not listening. Some people deserve it. She's still at lunch. What, from Tuesday? There's an all you can eat place. Going out of business. Oh, bloody hell, she's back. You killed me. I got a bambino. Please leave now. Please leave. So, no, but she knows was only messing this. Yeah, everyone knows you're only missing. We're all only messing. I hope we don't offend anyone of, you know, any kind out there. We're only joking, aren't we, Carl? Say something nice about her. What can you remember of the picture that you could. That you could say was good? Maybe she was wearing some nice things, to be honest. I'll have another look. And have a look. I think she had a nice shirt on the floor. Forthcoming single from British Sea Power, that's called Carry On. I love it. It's great. It's fantastic. On XFM 104.9. What do you make, Carl, of these people? I was reading the paper today. They've been queuing up for 12 hours last night for the new Harry Potter book. Oh, God. God, it really annoys me. Everything. Oh, God. God, it really annoys me. But who has to? I mean, I know it's just a kind of willful sort of stubbornness. I see adults, yeah. Reading it, you know. Well, I was up in Hampstead last night and there's a Waterstones branch of that and there were a couple of people outside, queuing, waiting for it to open. What they look like? Well, they're like the ones that come out of a forbidden planet on a Thursday. There was one guy. I mean, I don't mean to disrespect him, but he was a big bloater. Shorts wearing shorts. I don't want to see his big fleshy legs. He looked like John L Coleman. If I'm not there's anyone with John O'Coleman. They always seem to have knapsacks for some reason. Well, they got old. They got old papers in there. Exactly. Nine years supply four of them. There was a Couple of women, a couple of guys all look basically the same, they're interchangeable. And they were there for a moment. I am the fat bloater with fleshy legs. I recognize your description. I like to read these books whilst listening to XFM of a Saturday. And I watching them from where I was and I. And they were, must have been there for about an hour and a half. They're obviously strangers. They'd all their common interest was Harry Potter. They were reading, they were sort of chatting to each other for about an hour and a half. So as I'm leaving I wander past them an hour and a half in to them having met each other. The conversation is all I heard was well of course, apparently she cried when she finished the last one. And I thought they got. They've not moved on. The conversation had not moved on. Now they might have been talking about Dawn French, you know, chocolate orange by then. Yeah, I know she cried when she finished the last one once. Yeah, but I got no time for him pop into walrus now. Yeah, I'll tell you what, you're gonna get home at half one and start reading it. Exactly. Brilliant. So you can put it on the Internet. Oh God, your opinions. Oh, it annoys me. It is extraordinary. The whole kind of, the whole kind of Harry Potter phenomenon has passed me by. I know, I know people. Good luck to her, you know. But you meet adults who are. You say, what are you doing? I'm just rereading Harry Potter. What, you couldn't follow it the first time? Yeah, I mean, I mean it's not her fault, you know, she made £300 million by writing a few books for her kids. Well done. But I'm sure, I mean I'm not sure they're very good but I'm, I haven't read them. I'm sure they're not. But no, I don't know. No, no, no, I'm joking. Book about a little wizard with glasses and make millions. So easy. If you think it's so easy, you do it. You, you like him because you look a bit like him. Well, you know, I wonder if he's on a. That wish list that, that woman who emailed in. Why was she making a list of unlikely. Can we leave this now? No, but I mean what was it? What was context was it. It was like here's my top 10 weird looking fellas that I do. What was it? What was the. What was she was talking about? What, what was she'd started talking about? What body wax and went and by the Way while I'm here is 10 blokes that I would if I had to and they're a bit weird. You'll be surprised. What was the context? Forgot. He's going to say anything now. He's scared to say anything. Oh, bless him. I just was looking at a picture because I was attracted to it because she was good looking and that didn't. Read on. All right, well done. Let's got you out of that little mess. Harry Potter. Yeah. You can't be honest with it. Have you read them? No, because the first time it came out I was a bit confused, wasn't I? Because I thought it was. Of course you were, yeah. This is a. What? It's a book. No, I got confused with the little. The little rabbit. I thought it was her, didn't I? You talked about it. Beatrix Potter. Yeah, I got mixed up with that. So I sort of missed out on the first one. Anyway, you were just running around confused. Sort of too late to get into it, I think. Yeah, it's too late now. Yeah, it's impossible. Same with Shakespeare. If you weren't around, you know, the day. The day you wrote the first ones. There's no point in going back. But it's all the fuss that she's getting as well, like. Well, I think it's because she's a British industry now, isn't she? I mean, it must have made, what, billions? Well, it's the perfect success story. She writes a story for her children and it becomes a worldwide phenomenon. You know, it's not cynical, it's just. It's just a great. Didn't your dad ever pop anything down in writing? I'll tell you what, my mum wanted to do it. Yeah. There's been loads of things, little inventions she's come up with and that. Which has been too busy doing other stuff. But she used to come up with stories for me as a kid that I'm sure if they came out, they'd be a success. Yeah, go on. Do you remember any of them? It was one about a little red car. I can't remember how that ended, but the one that was really good was about a kid who gets a dog. Right. But it's quite an old dog. This is gonna be an episode of the Walt one. Go on, go on. And he's playing with the dog and that. But it starts getting a bit old, about 15 or whatever. Yeah. And he goes, oh, it's rubbish, this dog. I would love that book for kids. I would love that. Tommy went, oh, Mummy, my Dad's. Kill it then. Kill it then. Shall I? Yeah, just throw it in the lake. I'll get you another one. Do you want a Nintendo? Yeah. Kick the rabbit to death then or no food for you. Brilliant. Come on, jump. Van Halen on XFM 104.9. Right, come on. And Carl, we've got a lot to fit in now. We've insulted a lot of people. Only about 25 minutes to go. We've got Monkey news, we've got Rockbusters and we got a cheeky figure of the week this week. Could crumb it in. See how we do. We wanna do we want to hear the end of Carl's story? Yeah. Little Timmy and his is 15 year old dog, Lucky. Got a bit bored with it, right? So he said, oh mum, you know this dog's rubbish and that. I'm sick of it. Yeah. So she goes, I'll be. When your mum was telling you this story, I don't know, about four, okay. It wasn't last week on holiday, so. So she goes, oh, all right then we'll get you another one. Yeah. She goes, brilliant. What'd you do with the old one? Just kept it but didn't sort of play with it. Just ostracized it. Free will or curl up and die. Yeah, go on. Yeah. So what'd you get him? What sort of dog? I think it was a little, little baby, like Labrador. Puppy. Not puppy. Yeah, yeah, good one, Good choice. Good choice for a second dog. So, yeah, I'm loving this story. I am actually loving the story. So where does he live? I don't know. It didn't matter. Didn't matter. It was near, near a lake. Getting rid of all the. Yeah, sure, yeah, we're getting. That will make sense in a minute. Right, so. So he's got a little dog, he's playing around with it. He's playing with its belly and stuff. He's thinking, this is brilliant. Best dog I've ever had. Right? And the other dog sat in the corner looking all fed up. Yeah. So I like this story. So he says, he says to his mom, right, I'm taking little puppy down the park, yeah. And she goes, well take the old one with you. And he goes, oh, do we have to? It's the more I bet the old one saves him. So. So he goes, oh, do I have to? She goes, yeah, it still needs a walk and that, scrapping all over the house. So takes it down the park, right? And he's playing around and he's playing there that near the lake. Is the puppy near the lake, Carl? Because this is what's worrying me. Yeah. Pop is near the lake, right? That jumps in. The kid goes, oh, God. He jumps in, remembers he can't swim. Yeah. This kid is based on you in it. Almost certainly flapping about. Water's going everywhere. He's gonna come. Oh, God. He wants a puppy to help him, but the puppy's just, like, drowning as well. Yeah. The old dog comes up, drags them both out. He goes, I can't believe it. You know, I said I was fed up with you. Yeah. You saved me life. Yeah. He gets home and he says to his mom, kill the little one. Kill the puppy. Yeah. So it's good. Little. What does he say when he gets home? He said, I don't need the puppy now. Brilliant. Brilliant. Genius. Good. Yeah. So the moral of that story is all your whims. Yeah. If you get bored, get bored and get another puppy. If you get bored with the old one again, just do it again. I mean, just eventually. Eventually, you know, get something. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's brilliant. That is a brilliant story, though. Right, so that's that. Rock Busters. Yes. I don't want you to have monkey news right now because I've just had a little story there. Sure. Yeah. Don't go too far. Yeah, go on. So we'll get Rockbusters out the way if we've got a winner. Yeah, come on in. See, it worries me that we've had a very few entries. I think that even your mental fans aren't getting these, which is really worrying. They must be terrible clues this week. All right, well, has anyone gotten right, Steve? I think there's just one guy. Yeah. Who I suspect has won in the past. Well, so what? Right. The first one. If you go out of France by boat, you might as well buy your fags when you're on that because you'll get them a lot cheaper. Brilliant. Right? Yeah. Bf. Yeah. Buy it Fairy. Right. That's like, what? Buy on ferry. What? Biome Ferry. Who's. What's that? Is that a band? What? What is it? I don't know what it is. Brian Ferry. Brian Ferry. What's that got to do with buying on a ferry, though? Because he's quite close to it. What? Bion Ferry. Sorry, what's your first language? The second one. That's rubbish. That doesn't count. Brian Bayern. Ferry. Brian Ferry. By on ferry. There's this little foreign coffee. It's growing its own steak. That's Delametri. The third one. What? What. What is that? What is that? Delametri. Deli is a little foreign coffee. Yeah. A meat tree in that. A meat tree. A meat tree. What were the initials for that? Just. Just D for that. Just D for that? Yeah. So not D. A. So you didn't even give him a chance to get the group? They got it. Well, no, no, no, no, they. They didn't. Right. It's the end. They're gone. Right, go on. Deli, meat tree. Deli, meat tree. One word or any letter M's in it. Go on. Okay, so Bayern. Bayern. I love buying ferry music. Oxymusic was brilliant. I love ox. I just point out, Rick, that David Bowie deli meat tree. Yeah. I don't see why necessarily, Aiden, who emailed in, why he doesn't get to win because he emailed in. Dire stakes seems to me just as valid, as far as I can tell. But Deli Metri it is. And the last one, if there was a Jamaican fella on the tire tank. I'm looking forward to this with a. Little bit of fear. Jamaican fella. If he was on the Titanic, he probably would have screamed this. Yeah, that's Christ de burgh. Oh, I don't know what to do. Stunning. So who's the winner? I'm not gonna give it to anyone. I just don't say. What's the Jamaican bit got to do with it? Just a D. Just. Christy Burglary. Say it again. No, I think they've worked it out now. What's good? Do I say again? Christ de burgh. And who's that? What? Who's that? Who's what? Who's Christ de berg Christeberg. Who's the winner, Steve? Do you know what? I'm gonna give it to Abrams because he just. He just treated you with nothing but contempt. Steve Martin emailed in again. He got the first two, and then the last one he just emailed. I neither know nor care about this answer I'm tempted to give him. Do you know what you've done there? Don't you? You've put the nail in the coffin of Rockbusters. I warned you. I warned you for three weeks. And you sort of bucked your ideas up for a little while, but Christ did. Those are the worst you've ever done. The worst. Delimitri. So. And didn't just put D and then Bayern. Bayern, Ferry. So is that it or not? We're doing it. Play a record. Aren't we doing it anymore? You're an idiot. Are we doing it anymore. I'm just gonna keep saying, you're an idiot. Play it a record. You Learned nothing from Dr. Fox. Yeah, yeah. That's not a Sony. Out the window. Aren't we doing it anymore? What? You need to start working on it now. Because they're so good. You need to start working now for next Saturday. Aren't we doing it anymore? Just, I don't know. Flaming Lips Fight Test. So, end of Rockwesters? Probably. I think. Well, a little rest. I didn't. I didn't announce a winner and I would like to give the prize to Mark Blackwell because I think Mark treated the quiz with the kind of contempt it deserves by emailing in the right answers after we'd given them out. And that seems fair enough to me. That's still surprising, right? It's amazing. So well done, Mark. You get those fairly mediocre prizes. Average. I'd love some average, yeah. Monkey news afterwards. Well, maybe. Cardigans. You're the storm on XFM 104.9. Well, nearly the end of the show, but we wouldn't, you know, we wouldn't let them down, would we? You know what it is now, don't ya? Oh, chimpanzee that. Monkey news. Right? Now, whilst I was in Cornwall, I wasn't online, I didn't have the Internet, so it's like, oh, what am I gonna do? And I didn't come back till yesterday. I thought, is there loads going on that I don't know about in the monkey world and stuff? I was hoping to get some from the zoo that I was meant to be going to. Of course that didn't happen. So I said to me, dad, do you know anything about monkeys? Have you got any stories? Brilliant. This is. No, this is what Trevor McDonald does. Turned out quarter 10. He goes on nothing. Dad, anything happened? You got anything politics? Anything politics? Dad, this isn't monkey news. I'm just giving you this free. Yeah, brilliant. Turned out one of his mates used to have a chimp, right? What do you mean one of his mates used to have a chimp? Well, two. Two of his mates. Sorry, yeah, I was thinking it sounds a bit far fetched, living in Manchester, like, but if there was two of. Them, he had a chimp. Had to thump it in the head. We're doing what? Answering back. Oh, God. Tried it on with his wife. Trying it on with his wife. I love it, I love it. It's a proper fist fight in a pub in Manchester. Oh, I'd call him up, but he's one of them who like swears all the time. I mean, it'd be good. It'd be good to get him on. Let's interview him. Can we not interview him? Pre record? We can bleep out the swear and I'd love to hear his story. Yeah, well, it did. Well, we're not scared of work. Aren't you? No. I mean, I'll do it myself if you can't be bothered. Yeah. Well, don't tell us the rest of the story then. Let's let him say no. But there's another one as well. When you say you can get him on, but he swears like. You mean the monkey. I'm assuming he's more coherent than your dad's mate. But he's him. And there's some other fellow he knows who had a funny name. I'll have to find out because you'll love his name. But he was a drag artist. Yeah. And I think he said he went. My dad went round one day, I don't know why. Went around there, knocked on the door. Chimpanzee. Carl, I don't know what you're doing, mate. I don't know where this place. You live next door. There's an horse in the front room. There's chimps running around, mad. Anyway. Chimpanzee. Is that it? Is that the end of the story? There's a chimpanzer in the door and that's the end. You sure it wasn't the drag artist before he'd shave? No, sure it wasn't your grand. Because I like the really airy ones that decide they can be female impersonators. Yeah. Anyway, this is the monkey news, so you got that for free. What's this gonna be like? Well, let's have more jingles. Okay. Oh, chimpanzee that monkey news extra. Okay. Right. Another phrase. We've been talking about phrases today. Yeah, we have. When she's shaving. Yeah. Don't teach your grandma to suck eggs. Yeah. Don't look horse in the mouth. Don't let the chin pass the jaw if you're chucking your cock in. Familiar with the phrase monkey business? No, never heard that one before. Carl, that's brilliant. Right, well, it came about. This has been emailed in. I haven't really had a chance to look at it. So I'm just weighing it up now. Isn'T it, really? I'm ashamed of it. I mean, what was Dr. Fox? Dr. Fox must have been really polite. He must have been thinking. I don't know how to put this. He Must have wanted to scream and go, you shouldn't be in the Radio Authority. My parents listen online. I can't look them in the eye. Right. I think I've weighed it up. Long time ago. Right. Yeah. Olden days. Yeah. In the Amazon jungle. Yeah. Right. Little family of monkeys in there. Right. Having a good life. Right. Didn't have any predators in there. Right. So they were loving it. Yeah. They had a load of food around them. They had loads of banana trees. Yeah, Right. No, I don't think so. No, they do. Sorry. Everything's going great. So they're happy in that. They go to bed. Okay. Wake up in the morning, load of bananas gone. Ooh, hang on. Interesting. Hold on, wait a minute. So either your dad's been around or. This isn't the great Amazon banana robbery, is it? So anyway, turns out it was another load of monkeys from another part of the island. From the rough bit. From the rough bit. From the rough bit. I love it. They went into a middle class area. They're the ones with the earrings and the leather jacket. That is brilliant. Part of the island. So the monkeys thought, well, there's no point getting into a fight with them because they're harder than we are. Yeah, of course. And they carry chains. I love all this confession. They've got flick knives and tattoos. Yeah, go on. So basically they said, let's do some business with the bananas. Let's do some business shopping for them. This is a. This is. What are you talking about? Oh, Christ. Right, calm down. We haven't got much time left. Oh, God. What do you mean? Forget it. No, don't forget it. Carl, do not. Seriously, switch the record off. Switch the record off. Switch the record off. Carl, what are you talking about? What did they do? Oh, let's do business with the bananas. Yeah. So they said, well, rather than them coming, robbing them, we'll. We'll flog them. So that got a stop to it. Then the people, the monkeys came, they didn't have money. They said, give us some monkey, you know, give us some bananas. And it says, so what? They exchanged bananas for bananas for berries and nuts. So that's where the phrase monkey business. No, no business to settle. All right, there we go. That's the end of that as well. So that's the end. That is a shame. That's the end of Rockbusters and Monkey News. Well done. You've done it in one show. Animal Nitrate by Suede. We've got to go. Goodbye. On the. On the day that we saw the end of Rockbusters and monkey News. Next up is Alex Zane. He's got the body of the man with the face of a lady. See you next week, xfm.",
