  "text": "Okay, let's have a great show, everyone. Yeah, good. Good luck. Right, that was Jane's Addiction. Just because on XFM 104.9. Right, everybody up. Let's give them a great show. Yeah. Two hours of, like, fun chat. Let's keep it, you know, let's keep it cutting edge. Let's not be too. I mean, that's what the listeners of XFM would. Oh, no, it isn't, is it? No, because. Hold on one minute. Because we came in yesterday and did this little skit, didn't we, where we bleeped it out, a little sketch. It was quite noisy. Carl called me last night and we're not allowed to play it out. Oh, we've been censored. Yeah. So it's a cutting edge alternative station. Wants to push the boundaries. Wants to be thought of as. Yeah, a bit punk. A bit punk rock. Yeah. Because I. I said something like the Radio Authority. I bleeped it out. What? I called them. Yeah, but couldn't do it. Couldn't do it. Censored. Carl agrees, though. What's your thoughts, Carl? You agree with that? Yeah, I agree, yeah. Why? What's the point? It was funny, wasn't it? And it wasn't offensive. Not really. It's not some of the best stuff that would have ever gone out on this show. But, you know. Right, what are you putting up against exactly? Cheeky freak of the week. Well, that, that springs to mind. Yeah. Busters. But I mean, the thing is, you know, the things that you have put out there, I mean, we better be really careful. He was worried about complaints. I mean, it's not just swearing, is it? It's taste and decency and everything. So we can't. We can't laugh about the disabled anymore in the Cheeky freak of the Week. Can't do stories about elderly relatives with genitals looking like a split tennis ball. Can't tell your bad dad. Putting a child with learning difficulties in a bin. So what, should we just play music? I think that's all it's gonna have to be. Yeah. Play record. Accidents Will Happen by Alvis Costello on XFM 104.9. Carl's a little bit stressed. It's not his fault. It was the boss that overruled him. He came along. What'd he do? He heard you. He heard you listening to it? Yeah. What did he say? He said. I said, it's what Ricky wants to play out tomorrow. Yeah. And he said, well, can't go out like that. Too many. But they all believed we Bleeped the swear words. Yeah, but I didn't want it to go out. I mean, you gotta remember, right. We came. You came in yesterday to have a chat about what we're gonna do. Yeah. One of the topics that I said let's talk about, which I came up with. Yeah. Was let's talk about swearing. Now, you said you never had problem with swearing. That's right. And then we did a thing about. Isn't it funny that you can the heart. You know. You know the thing about you can bleep a swear word by taking out the vowel. So we're going. So it's the valve that's offensive. And we did a little sketch around that and then ended, you know, and he wanted to completely obliterate the word in the end. Didn't want to put the thing in. We said about the Radio Authority, which I don't. I don't think. I think it was valid and wouldn't have got a complaint. Yeah, but at the end of the day, he's the boss and what. What he says goes, doesn't it? Sure. So, yeah, I was just gonna say. But what you got to remember is what he also said is if you want to pay the 70 grand fine, then go ahead and do it. Steve. There wouldn't be a 70 grand fine, though. Well, you don't know what it'd be. But will you pay it? Will you pay for my mortgage? Will you pay for his mortgage? Will you feed his kids? He wouldn't be fired. What do you mean? Well, if I tell you what, if he's not a fine, we'd lose the license. Then we'd all be fired. Right. Does he seriously think you'd lose the license for that sketch? Does he really seriously think it's. It is not the worst thing we've ever put out or done or ever will do. Yeah, but it's the fact that he said, don't put it out, and you're like, you know, throwing your toys out the pram. I want to say. I want to say it. How old are you? But you still want to put swearing out. So it's a discussion about the Radio Authority and the way people are interested. Yeah, but I'm annoyed because you've been at it since about half past 12. I know. Well, I like to get in early to plan the show. Yeah, but there's been no planning. So to be honest, I turn off today. Anyone listening? Because there's nothing, Carl. There's never anything. There is. There's sometimes some good things, but Today. Seriously, what is that? Something half decent that's been on this show. Loads of little interesting topics. I can't remember any. Right. Gazing toilets. Yeah, not particularly interesting. Fascinating to you perhaps. Right, well I'd prefer to hear that than just a load of swear words. We wouldn't have heard any swear words. We'd have heard some bleeping. Right then. So that's. That's entertaining in isn't it? Load of bleeps. It's because you don't want to stand up to your boss or saying don't get annoyed. Stand up to all if. If I agree with what I'm arguing about but I'm not falling out with him over some crappy thing you want to play out. Don't say crap. Doesn't matter. I'm not here next week to tell you that I've can this in. Don't say if Andrew is listening. Don't ask me. Player record. We apologize for the word crap. That's out of order. Big Sam the thrills on XFM 104.9 started off another nice atmosphere again in the studio. Don't blame me, it's not my fault. No, I know, I know. Well, it's your fault mainly. Yeah, you are bad. You are quite bad. But don't. Come on, don't. Come on. You are. Don't try and win him round just because he scared you. I don't know who's that against? Is it me? I am. I don't know. It's you. Right, well I'm not a coward. No, I'm not a coward. Okay. I'm just. I'm just thinking of the listeners, Rick and I just want them to be entertained. Yeah, luckily that's not a big problem for us. What you mean we're effortlessly entertaining or there's no listeners? Well, yeah, somewhere. Somewhere in between. Yeah. Carl, what's happened to you this week, mate? Now it's happened. Come on. Well, nothing's happened. Come on. I came in, I came in and he had an hour lunch break. You know, he's sitting. Never get to break. I came in one day, it was out for an eyes and I sat a little chat with Andrew Phillips about, you know, where we were going with the show. You know, where are we going with it? You can't with anything. How far we can run it into the grave. Yeah. No, if we go off air it certainly won't be through being cutting edge or controversial because people just turned off because it's too boring to listen to crack. But he was out for an hour. Having a lunch break for an hour, saying he's too busy. I know, yeah. It's interesting, actually, on the subject of that, I noticed Dan here has emailed in. He says, I was listening to last week's show and I think Carly's taking his job for granted. I'd love to swap with him for a week. My qualifications are that I can press play on a CD player and stop. Carl, what do you think of that? And it can come in next week. Seriously? It says, don't get ratty, Carl. Dan, email me, you know, me address. Email. It'll be sorted out. You can be here next week. Dan suggested we could call it Carl Idol, where people audition each week. Or perhaps Bone Idol. Bone Idol. Brilliant. Have we got a monkey news, Kyle? Don't know if can be bothered. Play a record player. Record pretenders kids on XFM 104.9. That's professionalism, isn't it? Yeah. That is unbelievable, Ricky. I mean, I don't know if I can describe it, really. The scene you were going, mentally, you were shouting. You were really being quite an unpleasant character. Well, the mics. Come on, Rick. And you're absolutely funny how people get annoyed. We don't know if we're here next week. If Andrew gets annoyed. I was going, I went, this is entertainment. He pays us to entertainment. We haven't done anything against the law yet, have we? Or offensive or against the radiatory. Carl said, crap, but I think we'll get away with that. Yeah. So what is there to worry about? Let's just draw a line under the beach. Yeah, let's start again. Come on. Can we just hug and make up? Can we just have a big kiss? Yeah, Come on. No, don't that just. Carl, what have we got? What's on the list? We've done swearing. We've done swearing. That's that sorted out. Well, no, your point was more that you. Weren't you interested in. In why swearing people find it offensive? Yeah, a little bit. Because that seems obvious to me. Because you were saying yesterday that you never understood why people find it offensive, weren't you? That's right, that's right. Yeah, but you. I know. Well, carry on. Yeah, but that's what I was saying to you, why you can't do it on the radio. Because people find it offensive. For some reason they don't agree with it. But some people do. Yeah. I'm saying everyone swears, bleep it out. I will BLEEP it out. Bleep it out. That's my. That's my theory. But you say that everyone swears. Not everyone does swear. I don't know why you've got this in your head that everyone swears. I'm convinced everyone. What, everyone? Like, you know, religious people. Jesus. I bet Jesus swore. Right. What's your evidence for that? No, I'm just thinking. I mean, things are better now than they were back then. Right? Right. He's wandering about in his sandals, getting pebbles stuck in there and stuff. That's annoying. Nails in his hand. That must have hurt. What I'm saying is offensive. No, it's not. That's blasphemous. No, but what. I. Don't laugh. Don't laugh at the crucifixion play record. I'm not. I'm not laughing at that. That is terrible. No, you can email in if you want to complain, Carl. Yeah, not talking to xsm.co.uk it wasn't offensive, though. I'm just saying it's a fact. When you stub your little toe, you let out a little. Do you think it's an effing and jeffing? So the kind of ancient Hebrew version of effing and jeffing. Oh, I'm worried about this. I'm worried about this. This is naughty. No, it's not. Yeah, it is. Just. Oh. When did you start swearing? I started swearing at school. Right. I hope you haven't offended any Christians. Right. There's a ladder at my school. Right. Who got caught swearing? I mean, I got caught and I got. When you said got caught, how were you? What was it? You were behind the bike shed having a swear. Have you got any emf? No, I've only got one C left. It's my dad's. Come on, let's have a go on it. Let's have. Let's say Hunt. Yeah. Let me say the aunt. Now, tell the older kids to buy you some swearing. Just smoke it down to the car. Yeah. So you're behind the bushes having a swear. Yeah. And a teacher hears him say the S word. The S word. The S word. So the way this teacher dealt with it, he said, right, it's not a clever word to use. And he tried to make him get sick of using it by. He had to write an essay using that word 300 times. Right. Yeah. So I would have loved that. But that was just practice for a kid. But that is like. That is like the. The father catching the kid with a cigar and making smoke. Yeah, yeah. Doesn't work with heroin. If you've got A young teenager who's jacked up for the first time. Yeah, it can be dangerous. The funny thing is, though, right, his mom found his textbook, of course, thought he was depressed and wanted to take him counseling because everything was s. He was writing down this is. And did it work? Did he. Did he. Did it wean him up? Yeah, the teacher. I mean, he. He disappeared. He got kicked out for hitting a kid on the head with a bit of wood. So it wasn't you, was it? Long further. That's great. That's the Kachun. I'll just give a big shout out. Rick, go on to John K. He's listening online in Los Angeles. City of Angels. Brilliant. It's his first time listening to the show. Who knows what he's making of it. I wonder if we should explain what Carl is to him. He's up early. Well, he's got up, apparently, to record it and then he's gone back to bed. All right, so he's listening to any time, so. Oh, yeah, exactly. Carl, explain what he is. Well, he's a little bit of a grumpy, spoil, lazy Pratt at the moment, but usually he's quite a funny, nice sort of genuine guy who's in awe of the world if it's furry and doesn't really care if it isn't. Anyway, we're all one big happy family. Come on, Kyle. Attitude up. Happy, Happy. If we're happy, the listener is happy. We were talking about schools, swearing kids at school. I. I just remember at school, loads of my friends now are becoming teachers. Yeah, I just. I can't imagine what it must be like in an environment, kids. Because when we were at school, I mean, not particularly me, but lots of people in the. In the class, and you'd all end up doing it, would just treat teachers like they were. They weren't humans, like they were just creatures from another planet that were there to be tormented. Yeah, it's a game, isn't it, to see how far you can wind someone up to distraction. Most people grow out of that. But is it? Because not everyone, but especially they've got a bit cash in their pocket and a little bit of success. They tend to think that that gives them license to treat people badly. It's terrible. But over there, as a guy, this is such a terrible story. There was a teacher, he came in and he was teaching us. And one kid, one of the hard nuts, he'd found out that this guy, he lives on his own and he had a cat and the cat got run over and so we got in early, like, everyone was in early. And before the teacher came in. And this kid drew a picture of a cat being run over by a car in chalk on the blackboard, a huge picture of it. And the teacher just came in, saw it, burst into tears and ran out. And the thing is, that was like the beginning of term, so he could never get us back after that. There was never going to be any respect for him. It was just like. Remember now, Thinking about it. Just thinking. I mean, at the time, I'm thinking it was bad, but now it's just heartbreaking. It's devastating. I know. It's just. They just forget. They let their guard down a little bit. Did you ever do the one where you just. Just humming? Yeah. And then. And he'd tell us to stop it. And then everyone just. We used to. There's one teacher me and my mate used to go up to, and. And just when we talk, the other one just sort of sniff him slightly and then sort of like, sweet. So he goes, what? I got nothing. And he just. He'd walk away sniffing his armpit. But those kind of mind games. It's like. I know once, right, I was talking this in the week, actually. We had this teacher and he must have been sort of like. Sort of 60 then, right? And we're all about sort of like 12. We had to do French. You had to put your thing on the booth and it was a. I told you something. Repete cats on the wall, right? And you'd repeat it in French. And of course everyone was going to F C. Just like. Just for fun. And he heard this and he listened back to all of them and he realized. And he went mental. He went, I don't believe this. Do you know how much these cost? He was going around, he was going red and bursting, like Carl was earlier. And it was like, I just. I can't stand this anymore. Anyway, he picked up an exercise book, said, look at this exercise book, look. And he went, so and so, look. Oh, look. Oh, look, he's put. And I'll change his name, Smithers. He went, oh, look, he's put Smithers is shit. Oh. Oh. He goes, oh, he's got Clever on this side. He's put, Smithers is a lump of shit. That's good, right? And he went berserk. He went, oh, look, he's drawn a picture of a penis with wings and he's written underneath Dicky Bird. He went, is that clever? He went, do you want me to put a piece of paper up so you can come and write swear words and draw ladies genitals all day. And I went like that, laughed. He went, I'm glad you think it's funny, Mr. Gervais. And he stormed out. Oh, God, yeah. And did he ever come back? No, but we put the bit of paper up for him and said, look what we've done. You said, that's a fanny, there's some knobs. Was it biology? No, it was French. Oh, French, of course, yeah. I just remember things like games. Like there was some cupboards at the back of the. One of the maths class and one kid just got in the cupboard before the teacher came and then sat in there for like, you know, 45 minutes. And just towards the end of the thing, just came out. Brilliant. Just came out and just went, oh. And sat down and just. Just things like that, which just kind of. It's not. I don't know what it is. I don't know what. It's just about a lack of respect. I played a trick like that once in my first year at college. This is pathetic, right? We're on a hall of residence, right? And there was this woman, sort of middle aged woman, come around in a twin set. And I think she was from a bank where she was doing students can do a bank account. And we knew she was coming up the corridor and she was not right. And so my mate got in my wardrobe in this little room, right? Just sat there. She came and said, I said, have you bank? I said, yeah, I'll bank with her. She said, okay, can I just do it? And there was a knock on the wardrobe, come in and he just came out and I went, I went, all right. And he'd left, right? And she just looked at me and I started laughing. I went, sorry. She went, you're not interested? I went, no, but it just fell flat. It fell flat. Oh, dear, oh dear. Carl, a little bit happier now. Yeah. What have you done this week? No, what have you done this week? Doesn't bother me. Carl, answer the question to the producer, what have you done this week? A few things. Oh, it's funny, right, because when he's moaning about, I was telling about I'd caught him out, he says he doesn't get a lunch break. He'd had over an hour and. And then he went. I think he went quite early that night to get a hobby delivered or something. So. And I said to. Was it James Hyman? Was it, wasn't he? And I said, james, he's always complaining about working, does he Work hard. And he went, well, he doesn't work as hard as he used to. Play a record. Can't we? Interesting. Don't want to really hit the start button now. I might do it in a bit lazy. I'm not saying you're lazy. I'm saying, you know, maybe some people don't think you work as hard as you do. That's the. That's the way of the world. I'm not saying you don't work hard, just reporting speech really, at the same time and calling him a liar. Play a record. Can't be bothered. Play a record. Carl. I reckon we could do this all the way through. Billy Bragg. Play record. No, let's not ruin. It's not Billy Bragg's fault. It might have been Camelot for Jack and Jacqueline. He's written some good tunes. Oh, Billy Bragg. That's one of them. Yeah. Waiting for the great leap forward. What station are we on? Xfm 104.9. Yeah, with Carl Pilkington. Carl, wasn't it so far? Well, you weren't up for it and now it's turned out great and you're. Are you a little bit happier? Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's good. Yeah, Good. Just talking earlier about teachers. Weren't they? You've got any amusing anecdotes about teachers or anything around that subject? I didn't, I didn't. I didn't go to school. That much gone when I did, it was. I was telling Suzanne about the other day how, you know, she goes out with me now and she thinks I'm, you know, I'm great. She's, she's, she's lucky what she's got. No, no, she's done well. Yeah. But I was the sort of kid who she would have hated at school because I never had like a pen. Oh yeah, I know. Never a pencil case or any stuff. I'd start off the, like the term, I would. And I've like, you know, a brand new carrier bag with me stuff in. Brand new carrier bag. Classy. And well, you got to have somewhere to put the stuff you've nicked from Woolworths in. Right. So, so that, that be there. But then by the time, like a couple of weeks down, I put my pen down, I would have lost it. And then I'm sort of going around saying, can I borrow a pen? He didn't try sticking up your nose. He's not still lodged up though. It's not, it's not. No, no. Well, the, the funny thing with like, you know, you were talking about teachers and stuff. Were you disruptive? Were you a disruptive kid when you were causing trouble? No, not really. I was one who wouldn't cause troubles. Terrified of the boss here and he. No, it's not that. It's just that. What's the point in winding people up? I find it quite annoying if people do that. So I don't wish it up on anyone else. Why do you wind Steve up, then? I don't wind him up. You have done. But come on, let's just not. Let's not argue. We were getting on well, then. Come on, Carl. And like the teachers, because I'd lived on this estate, right, loads of stuff used to get nicked and go missing and what have you. Blackboards and their way. No, like the T in the video. Television, stuff like that and the projector thing and all that. So the way they used to try and find it. Right. My little conspiracy. You know, I'm good at them. Yeah. You. Well, yeah, yeah. What they used to do is set your own work and say, right, draw like a bird's eye view of your house, right? But draw everything you've got in your house as well. So if you've got. I don't know, if you've got anything in the loft, make sure you draw it right. So people with kids would come in with overhead projectors. Well, that's. That was the idea. Guns. Yeah, yeah. The aircraft guns in the shed. So your. The picture you did at your. For your home, presumably. Got nothing from me. Nothing. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I'm not. He used to hand it in. Empty house. I'm not a grass. Ignore the illegal immigrants living in the. Kitchen of your Auntie Nora. Yeah. What's that? Is that. Have you been stealing tennis balls? No, that's not a split tennis ball. That's my arm. But what about all the stuff. Didn't you have to draw the stuff that your father had nicked? All this, you know. Listen, listen, we're doing Songs of Phrase today because Rockbusters has gone. What? Songs of Phrase again, I can't remember. I think I've blanked it out. Yeah. When we do something that's been said a few times on the show. Right, Right. It's been said a few times. I'm scared of Andy Phillips. I need my job on it. Go on. Sorry, you were speaking. Carl. So we take a phrase from the show, right, and just get songs, like the words from the songs, edit them together. So something. Yeah, something like that. Yeah. Okay. Let me just. Go on. Sorry. Go on, Carl, Come on. So are we doing it? Sorry. So, yeah. So what's the phrase you've come up with? The phrase is. Is. Is. No more Cheeky Freak of the Week. No, no. More Cheeky Freak of the Week is. They're not. We're not having that anymore. Well, no, because it's offensive. And if we're worried about offending people to talk about people with disabilities, like conjoined twins and women who are born with, like, deformed legs. Dog. Woman. So, you know, you've got to be careful. You've already. You've already insulted. Christ. Let's not do disability. Let's do Songs of Phrase. Chicken Freak of the Week was never out to offend anyone. No, it wasn't to make you realize. We don't try and offend people, we try and entertain them. Right. Do you know the funny thing is. You know, the funny thing is, right, you're saying about, you know, being cruel about people and stuff. It goes on all the time on the news the other night. You know those Siamese twins that didn't make it through the operations. Right. And this is why I'm stopping it, because I don't want people to think we're having a go at disabled people and stuff. Right. On the news. Right. Yes. Before that operation, the doctor said, we're going to try and sort this out. All the doctors are going to get their heads together. Is that a good phrase to use? Yeah, yeah. See what I'm saying, Carl? Play record. No, I'm just. Are you offended Rick? Are you? Or you've offended Rick with your race. You're the one that's. Yeah, but I'm saying we're not out to offend anyone yet. It's always going on. People are always trying to entertain. Please don't bring it down. Play a record. I ate it. Darkness growing on me. You love the darkness, don't you? Yeah. I was lucky enough to see him. People told me it's a bit. It's a bit too jokey or a bit too tongue in cheek. But it isn't really, if you don't know that. It sounds great. It just sounds like sort of retro 70s rock. Yeah, that's great, I think. Brilliant. It's nice to have rock back, I think you'll agree. Big time. Yeah. High five, man. Yeah. Yeah. Sweet, sweet, sweet. Songs of Phrase it's the mighty return of Songs of Phrase. No one has requested that it's not, not, not due to public opinion A. Lot of people have requested some swearing. They have indeed. But we had a lot of emails for that. But go on, Carl, and remind us again, what exactly songs and phrases and why we should care. It's just a phrase that we take from the show. Make up by taking words out of a song, edited it together. Right. The phrase that we're doing is no more cheeky Freak of the week. No more cheeky. It sounds like this. Right. So, no, that's not impossible. You got to email in with all the songs that you can hear there. Right. There's things. Five songs. And we just want the names of the songs. Yeah, that'll do. Okay. All right. Do we just hear it again? All right. Yeah, it's good. It's probably one of the best you've done. It's very tricky, though. I mean, that's not too tricky. Play it again. How many have you got, do you think, Rick? Just. Oh, well, I've. I've noticed the same person singing twice. Is that right? In a band and solo. Yeah. And. And I know one track straight away from the word. Can I just say, I do think naming the songs is a bit tricky. Let's just name the artists. Is that all right? Just the artists. Just the artists. Just change the rules slowly. Yeah. Before we play it, just let you know what the prizes are. We've got on DVD later with Jules Holland. Louder. Lots of the alternative acts he's had there. A DVD, there a couple of DVDs. With piano over the top. Let's hope so. Brilliant. I can't wait. On this area Phonics, we've got Sonic Youth, Ash Hole, Queens of the Stone Age, Foo Fighters. Quite good. Once again, Cruise of the Gods on dvd, starring Rob Ryden and Steve Coogan. That was on a Christmas. It's not bad. It's not the same one. They haven't been sending that back. We've been giving out different ones. Indeed. This is an album just called, quite simply, I love you. And you'll be pleased because there's the likes of Mel C, Cliff Richard and the Holly on there. Brilliant. Excellent. The best chill out album ever. We've got the Beach Boys on there, obviously, Pink Floyd, Coldplay. That's not bad. And this is the one that's most interesting, I think. The American Song Poem Anthology. I've not heard it yet, but apparently I think what it is is an anthology of recordings that were made apparently in, I think, maybe 50s or 60s America. You could. There was a particular organization you could send in songs or lyrics that you'd written at home and they would send it to music and record it for you. And this is a compilation of them. So obviously it's. There's some quite idiosyncratic and odd little things on there. I think it's probably worth a listen. So not bad prizes at all. Carl, let's play it again. Well, as we got, we started that going. Just the artists then Ricky Gervais. Xfm.co.uk ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk Once more, Carl. See, we're just great. Yeah, not bad at all. A little bit of elbow. Nice to hear. Then again, this is the 1. Red XFM 104.9 elbow and red Good chin. The old Spanish archer. All right, yeah. Elbow. Sorry, you've lost me. I wasn't listening. Elbow. Elbow. All right. Sony award winning from Ricky Delays. Well, we're not allowed to do anything. Andrew likes those sort of things. Rick, I can tell you now that the, the answers to Songs of Phrase are quite literally dribbling in. I think there's two, maybe three answers so far. So very excited about that. And we just had an email from Dan. He says, My Mrs. Lynn is pregnant and is eight days overdue. Carl, could you offer any words of encouragement to coax the baby down the birth canal? I've sat Lin only inches away from the speaker to allow optimum audio transfer to the uterus. What would you say to that child there? Just to lure it out to the wide world, Carl, I wouldn't rush out. It's not good, is it, out here? Sure. I don't really want to talk about kids either because Suzanne's mates just had one and now she wants one. Oh God, yeah. Please never bring a child into the world, Carl. Promise us that. They just bore me. Have you seen, there's loads of people in the office who have got them now and they've all got baby pictures everywhere and they're all like, isn't it nice looking? It's like, no, it's not. They all look the same, all like. Mel Smith, don't they? It's that theory actually. Right. You know, I've said before about babies, right, but like little old people. Yeah. There was no another of the great theories. No, no. The fact that you know, you're born and you sort of, you know, you've got no teeth, you got a little bald head, you can't control your, your bodily functions and that. Sure. Then you get to like. So you're describing yourself. Yeah, I was saying you've got Dangerous ground. You're saying that's how you're born? Yep. Then you get to about 70 or whatever. Yeah. All that starts to happen again, doesn't it? Right. Yeah. Now there was a story in America about just backing this up again. 70 year old fella. 70 year old fella. Okay. Little bald head. Yeah. Right. Probably no teeth. No probably, yeah. Nappy enough, right? Yeah, probably, yeah. Pop the old nappy on your 70th birthday. Take your teeth out, goes into an. Off license to get some beer, doesn't get served because he didn't think he was old enough. Right. Okay. Right. Okay. Carl's back. Carl's back. Wait a minute. Sorry. So they thought he was baby Steve. Forget it. Carl, please. No, I mean that's a story. But it's weird, isn't it? That's what I'm saying. It just backed up. License thought that a giant baby year. Old wrinkled baby in an overcoat sucking Werther's original smoking apartment going. I can't believe it. The price is not the same as they were right was a small child. Yeah. Weird nit play record. You're an idiot. Well, what's happening with songs? Afraid. Forget it. As I say, the answers are. Are dribbling in and can we. Can we run this radio station for a week? Yeah, but the thing is if we genuinely wanted to do a good job at that, we'd have to fire ourselves straight away. No. Do you know what I mean though? Just sort out the playlist. Let DJs, you know what I mean? Sort out what can be said and what can't. Just for one week. Yeah. See if we can give it a bit of ah. Shall we? What would you do? I don't know. Just the freeze pissing in the wind. Well, I know. Yeah. Well, are we gonna even meet this week? Because it's, you know, he's wasted time pre recording stuff that we can't put out. I don't know if it's worth still on that. He is still on it. I mean to be honest, I've let it go, but he's still on it. What else is on the list? What list? On the list. I said to you yesterday, let's sit down, have a chat. I thought it was just a piece of crap. You can't say crap. You should have bleeped that. I know. When you believe that, why don't we. Why don't we pre record the whole show? Then we only have to come in once. What do you think of that? Carl? Carl? Whatever. Carl. Steve. I seriously think, if we put out last week's show, would anyone know? Cow. Cow. Play a record. He's driving me mad. Cow. Seriously. Driving me mad. Cow. Press the button. Sick of it. Carl, Carl, Carl. Black Rebel motorcycle club stop on XFM 104.9. I reckon we could run it for a week just to do. Just to do a few little things. No, but I mean, just like, you know, have a look at the playlist a little bit. Another phrase polishing a turd. I think that's just another one that springs to mind. You don't say that, Carl. What turd? Yeah, I think so. Well, you said it. So you're the producer. That's all right. All right. Yeah. I'll tell you, I've got it together. Capital. Oh, no, that's a classic station. I was. I came in in the week to just check, Carla if he was here. He wasn't. He was out for about an hour or so. And I heard in the lift, I don't know what DJ it was on. He just went and he's talking about that little girl, Summer, who went missing. But then she was just found reading the book. And I swear, right? I. I swear he went and there's a lovely, uh, lovely picture of her there just. Just reading the book. So. What a happy ending. It's a shame they don't all end like that. Oh, God. And he played a record. What's his point? Unbelievable. What's that? I don't know. It's those people who think that they're being a little. What? A little bit philosophical and then just. Everyone goes, oh, thanks very much. Yeah. I noticed in the. The story of Summer, the little girl that went missing. I don't know if you read that. It mentioned her family now. It mentioned the. The father of the house. I don't know if it's her father or certainly the guy that. The parent. That the male parent. And it was like. It was something like. I think. I don't want to, you know, label him, but it was something like. Paul, 24, and he's a graphic designer. Recently changed his name to Dragon. I just wonder what. What exactly is that? How is he family? Is that really? Yeah, you know, I don't want to. I'm always a little bit worried about people who change their name. Certainly to someone to really, really cool. Yeah. Because, you know, Kevin Smethurst isn't, you know, it's not sexy enough. Exactly. So I call myself Clint Iron. Yeah. Yeah. What would you call yourself? I mean, Carl Pilkerton. Nothing wrong with that. It's quite a superhero's name. Pilkington. When I was about seven, I wanted to be called Brett. Yes. Yes. I don't know. I just had a mate who was called Brett and I thought, that sounds good. It's different. Yeah. Yeah. But then I'm quite happy with my name because Carl, I have to say. Where does that come from? Car. Because it's quite an. It's quite a random dream. I forget this. What? Your mother had a dream. She. She wasn't well. She had pneumonia or something. Right. And she had this dream while she was pregnant. That's some doctor sort of, you know, she was going off to another place. She was going to die or something, this doctor. When I can sort this out, I can. I know what I do here. And she remembers on his name badge it said Carl. Really? So when she had me, she said. Right, call him Carl. Doctor. Calling Dr. Pilkington. Calling Dr. Pilkington. She hoped, I imagine, that you'd grow up to be like him in every way. I've done all right for myself, I think. Sure. All right. Yeah. This is what we were talking about, actually, weren't we? We're talking about the fact that you're quite proud of the fact that you. You. You've got no formal education, really, and yet you've pulled yourself up with the bootstraps. Yeah, well. Well, I know. I know people who've got results from that and don't do. Don't do anything. Sure. Do you know what I mean? Go on the streets. So I've used all my energy as I've got older, rather than burning myself out as a kid. Do you know what I mean? Sure. So I don't know if that's advice, is that. Should we advise that to young kids. Like that don't take exams, don't work at school, just, you know, move away from Manchester and get a job on xfm. They'll employ anyone. Yeah. You get an hour's lunch break, you're away by quarter to six. You need. You need no qualifications because you don't. Have to think for yourself because your boss tells you what to do. You can have some time off to go shopping for Hobbs and shower units. He's all right. He's a good boss. Yeah, I know. He'll let me have next Saturday. After all, he knows how tired. How many Saturdays has he had off? He's going away again. Oh, he's had two holidays. He gets 26 holidays. 20 days, six days a year. 26 days a year. It's unbelievable. Yeah, it was sick because he put on wet trousers. Yeah. And now you're going down to hasting. He's leaving early because you left early last time. No, no, I won't do that again. Now, what are you going to Hastings for? Just having a break. Listen, though, we were talking about depressing news, right? And without kid and what have you. Yeah. You see that thing in the week, There was. There was three bits of depressing news, right? There was one. An old woman who swallowed a fork. Who swallowed a fork. And she's dead, the dork. So what did she. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What'd she follow as well? What's her name? She swallowed a cockroach. Right, Sorry. Whoa. Is this. Is this the old rhyme that you've got slightly wrong? You've changed. You've changed dog for fork. This is the truth, is it? This is what you read. Oh, no. Yeah, yeah. Never confuse the two. This is what you read on the Spurious website. Just before you move on from that. There was an old woman. There was an old woman who swallowed a cockroach. Yeah. And to. In order to get the cockroach out, she. What? She swallowed a fork. It doesn't rhyme, but it's good. She. She tries to get it out with a fork. She went. Well, for God, I'm thinking she's in a kitchen. Yeah, that'll do. She grabs that, she tries to get it out and she lets go of it and it goes in the page. The terrible thing was, it was a gardening fork. It was. It was awful, you know? Or is that. Or is that stupid? That'd be stupid if it's a gardening fork, wouldn't it? I'll tell you what annoys me, though, with things like that in the paper. It was what you do and everyone knows that. Honestly. No, Right, you. You do. Me adding people the way people say it must be great. Working with him must be brilliant. It's not. It's a nightmare. Get on with it. I can't be bothered now. Let's just close, because I, you know, I want. I'm interested. I'm interested. Seriously, I am. No, no, no, no. Let me finish the story. Come on. Long links. I'm getting annoyed. I'm getting so angry. All right. Oh, the player recorder. Unlucky man. That's for Carl, who is a lucky man. Two hours every Saturday here. Just a little bit of chat and laughter, some great records. All right? What are you going to Hastings for? Just to chill out. Yeah. What are you gonna do? Just chill out. What specifically is in Hastings that's of interest to you? They having another battle? Nothing's just cheap. You can get a B and b for about 40 quid. Sure. The weather's good, so let's all go. Why not? Yeah, why not? Do you want Ricky to come down with you now? Right, okay. Now you were gonna tell us something before we started winding you up. What we were talking about. We're talking about the old man who was mistaken for a small child. Yeah. The 70 year old who they thought was underage. Right. So we won then we got onto. Right. This is the old woman I was saying. Yeah, yeah. She. She had a cockroach. She ate a cockroach? Yes, by mistake. How did she eat a cock? Why was her. She was clean enough. It jumped in her mouth. So she immediately, the first thing she did was immediately grab a fork. You can plunge that down her throat. Yeah, well, maybe not immediately. I mean, she tried other methods. She tried plastic spoons, her fingers maybe washing it out, maybe going, oh, I nearly swallowed a cockroach. Did she try that one? Oh, yeah. How horrible. Right, so anyway, the fork went down. Yeah. And it's got this picture in the paper of like the X ray. You can see. See the fork just like going across like that. Yeah. Wow, that's. That's mad, isn't it? Yeah, yeah. Well, it was where the fort was in her abdomen. Was it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Are you sure she swallowed it? Sure she didn't just say that to the doctor? How did he get in there? You've got a fork inside. No, I know what you're getting because I remember years ago. Do you know Dr. Steele? Do I know Dr. Steele? Yeah, on. He does the one on Richard and Judy. Right. What's he a psychiatrist or the reason. He just pops in like the suave, sort of. Normal doctor fella. Sure. And yeah, this was like in the 90s and rich and Judy said, we got the doctor in the A again today we're looking at things that, you know, have been inside people. And there's this one, right, fella comes on with an X ray. It's sat on a pint glass. Sat on a pint. That's what he hadn't had it sat. On a pint glass. I remember, I remember that story that was published about the bloke and this is the excuse he gave to a doctor when he had to go and have something removed. It was a bottle of sort of HP sauce or something of his. What word can we say in case. Andrews, you don't need to. You know. People know what you're saying. Okay. Rectum. All right, no, you didn't need to say it, but. Well, it might as well. It's his medical term, innit? Anyway, anyway, so the doctor got it out and the excuse. He said he been shopping. Been the Safeways. He bought his shopping home and he popped the shopping on the. On the front step and he realized he's locked himself out. So he started to shimmy up the drain pipe, but his trousers and pants fell down while he was climbing and he slipped and fell on the HP source bottle. Right. And. And that was the night thing. Right. And the. The doctor I'd put at the bottom on his notes. This would be somewhat more believable if Safeway sold their HP source with condoms already attached. Why did he put a condom on it? No idea. To use it again on his chips. So he didn't just. He didn't just buy it to have a quick. You know. Yeah. He thought, well, I don't want to waste it as we. Sauce. Sure. I mean, I use it. I use it at the arsenal on the chips. Safe sauce. I always, always have safe sauce. Red Hot Chili Peppers. Universally Speaking on XFM 104.9. Steve. I'm just going to make every single one of our listeners shrug and kind of give a. Who cares by saying that after the ads. Songs of phrase answers. We've still got monkey news, though, haven't we? Oh, monkey news as well. Yeah. Helen, you're supposed to say something that will keep people listening during the advert. Should we bring back the. No, can't do cheeky figure of the week. Play some ads. XFM. Blackalicious and Deception on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais. Carl Pilkington. Steve Merchant. Well, we were talking just before the ads about. I think we're talking about objects being stuck up people's arses. Okay. I think that was the. Someone can just confirm that was. It was object Objetar. Rcs. Objet. Das. Maybe that's a new feature. Objet. Dart Object. I'm using objects. You've stuck up your French for stuff. Stuffing stuff up your ass. Yeah, but I remember when I. It's not really. It was just about objects and odd things in odd places. I used to work for a magazine when I lived in Bristol. And I remember the editor said to me once, he said, oh, we got a page to. We gotta have a page to fill. They would do the usual. Phone up a hotel and ask them what the weirdest objects they've ever found left behind in a hotel room are. This was something they did every year. They just did a name. We phone up the local hotel and I found out I can only remember two of them, but they have stuck in my mind. These were found. I think it was the Marriott Hotel in Bristol. They were found by cleaners. A chicken. Yeah, a live chicken in a hotel room and that was just left behind. And a false leg. I mean, I don't know who. I don't know who leaves behind a false leg. I mean, presumably you'd notice if you didn't have your false leg because you'd be lying on the floor. But. But I just remember. Well, yeah, I don't know where else you'd find those two objects, except perhaps Paul McCartney's farm. I've always thought to myself, who left behind a false leg? Maybe the chicken pecked it off. Well, possibly the person with it just like went and goes. So much different. I keep falling over. Yeah, I don't know why. And where's my chicken? Yeah, she probably called later and said, did the cleaners find chicken and false leg? I'll check. We. Hold on. We haven't handed in. Ye. I don't know. We've got it. We get a lot of chickens and false legs left behind. What was it like? Yeah, it was just a wooden thing with a. With a foot. Has it got a foot on the end? Well, yeah, yeah. We might have found it. It might be yours. In pirate films, they always had. The pirates would have the peg leg, which was just a piece of wood. There was no effort to make it look like a leg. I don't know why it didn't dawn on them then, to make it look more like a leg. I mean, I don't know at what point I'd like to. Quite. Quite like. Do you know what? Really be that interested. But I'd be marginally interested to see the history of. It was fashion, because I didn't wear long trousers then, so they all stopped at the knee. So why. Why are you wearing long trousers? No reason. Let's have a look at your legs. Yeah. Oh, it's more embarrassing, you see, if you hide it, it's like they had a hook. Why didn't they have a glove? A hook is never a good idea. It's not a practical enough thing. It is if you're absent between two buildings in a hurry because then you can just use it straight down the wire. But I mean, a hook is such a grotesque thing. I mean, You. Because I don't have a go at them. But, I mean, there's no one except that weird guy who's up in North London who's still got a hook for a hand. Well, I think it is useful. Well, no, it's good for carrying bags. Yeah, Shopping. Carrying, shopping. Do you think that's. That was the concern of pirates? Well, then, Tesco, I. Well, I mean, they didn't have, like animatronic sort of stuff then, did they? No, but it's just so. I mean, you know, if it's just not very flattering. Is it a hook? I mean, you know, James at school. With a kid who had lots of different things like knife, fork, he could screw onto the end of it. That's brilliant. Now, that is brilliant. That's good. That's almost as good as having a head. Yeah, for the canteen. But at school, you'd be the coolest kid in school. Surely a bit more frightening in the swimming pool or on a bouncy castle. Yeah, but, yeah, for. For chopping up a bit. For chopping up a bit. Imagine him being banned from the bouncy castle. You can't let him on. Oi, Hooky, get off. You're not welcome on here. Like to apologize for some of the things said in today's show, but what. Happened when he started asking girls I own stuff? Imagine he spent a lot of time with his hands around his back. Oh, God. With a sore spot on him one, probably. And I can get out with this one. Yeah, that's handy. There's a fella in ward too, that's got a shopping bag. Just pop it up there, pull it out. Shopping intact. Done. Anyway, it's going to Hastings in 10 minutes and. Yeah, can't wait. He's looking forward to it. Lovely day, lovely town, nice little trip, chill out, come back refreshed Monday. Ah, let's do some work. What does the boss want me to do? He's done you there, Carl. I was letting it lie and he comes back with that after we were getting on. So who's the winner? Answers. Well, let's give us. Give us the answers first. Right. I'm calling it Rock, but just because I ordered to change it. All right, Paul McCartney, cheeky girl, sugar Babes, Space and Beatles. Okay, brilliant. You've really. I mean, if you're not interested in it, Carl. Seriously, mate. Anyway, we're going to give the prizes, which are pretty good this week, to James Waters from Colchester. Well done to him. He's got them pretty much right. Where's Dicky Anderson. Not over from Dicky Anders for a long, long time. Because I wanted to. If there's one show I'd wanted to hear, it was this one. Because we've pulled out some of the stops now, haven't we? He's excited because he's going away, so he's putting an extra bit of. Ah, come on, let's play a record. Let's play a tune. Then let's come back with monkey news. We have some monkey explain with. Placebo and this picture on XFM. 104.9. 8 minutes to go. Let's make it a good 8 minutes and then we can all chill out. Yeah, Enjoy the rest of the weekend. Play the jingle. Oh, chimpanzee that. Monkey news. Excellent. A particularly aggressive jingle this week. Wow. Yeah. Looking forward to this Monkey news. Carl. Right, come on. So what's her name? What? What? Brilliant. We've done. We've done a lot of monkeys who, like, got involved in crime and stuff. Yeah, right. We had the one on the train station nick in a bag. Yeah. We had the one who went, okay. Went into a bank and walked out with the money and stuff. Yes, right. Didn't happen either. Next. But the thing is, you never sort of found out what happened to them if they sort of got worse, Got more involved into update. Brilliant. What they found out in India is. Yeah, it's got a prison. It's just for monkeys. You mean. You mean wild animals, you mean? Yeah, yeah. A zoo or a kennel or something that. Where they've. They've. It's been garmental or something. It's a prison. Yeah. Is it? Does it have fraud cases? It's got mainly sort of animals that are attacked things. And it's mainly violence, I bet. Has my. That and that and festival. Second stuff first. Say it again fast. Say it again. Robin. No, let's go back to that word. We're gonna keep doing it. You've got. We've got six minutes. You're gonna say the word, right. Before you go to Hastings. Well, do you say it? Well, all right. Robin, then. It's been caught. Robin. Say it again, though. Who's Robin? Who's Robin? So they've got this present. This is extraordinary. Say it again. No. You're not gonna say it? No. Go on then. So they got a prison forum, right. And there's 11 of them in there. 11 monkeys, right, that are in there for life. Because that's. I think there's. One just got out on parole. Right. No time off. There's 11. There's 11. I'll give you the bit of paper because I thought this was. You thought it was a bit weird. Now, Carl. What? What are they in there for then? Because I mean, they're in there for life. So I'm assuming it's murder. Is it premeditated murder? They're not crime bosses, are they? They're not prostitution and gambling. Are you sure they're not just the pawns and the. And the head, sort of like orangutans up a tree going. Remember, you don't know me. You're on your own. If I go down, you're all coming with me. Take some of your gorillas down there and sor. Oh, the great banana robbery. I wonder if they'd get them. Right, go on then. Okay, let me see now. I don't know what source this is, as ever. Is it back of a fag packet found in the toilet? Well, no, I mean, someone's clearly. If this is nonsense, then someone's clearly gone to a lot of effort because it does open with the headline parole unlikely for inmates of monkey prison. Yeah. Officials say 11 inmates at India's only monkey jail. Officials now what kind of people work at a monkey jail? Where do you work? It says, officials say 11 inmates are India's only monkey jail. Are unlikely to ever be released. The prison in Patilia houses monkeys apprehended by game wardens in Punjab state for thieving and attacking people. The Daily Telegraph reports had the monkeys at the prison in Monte Bay snarl and glare at visitors from their heavily barred cages. Two monkeys were released a year ago after exhibiting good behavior for 18 months in the jail. They have remained out of trouble. Prison can work. That's good. So they were aggressive wild animals that were taken away from the public for their own good. Robin or not. Wildlife officials believe part of the problem has been caused by thieves training monkeys to help them. Lorry drivers training monkeys as guards for vehicles and itinerant entertainers using ill treated monkeys. It's the monkey that takes. Makes the wrap. It's a shame. That isn't. That is awful. They didn't know what they were doing, did they? Oh, so there you go. What do you think of that though, Carl? What would you. What if. If you could visit them like Lord Longford or something, what would you. What would you say to them? You go there and they. You get a visit a week or. Something, you know, so can you get us a video? All right. Do they get conjugal rights? Jerking? You would be interested in that though, would you. What's the get? What? Would you be happy to give them their conjugal rights? Yeah. Would you? Fair enough. All right, off to Hastings. Off you go.",

The American Song Poem Anthology. I've not heard it yet, but apparently I think what it is is an anthology of recordings that were made apparently in, I think, maybe 50s or 60s America. You could. There was a particular organization you could send in songs or lyrics that you'd written at home and they would send it to music and record it for you. And this is a compilation of them. So obviously it's. There's some quite idiosyncratic and odd little things on there. I think it's probably worth a listen. So not bad prizes at all. Carl, let's play it again.",
