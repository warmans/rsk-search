Steve Merchant. Claire Sturgis. Claire Sturgis in for Carl Pilkington. Carl Pilkington is on holiday, as we see. Where has he got Mauritius? Was it Madeira? Madeira, I think, with his girlfriend's parents. You remember last week, he was worried he'd never been abroad. And her dad was saying how was to pack tea bags. Yeah. Carl's going, you get him over there. He's going, we can put him in a jar. I go, put him in a jar. I phoned him up in the week just before he went, I think Friday, said, have a nice time Sunday. And he said, guess what he's doing now. What? He said he's packing margarine. Of course he is. Oh, bless him. My dad does that. My parents always take teabags wherever they're going. Really? For fear of there being some kind of teabag drought in France. Yeah. You know, is it wrong? But, I mean, I don't know, is. It because of maybe English breakfast tea? You can't get over there. But you can, can you, though? I mean, you can. You can get pea breaks. Tea is probably the single most popular drink in the world. I know, but what about the fancy foreign teas, your Earl Grey's and the like? Wow. I don't know. Because I want a good English breakfast. Don't bother me with Earl Grey. I don't know what that cup of tea is. It's not tea to me. It's just. It's laughable. It's weak, it's pathetic. It's just. It's. Ugh. Do you know what? Earl Grey with a little bit of skimmed milk isn't so bad. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Oh, is your husband a fan? We've started. Eh? It's all off already. Sometimes sort of pretending, you know, Sometimes. Pretending we're not close mates. Yeah. All that innuendo and that freaky goggle. I go too far. I sometimes go too far. I do ruin it when I go too far, so it'd be nice. Wow. Let's have a bit of Blur. Ooh. Well. The fat man. We're not out of time. We've got a whole hour and 50 minutes to go on the Ricker Gervaisa Steve Merchant show. Except we have one of those after every record. They're great, aren't they? I think. I think if you were actually like a proper DJ. If you actually tried to do the Dr. Fox thing, I think you'd be quite good, really. But I, I think I only survive doing that sort of post 11pm oh, quiet things down now. Yeah, I love all that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that, that American jock type thing as well. I listen to Saga radio now sometimes. What? It's on digital, I think it's radio for the over 50s. And it plays. It was playing Cliff Richards this morning. It played Sammy Davis Jr. It played down the Beatles Here Comes the Sun. And I was loving it. I was thinking, well, it seemed at your age. Yeah, exactly. And I've got a bad back. I've been playing a bad back all. He's been ill. Don't even start. We haven't worked this week. He's been ill with the flu. I'll tell you this. I, I, I. Wednesday morning, I think it was, I woke up and I had the head, the sore throat, the aching body. And I, you know, I immediately thought, I've got the SARS virus. I really did. I genuinely. Because I've always been a bit of a hypochondriac. I mean, Ricky pretends to be, but I genuinely was petrified. That makes sense. Does it? How can you pretend to be a hypochondriac? No, I am a. I am a hypochondriac. And you are genuinely always ill. You're always sort of. You've always got a bit of a snuffle. So I'm justified in thinking it might be the dead. You're a sickly child. I don't know what's happened to you. So much to do with west country breeding. And you haven't. No, he hasn't. Got normal sort of barriers to sort. Of flu and cold immune system is all. I'm quite a weak child. Yeah, I know. I'll probably die in a garret having written some bloody brilliant poetry. Anyway, so I went online to check out what exactly the symptoms of the SARS virus were and seriously, seriously, I did. I was so panicked. So I went straight online and it was exactly what I had. Well, it is a strain of flu. That's right, exactly. That was the thing. That's what I had. So I was thinking to myself, because it said the incubation period was between two and seven days, I thought, where have I been? That I could maybe have got contact with people from. And then I thought, wait a minute, baftas. I think I brushed against a couple of the guys from Banzai. I know I'm thinking, hang on. Yeah, wait a minute, that makes sense. Yeah. And so I was suddenly getting a little bit eggy because, I mean, there's a lot of. There was a lot of people. There's like 1500 people at the BAFTAs, so any one of them could be carrying it. Yeah. So I was really just panicked. But, you know, I didn't immediately rush to the doct because you've got to wait for ages down there, Dr. Charles. Brilliant. But you've got to queue up for ages because it's down in Swiss Cottage where I live. And I'll tell you, there's some dregs in there in the waiting room. Oh, man alive. People who've just gone in there to read the magazines and they're just sat there. It's. Oh, there's some people who just waste the doctor's time. That's what annoys me. A lot of old people, a lot of saga listeners who just waste people's time. I know I went to accident emergency once, God done again. And I'll tell you, look around and you think, oh, look at all these people. Look at these. They should be hardly. If any of them won't handcuff to. You know what I mean? You go to casual on a Friday night, it's like, oh, awful. Yeah. And there's. And so, I mean, it was that thing. Well, I could either go to Dr. Shah, but that's NHS, or I could go to one of the medi centers. They charge money, Claire. And I mean, I know it's a killer disease, but, you know, I'm not making cash. Yeah, because what if it isn't? That's money wasted. You don't get your money back. I really need him to say you've got the deadly SARS virus for it to be worth the 80 quid, you know? Exactly. And as I suspected that, you know, it was 50. 50. I decided not. I decided to ride it out. Yeah. Thankfully, so far I've. I've not done. No, you're right, you're alright. Okay. So you're alright. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's. That's lucky. So, I know, I phoned him up. I said, I don't think I can work. And I mean, Ricky's a close friend of mine, I've known him for a time now and I really consider him one of my best mates. But I'll be honest with you, you didn't rush around with a bowl of soup, did you? I don't want to catch it, do I? It's not both of us being here. This was the implication. Because it wasn't. It wasn't that you explicitly said, in this relationship, you're the one that's expendable. But that was the kind of. That was the sort of underlying suggestion I felt. No, I just thought. To be honest, I thought I could do it. Day off as well. Yeah. I mean, I thought, oh, well, don't worry then, Don't. Tennis? Yeah. No, no, but I had a. I. I was. What's wrong with you back then? I don't know. I think it's just age. I don't know. I don't get things seen too. So it's just been. Hurts when I tie my shoelaces. That's why I've got. I'm wearing clogs. It's so much easier. What, drawstring trousers and clogs, you know. Once you go to the doctor a lot more, though you don't tend to do it now. Well, I'm not paranoid anymore. I. I had two flashes of my. When my mum died. A cancer. Twice, I think I said, there's a lump. Well, I've been to the doctors twice with him. Yeah. I'm seriously sat in a waiting room with him twice. Well, I just. I just went. Yeah, I thought. I thought. Oh, God. I felt. Felt them. I didn't need to do it then, did I? I naturally just touched my. But we should point out. We should point out that Ricky's mother didn't die of testicular cancer. That it just. No, no, no, no. But I had it, so I thought, oh, God, well, I've got it now and I think I went along once with testicular counts, didn't I? Yeah, you had the testy problem once, because I remember sitting in the waiting room looking through an old Argos catalogue with you for some reason. I think that was the only thing to think. I thought I had throat cancer, didn't I? Yeah. Then, yeah, I think you had a bit of a sore throat, didn't you? But then I think now, I think I got over that. I was just like, yeah, sent me a bit, so. But, yeah, it's just. Why were you fiddling around down below? Because, I mean, it wasn't like. It wasn't like I called on you to do some work and you said, I've got to rush to doctors. I think it was like lunchtime, so you'd obviously be meddling around down there. Well, I know I tested a few times, but I'm never sure in the day. I mean, can't you do that when you first get on? Maybe before go to bed. Not in a restaurant when we're eating dinner. Yeah, but you have to, you know. Certainly not spaghetti and kumquat. Exactly. That confused me. I don't know where the answer. Right off. Meatballs. Oh, dear. But Ricky, just to clear it. You are okay? Yeah, of course, yeah. Just a bad back. Yeah. Let's have a record, shall we? Bit of wrist rinsing, be lovely. Oh, one. Cheering breaks and painkiller on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais. Steve Merchant. Claire Sturgis. Yeah, no, it's. It's good to be here. I'm missing. I'm missing hearing Carl. Actually, I shouldn't mention him because people remember, then they go, oh, yeah, I know. We're trying to pretend, by the way. We'Ve not really said hello to you. I'm. I'm very well, thank you. Yeah, yeah. Do you look forward to these occasions when you get to stand in for Carl? I get a little bit nervous. Is it intimidating? No, it is a bit intimidating because he's. Because he's such a funny man. But, you know, it was like. No, he is. It's not like he's doing it on purpose. It's. You know what I mean? So he's just not. He's a natural, at least. You know what you're saying. Yes, good point. Yeah. It's not all downhill, is it? No, exactly. Yeah. No, no, it would be fine. It's only an hour and a half to go. We'll be okay. Can we talk about. Can we talk about the baftas? I know. I don't want to sort of go. On about, you know, I don't like to talk about. Claire. I mean, what do you want to know? What you want to know? What do you want to know? How many? One. Well, of course. Well, I know how many you want. We're all. Not everyone does, though, Claire. I mean, you might want to remind. Me what in all or. What do you mean? This. This year now? Two. Last year, four in all. So it's four. Two of those are Ricky. Specifically his. Yeah. No, Steve, what I really want to talk about was Ricky's white suit. Oh, yeah, okay. Well, listen, let me explain. Well, never mind all that. 1. It's actually. I bought it for a photo shoot because I'm doing this thing. I've got. I've got a DVD coming out in October and I'm doing the. I'm doing a spoof of the front cover of Thriller. So I bought a white suit and I got it right and I thought, well, I might as well wear that then now and get it dry clean. I thought you blagged. I thought, when I put it on, I thought I looked a bit like Sean Connery as James Bond. Apparently I look like Tattoo from Fantasy Island. The little midget guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Which is, you know, I. I did watch it back and you know, there are some resemblances. At one point I did go de plan, which was. I don't know why. Yeah, yeah, I thought, well, I. Because I. When he suggested he was gonna wear it, I said, that's crazy. I said, it's madness because it just. I knew it would come back and haunt him. I just, it's just I got away though. Well, did you? No, I mean, what was it? I said to you? We were talking about it and he. Said, oh, no, he said. I said. He said, what are you wearing it with a sort of white shirt and a white tie? I went, no, no, I wear a black tie. He said, right. He went, you should do it with the white shirt and the white tie. I said. He went, you know, do that whole Randall Hopkirk thing. And I went, that's what I'm worried about. What? You're worried people think you're a ghost? I mean, pathetic. I just, I didn't think it was a good idea. I just love the way that if you're a celebrity, somehow you're allowed to wear like nonsense, outrageous clothes because it's kind of expected of you because, you know, it was a mentor. It wasn't like Graham Norton going in curtains or Jonathan Ross dressing up as Lawrence. Well, and Bowen. It was just a white suit. But it's just that thing of. It's just that thing of, you know, I am. It's cheeky Ricky Gervais. You know what I'm wearing. I was worried there was going to be chocolate mousse though, or Johnny Vegas was going to greet me and throw up immediately. It was. I was, I had to keep away from people and what you're sitting on. But I tell you what, I think it worked with Anne Robinson, didn't it? Do you think she winked at you when you were. She liked it. She just can't stop that. No, she's made it into a catchphrase. But you made her giggle like a little schoolgirl. I knew it was safe though, to say that thing about her drinking because I'd done a non broadcast pilot with her this year for a friend was the Producer and it's a new show called look who's Coming to Dinner. And the premise is I choose sort of six heroes that are alive. And so I knew it was all right. So I didn't just go out there and start insulting this poor middle aged woman. I sort of knew she could take a joke. She's all right. She's obviously, obviously she's not really like that. So. Yeah, no, but I love the way she just giggled like a little girl. I think she was quite good, actually. I think it's better when she sort of had Libby. I don't think she's as good when she's sort of got lines and she's hitting marks. She's quite good when she sort of like when Peter K. Came on, she went, have you dyed your hair? And he went, have I dyed my hair? What sort of talk is that? Your quote was good though. Peace it all, war. I, I just, I, I just hate it when. Oh God, celebrities get their political, like I've got to say something political because there's all, all that suffering in the world. And I don't know, it's like those things you see in the, the papers where it's, it's got general elections or war. It's got a picture of Billy Piper, just a picture. And she go, it goes labor or. Yeah, it's got, you know, Ross Kemp. No to war. Yeah, but when would that, when would that be influential? No idea. It's sort of like you go, someone's going to. What do you think of war? Go, Well, I don't know, I've made your mind up. Well, no, it's difficult, isn't it? Is it? Is it? Well, yeah, you know, because on the one hand. Well, exactly. On the one hand you could say that, you know, war is wrong because it caused suffering. But on the other hand, you know, that's a knee jerk reaction. Some wars are justified. You know, that's stopping, you know, fascism or, or whatever and you know, like pacifism. Sometimes you have to self defense. So it's not clear. Okay, let's make it easier for you. What do you think of the little black one in Sugar Babes? I think she's brilliant. She hates war. That's me. That's me done there. Exactly. Does that help? Sweat your. Yeah. I don't know when it is influential. Remember when, when the, that young au pair was over in, in America and she got, she got in arrested for the, the murder or the death rather of that of that young child. I forget her name. Do you remember that story, Louise Woodward? Remember there was a whole section in the paper there where there was. I think it was members of Coronation street saying, release her, please release her. I remember you said you fancied her. Who's that? You said you fancied her when it was all happening. Well, I said. He said, I think he was the danger. There was an element of that. Do you know what I thought it was? I would love. I would love you to go out with Louise Woodward. The thing about Wooders. What's she doing now? The thing about Wooders is that she. My suspicion was. My suspicion was that when she came back, back and she'd been cleared of it. She had been cleared of it. Yes, she was. No, she wasn't. Wasn't she? No, I don't think she. I think. No, she did her time and it was, it was. I think it was manslaughter, I think. I'm not sure about it. On the edge of getting well, no, no. Someone knows. Call up. You know, we don't know this, so don't, don't. I think you're right. Either way, it was a tragic, tragic accident. And she wasn't a murderess. That was the clear point. And it just struck me that nevertheless, there would probably be a certain stigma, you know, so she was down, you know, kind of Monroe's on a Wednesday night, you know, looking for a dance probably. There weren't gonna be a lot of guys queuing up for because they were conscious that, you know, she had this certain reputation. Whereas ding dong gentleman Steve. Yeah, I'm happy to step in. You know what, I'd let her babysit because she'd never. She'd be so careful, wouldn't she? You know what I mean? She'd be on real best behavior. Yeah. So maybe we shouldn't be talking about. But I do wonder what she's up to now. Well, if you, if, you know. If. You'Re a lawyer and we've said something wrong, let us know now. We'll apologize quickly. Yeah. You know, if you're out there listening, if you. Good luck and you know. Ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk that's. I don't want my name. I don't want my name attached in case. Get in touch. Yeah. You're free tonight, aren't you? Yeah, I'm free. I'm free for the next eight years, I think. Ten Story Love Song Love song, yeah. Ten Story Love Song from the stone Dozies. Yeah. See, it's not as easy as it looks. It's not. It's not. And I'll tell you it also because I'm a little under the weather still, so that's my excuse. You've had a week off. Concentrate. I mean, I've got cable tv, but there is nothing on, is there? In the. In the daytime. It is just. I mean, I loved today with des and Mel. That's good. He always pops up. I love it when he pops up. Joe Pasquale is an absolute without irony. I really like Joe Pasquale. You know him? Have you met him now? I haven't, no. But I really, really like him. I think he's really funny. He's really good. Yeah. One of his favorite. One of his jokes that I've always enjoyed is why is there a lock on the door of the 247 shop? It's a thoughtful man. It's good. You know, it's open all the time now. I just like his squeaky voice. Yeah. Oh, that's fine. I like jokes, but no, I only caught the end the other day, but it was brilliant. Des was singing. Singing a medley of Buddy Holly songs. He doesn't quite sing, does he? He's got a pause. It's like pulling your punch. Yeah. Do you know, he can't. He can't actually. It's not actually singing. It's talking. It's kind of talking the words. Yeah. But he. He knew buddy apparently, and he toured with him. I am an antichrist. He never quite finished. It's lovely. No, he's great. He's got no, like. He's got no breath. But it's the adverts in between. He is 73, though. He's amazing for it. Doing well, isn't he? Yeah. No, I mean, I. You know, he's a good. Sorry, who's 73? Des O'Connor. Is he seriously? Yeah, I think so. Amazing. Yeah. He's doing well. Yeah. Good luck to him. A toast to Ted o'connor. Yeah. Raise your glasses and all you listening at home. I'd love to see him interview Louise Woodward. Yeah. Do you want to hear some Louise Woodward? I have had some calls, but I. Don'T know if they're true or not, though. Do you. What did you hear? Well, I think one of the. Studying law. No, we mustn't say that shop that she works in. No, no, I'm sure I read the same thing, Steve. Someone said they read that she was studying law, and I think I read that because she knows so much about it. Yeah. Now she just came through the system. Yeah. Never know when it comes. But she has been spotted in various parts of the country selling all manner of things. So I want door to door. Exactly. Hello from Mother Care. We've got to stop this now. We gotta stop this now. It's not fair. It's all water under the bridge anyway. Let's play a record. Let's play a record. No, I'll talk about it later. Yeah, we've just got ourselves in trouble. I think we just need to go and consult our lawyers. Oh, this is a beautiful track. And it was actually in Vanilla sky. So bit of resurgence. This is Salisbury Hill. Brilliant. Peter Gabriel. What a lovely track that is. Souls Reho on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Claire Sturges. You know, if Carl was here, do you know what he'd want now? Probably ads now. Some adverts. Yeah, do you want some now? Oh, it's what Carl would have wanted. Okay, put Carl then. Some ads. XFM placebo and bitter end. Xfm 104.9. Ricky Gervais. Steve Merchant. Claire Sturge is in for Carl Pilkington. Madeira indeed. Is that where the cake's from? Yep. It's named after, I think. Yeah. Excellent. Excellent. It's nice. Nice. Lovely. It's sort of. I don't know where Madeira is. It's sort of off Africa. Okay. But it's I think Portuguese. There are a lot of old people there. There are a lot of. He's essentially a 50 year old man in the body of a 30 year old. Yeah, I know. Yeah. I think. Where is Ricky Gervais? Party by the pool. It was. It was actually really good. I actually. I'd much prefer that. That than. We went to Greece once and we wander in this place by mistake going through this and it was just full of people in Everton shirts and Liverpool shirts and just drinking lager. Oh, where's the fun in that? I just. I can't. For the idea of Butlins. Millions, just millions of families screaming around would drive me mental. Is the most extraordinary place I've ever been to. I went there with a bunch of friends. But I mean not Butlin specifically, just any. Anything. No, I'm not slagging buttons off. It's just the bars themed. One bar themed in the Wild west style. But about a tribute band to Status Quo playing. Really, it was extraordinary. So you walk in the Swing Doors and there's Status Quo playing and everyone else sees all the staff dressed in cowboy outfits and cowgirl outfits serving drinks. I've told you this before, but I sneaked into Butlins. We sneaked in one night and we didn't know what was on and they were serving lager and chips and there's just loads of families and. And lots of northern men in short sleeve shirts and kids running around. So. And so they just arranged the chairs in this sort of dance hall and they went. And now, ladies, gentlemen, the entertainment for this evening is David Copperfield. Not the magician and it was a bloke from Three of a Kind. He came out, he did it all, he did all the jokes, he did all the hello, how are you? Oh, you're nice, you know, to people in the audience. And then his finale was he still in a chair because there wasn't a stage. And he did Classical Gas, Seriously on guitar. And then they went out, right, and he went, thanks. He went off and I stopped clapping and he came back on to get his jacket. Oh, no. Yeah. There was also a girl boy duo and Blue Satin called Joint Effort, which I was loving. And at the end, right, it was on. I think it was on a Saturday night, so people were leaving sort of the next day. On Friday night, they're leaving the next day and the kids and that were sort of going to red coats and they were crying, right, and all the red coats and Joint Effort and they did We Are the World. Amazing. What an amazing night. That was extraordinary. Yeah, they are incredible places. Yeah. Joint Effort. I don't think I saw a documentary. I'm sure I saw a documentary which is finding out what the likes of David Copperfield are up to now. Yeah, and he was a Thatcher, wasn't he? Wasn't he mending roofs? I think so, yeah. I think you're right. They said, would you not, you know, would you not want to be back on primetime tv? And he said, do you know, I. I think I prefer mending roofs. Well, I'm not sure what he's probably. No, he's probably the same as David Van Day with that advert when he said it got to the point where I prefer to sell burgers than records. No, you didn't. You never preferred selling burgers. David, have you watched any of the Reborn in the. I love it. It's Hadley or Cox. It's Hadley or Cox all the way, I reckon. Who's Clocks? We Close our Eyes. We never knew him. What band is that? What band is that? Go West. Go West? Yeah. It's probably the best singer in a sort of stand up. How does it work? Do they get voted out as they go around. Yeah. So Sonia's gone. There's two. Two from the studio audience. Two are nominated. The lowest, I think the lowest people. And then. Then Britain. People in Britain Vote 1 Back on the bus. Why they're doing it in the States. Why didn't they just do it in this country? Well, because it was meant to be. Relaunch their career without prejudice, I assume. And also as an excuse to go to America, I suppose. And people not know him, although fame is creeping in, I think a lot of people recognize Tony Hadley. Yeah. Particularly when he sang True at karaoke. So. No. But is he as good as ever? He's fine. He's a bit dramatic, but it's all right. From your. Sort of your brief pop phase, any of these faces familiar to you? Did you ever bump into them? Oh, no, but. No, you never hung out with Hadley or. No, no, we all lived in the same house. Yeah. Didn't you have a run in with Bucks Fizz? Oh, yeah. Well, once when we. When we were going up to do. We were going up to do a TV show, and our A and R man had just forgotten about us, and we were there. We were at the airport. We didn't have the tickets, and so Buck Spiz were doing the same show. And I remember they tried to smuggle us through. They had sort of like them and their crew, and they just like, showed us the tickets and went through and they went, well, like, that would work. They went. I went, okay, sorry. The two girls stand in the lobby, whip off their skirts. Everyone was sidetracked while you legged it through. Well, I was on the shoulders of Bobby G. And wearing a really long coat. Yes. I am taller. You're not taller in flesh than you are on Top of the Pops. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And fatter. I wasn't fat. You weren't fat? Yeah. No, but I love it. And the other thing I've been watching is American Pop Idol, right. Last night. That's great. Really good. Yeah. This is Simon Cowell. Reuben's gonna win, huh? Is that. Is that the one that Jerry Halliwell is part of? No, no, this is Riley Jackson. What's up, dog? Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell. But Simon Cowell makes so much more sense in that context. Yeah. Because they're all you. You know, you're great. And they do people, they stand up and they clap and he goes, I'll sit down. It was all right. And it makes so much more sense, you know, I mean, over here, it's a bit of a pantomime. Sort of drama queen. But over there, he suddenly sounded. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, but that's. That's the trash TV that I watched. Yeah, but no, Reborn's funny. But again, once again, public are stupid. They voted out dollar that was driving everyone mad and there was fights. They. Why did they really. Because they really were. Yeah, because, you know. Oh, yeah, they really went for it. They voted out Chris Eubank. Yeah. And Celebrity Big Brother. Keep them in. I don't think the public should be allowed to vote on TV shows. I don't think they know what's best for them. It does strike me that, like, in the golden age of eastenders, if people had said, do you want to vote out out Dirty Dan? They'd have gone, yeah, he's nasty. I know. Yeah. That's that confusion either with. With entertainment and punishing people. Yeah. They should keep them in and then make them lose. Yeah. Yeah. So you've had all the. The best of both worlds. What about the new celebrity? I'm a celebrity. Get me out. No. Who's in that? The one. Daniella Westbrook? Yeah. Catalina. That model. You don't know her. Yeah, exactly. The one from Worrell Thompson. Why? Why does he want. You got something up. Something to cook, ain't you? Yeah. The girl from changing rooms. Linda Barker. Yeah. Oh, Phil Tufnell. Who? Phil Tufanol, cricketer. I'll put some money on him to win. I reckon he's gonna win because apparently sort of funny and. And nice and everything and. Yeah. Would you ever. Would you ever do any of those? Absolutely not. No. I do think. I genuinely think if you were in the Celebrity Big Brother immediately, you would be voting it. Literally. It would be. It would be before. It would be before the public get a chance to vote. Yeah. The housemates would have got you out somehow or they'd have left. I might win. I might win by default. They'd have all climbed over the roof like that guy Sandy. Yeah, they all climbed out, like, within the first 10 minutes. I saw Sandy the other day, actually. Still on the run. Get off my roof. I got really excited. Really? Does he look like a wombat up close? No, he looks. He's really good looking. Shut up. No, seriously, I saw him in the hat section at Selfridges because he's a personal shopper telling. Yeah, Jane. Where there's specifically to meet Sandy. Just for, like. Yeah, yeah. I got really interested. What is he watching there? Yeah, he always was. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Does he sign autographs and stuff? I'm sure, no. He calls himself Alex now. What? Yeah. He's not allowed to call him Sound Sandy Selfish wouldn't. What should we say and get him sacked? Getting voted out at Salvages household. What is he, a personal shopper? Yeah, that's the. That's just, to me, the epitome of indulgence. If you've got money to spend on a personal shopper. Oh, I'd love to do that. Man alone. Is that someone who pushes your trolley? No, you just say, can I get one of those? You wait for it. No, no, it's just. It's like asking an assistant. You go, I need some black trousers and some brown shoes and this rains. And I go, okay. And they go and get your range. So you don't have to go. It's not. It's not like. Yeah, but I still love it. But you have to pay for it. It's not. No, no, you don't pay for the service, you pay for the clothes if you buy them. It's not. It's not like Lady Di having Harrods opened for her. So I could walk in there and get Sandy to just eat and trouble. In fact, I'd love you to, but. Could I get him like once he's finished in Selvages, could he pop to the co op for me? No, he can't do that. No, he can't do that. What? Seriously. So there'd be people queuing up, wouldn't there? Well, why Selfridges? You can't. People don't go and shop with Selfridges for the sake of it. To meet Sandy, do they? No, but to get a personal shopper, why wasn't it. Why wouldn't everyone have one? I don't understand why everyone wouldn't have. They're not charging you for it. It. Oh, Steve, you and me later. I'll tell you this, I don't think people realize that Rick, he's going to be inundated. You know. You know, when you go to Selfridges, you will not be able to buy that suit you got for £97. It's a lot more expensive than that. What, you can't. 5. Yeah, you can't. You can't get shoes for £29 in there. I'm not bothering. No, exactly. You see, that's. That's where you're gonna come unstuck. I'd love a great record now, Claire. Okay, I'm going back to Bristol this weekend. I am going to be. I've got £100 to spend, so I'm looking to get a three piece suite. Yeah. Dinner, suit. Yeah. You know, and you know, possibly, you know, I think my sister's back. Neil. Young man needs a maid. What a great track that is. Well, we. Listen, we got some ads again, so don't worry about that. After that, though, the brand new single from Radiohead. Okay. I'm excited. Love radio. I've not heard it yet. I'm sure it's wonderful. I haven't heard it yet, but wow. Put your neck on the line. Yeah. And we got tickets to give away to new Spike Lee film, which is. We've both seen 25th hour. That's good. Which is great. So, you know, look forward to that. Yeah, that's all coming. Plus I would imagine a bit more chit chat. It's one of the great records. Yeah. The new single from Radiohead. What do you make of it? I love Radiohead, so I'm prejudiced and I like just about everything they do, you know, I still play the Bends regularly. I had to replace it on CD because I wore it out, really. I just think it's amazing. I think they're great. They're coming in, aren't they? Yeah, well, they're coming in couples. I think Phil and Ed, who are my favorites, are doing Zoe in a few weeks and I think Tom Yorke is going to be doing John Kennedy on Exposure, doing one of those album playbacks where he comes in. He's so shy as well. He came into Yuda once and he was just so shy. He hated it all because people were looking at him and, oh, he's great. He's brilliant. A toast. Funny head. Don't eat too many eggs, boys. Oh, calm down, you crazy guys. No, we were talking earlier about the fact because I've been ill this weekend, so I've just been lying on the sofa, you know. Doe star. I was a bit feverish as well in the week and I am. At one point I had a real kind of movie. If I'm ill. I like to be like, you're ill in the movies. And I was tossing and turning in bed, I had the fever, I was waking up, I was sweating all sorts. And I keep waking up really early and I'm sort of watching daytime TV for hours. And the adverts that you see in the daytime, I mean, because we do actually work a lot, people think we just doss around all day, but we do actually work. And so I don't get to see TV in the day much. And the adverts. It's not adverts you see at night. I know they're incredible. And it's like. Was it for surgical stockings? Well, a lot of them are either aimed at. They're either aimed at people who. Who basically are waiting to die. Right. It would seem. Or. I love that advert. Waiting to die. But they are a bit like that. I mean, there's a couple. There's one with Christopher. Timothy sat in a pub on his own, just having a pint in the afternoon. I think this was before he. I think it's before he became a doctor. He. He's having a part on his own, looking through the. You know, the. The job. Any vet doctor. I think he's always wanted to play a lawyer. Yeah. And he basically says, in so many words, I can't remember it verbatim, but he basically says, you know, you're probably getting on a bit. You're not gonna be around forever. You could drop dead tomorrow. Have you made provisions for your children and your family and your wife? And I think you at home were supposed to go, oh, Christ, I haven't. Oh, and I was feeling my testicles earlier. They are a bit lumpy. Yeah. Oh, no. You know, I had to bend down quite low to feel them. Exactly. So, you know, I am getting on a bit. Exactly. In fact, what I do now is pull them towards me and kick them up like Beckham with a. Yeah. And on the way back down, I have a quick feel. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Or when the kids come to visit. Yeah. And stop playing with Granddad's testicles. Where have you put them? Where have you put them? We put them on the mountain. Oh, you little devils. Go on with you. Do you want a Werther's Original? And that's another advertiser constantly. Werther's Originals. But. So they've got those. And then they got the adverts, which I always love, which are adverts for any kind of. Of, you know, claims, direct or any of those things. It's just invariably there's a reconstruction of an accident that might have happened. Someone tripping over a paving slab. There's one which is particularly chilling of a guy who. I think he's with his kid watching football and he's thinking to himself, you know, I bet you he's looking, he's thinking, I wish I could join in. And it flashes back and there he is up a ladder on a very shiny surface with no one supporting it. Frankly. Always ask him, trouble. Frankly, I blame him. And it topples for no reason. I don't know why it topples. Wind. Let's say, yeah. Whenever I see it, I always say. He never walks again. Well, he falls off it. Did he smash his face in? Did he fall in a spike? Because if he's gonna go up that ladder on a shiny surface with no one holding it. Right. Did he fall? Did he crack? Did he fall backwards on his head? Did it. Worse still, did he do the splits. And crush his nuts? Worse than that one. He made a considerable lump sum of cash thanks to the effort. Oh, no. All right. His negligence has seen him three grand rushes. Hold on. What? Steve, was there a yokel with a pitchfork looking up as he fell on it? Nothing. Oh, fuff. He fell off. I think he must have bruised his ankle or strained a ligament. That's not enough. That hasn't taught him anything. Well, it's not taught him a lesson. In fact, if anything, it has encouraged him to just be more foolhardy in the future. Because if you're gonna dish out five, three, five grand willy nilly to these people, these lunatics, these oafs, these simpletons. Do you know my. One of my favorite adverts was the one in sort of the back of the. Those glossy magazines you get given away, and there was always an old woman and she'd fallen like in her. In her front porch or whatever, and she was just reaching out, but she was too weak to reach the phone. So it was like you carry a little button around with you that you press. I love the idea of that. She looks so vulnerable. I always feel with those kind of those claims adverts that it's almost like saying. I'm not gonna say it explicitly. Here are some ideas for you. Paving slabs. Is there one near you? Could you have a little trip? Exactly, yeah. If you've got a stepladder. Yeah. I'm not saying anything, but maybe read between the lines. The shiny floor. There is money to be made. There's adverts in the back of those. Do you have an Innovations catalogue? Well, I just read this week. Innovations catalogue. It's being closed down. Got. Yeah, it used to go to something like. Something like 50 million homes or something. I love the Innovations catalog. I. You do think, well, I could do with that because I want. Well, I've never thought that I do. I want to spend money on an advantage in life. Like, you know, I want the power packs and hoverboards and things that like to see through walls. Just that for 1990. They don't work, do they? I bought oxygen. Did you really? I bought oxygen. What do you mean, you Bought oxygen. Well, me and my mate were sort of like running. It was about like, like, I don't know, 1987. Me and my mate Wally, we were doing distant long distance running together. We were trying to get good and I thought, I'll just have some oxygen before the race. Some oxygen. It's there. Free in the air. Didn't work. It just smelled like you were sniffing mints. I didn't, I couldn't get any in. I. I did. I just. What was it supposed to do? Well, you know, oxygenated blood. So you can. Right, Yeah. I don't know why it. I don't. I can't remember, but I was 1999. It was a bit cast. It was rubbish. Why did you buy it? I mean, he was at least doing a job. Doing the job. I was saying, because the problem with. The Innovations catalog is that for the, the few idiots that buy stuff like you, there are hundreds, thousands who just look through it and laughed at the absurdity of, you know, a motorized tie rack. I bought the ABS Master. Who is so lazy that they need that. Yeah, yeah, the ABS Master. I worked for a while, answering the mail, opening the mail for returns. It wasn't the Innovations people, but if that's the kind of middle class version, this was a very much more working class thing. It was how to get hot dogs out of a tin and all the rest of it. And there was stuff in there, was incredible. There was one item that was in the catalogue and it was. I know, like me, you've probably thought to yourself, I just haven't got time to boil the kettle and fill up my hot water bottle. You thought, that takes upwards of a minute and a half to do. What I need is some kind of state of the art kind of plastic container with some kind of blue gel inside, which I put in the microwave. And that heats up, right? So that was what this device was. You put it in the microwave, you buzz it in there for like 30 seconds, saving yourself, you know, a minute of preparation time. And we used to get them sent back. I swear to God, they would send that. They'd be split. Old women saying, I'd heated this up in the microwave, I went to sleep, it split us under and the blue gel scorched my legs. I've got third degree burns and woman. With a scolding call claims direct. But you know what we used to do? I used to say, do they not sue over this stuff? And they, and they told me, they said they never sue. They're not, you know, they're old ladies, they don't realize they can sue. What we normally do is send them a replacement. So I'd have to send replacements back to these old women who had scolded their legs. We didn't even send them the money back. We just sent them a replacement. I mean, unbelievable. Unbelievable. Sometimes I always feel a new pair of tights. At least. At least. And sheets. Bed sheets. Yeah. Oh, dear. Imagine that, though. I did David ABS master. One of those things that, you know, you try it on. Jane bought it for me for a birthday once. And the electronic thing, you put it. On, it hurts, doesn't it? Yeah. Well, I turned it full up, right. And at one point. What's this? Sorry, I don't understand what this is. You try it, put it around you, it sticks to your body and it's electrical charge and it. And it's like doing sit ups every time it does. It's like you're doing a sit up but without you sitting up. Right, right. And at one point I had it on. I'd done it for a few weeks and at one point I was laying on the couch in my pants with this on, watching telly, drinking a bottle of wine and eating cheese. She said, I don't think it works. If this works, it's the greatest invention of all time. It's like you can eat and it's wearing it. It's kind of working it off for you as you're retaining. Oh, dear, that'd be great. I did see one thing in one of those little magazines once, and this is hilarious, right? What it was, it's a bloke, a bloke in a wheelchair, right? And then there's another one of him and it's raining, so he's got a kagool on that covers him and his wheelchair and just a little face. It looks like he covered a motorbike in and it's just his little face. I thought that was great. Oh, dear. Oh, Innovations is finished. Great. It's all over us. We have a record. It be lovely. Toast to the innovation. Toast to Innovations. You provided nothing of much use. 15 years. Happy Easter. Did you exchange. Well, that's it. That's Merton's embarrassment, not mine. He bought that in. He wanted to play a little bit of Pink Floyd. I went, well, yeah, it's a great track. It's a great track when it plays all the way through. Through it is playing all the way through. Is that a bootleg? Well, it is playing now, but, you know, do you want to run the risk Stick with it. Well, it's a great song. Okay, we'll get back to you. Toast to Big Floyd. Happy Easter. Wish you were here. Well, I mean, are you sure that's. Not part of the song? Because you know Pink Floyd, you know what they're like. New fang tricks. Oh, yeah. Newfangled sort of trickery in that weirdness. I mean, like, it's a shame. It is a shame. It is a great song. Yeah. But it. It's too annoying. We got to stop it. Yeah. Are we putting a pay to it? It's gone. Yeah. Switch it off, Claire. I don't know. Because that always plays fine on my home system. So I don't know if it's something that Sturgis has done. You haven't got your big greasy thumbprints over, have you? Because I saw you eating a huge hog roast as I. As I came in and throwing the bones behind her like Henry viii. Nothing changes. Oh, dear. Never mind. Well, that's. See the problem. That's ruined the whole show for me. It was going so well. What worries me, Rick, is because this show is so carefully planned. Yeah, that's left a minute and a. Half that can throw us all out. Timings. Timing adverts. Do you think that people love them? Great. Forget about tomorrow. Wise words. Unless you're talking about pension plans. That's feeder on XFM 104.9. Steve Merchant, Claire Sturgis. Competition time. We haven't got the usual competitions of songs of phrase and monkey news and the other. The other car nonsense. You know, I'm not. There's no cheapest chims. There's no cheapest chimps. So that next week as well. I don't know. Although. Let's do it. Just do a quick. Quick. Cheapest chimps. Okay. Chimpanzee that. Cheapest chimps. Do you know how much a chimp is, Steve? Tomorrow? 55 grand. Okay, the competition is this. We've got five tickets. Yeah. To give away to the new Spike Lee film 25th Hour. And I've seen this and it's really great.

Yeah, exactly. I don't think they're gonna ask for ID on the door, but if you look like 14, there's no chance. And you probably get some fags and beer as well on the way up. But if you're 16 17. And you look old enough. You got a bit of facial hair. Go for it. Yeah, or wear a long beard. Yeah, whatever. Yeah. No, we're not gonna condone that. Please be 18 years or over. It is an illeg. Call 087-008-001234. And as it is such a great film, the competition is this. Do you want to go to this? A, yes. B, no. So, C, I'm not sure I can make it Wednesday. Any chance Thursday? D, I think I'll wait for it to come on video, you know. E, I don't really like Spike Lee. I'm a racist. So hang on, we should just point out that, yeah, It's Wednesday at 6:00. Did we make that clear? Wednesday at 6:00. A, yes. B, no. C, Wednesday's nose. Good for me. D, I'll wait for it. Can't video. E, I don't like Spike Lee hymn. Yeah, what is it? 087-008-001234. That's the number. Yeah. Okay. Bother Claire with that. The answer's A, by the way, correct answer, if you want to go though, is. Yeah. But tell the truth. I'd love to have some more music. Yeah. Sweet, sweet, sweet. Feel some Smiths Reel around the Fountain. Good choice. Smith's Reel around the fountain. Xfm 1 of 4.9. While we've given those away, then. Yeah, it went very well. Have you. Have you got enough now? You don't need. Yeah, Everyone said the correct answer. They would love to go. 1. One person actually, was it. It was Tom said C, but his. His sister Sarah would love to go. Oh, well, good luck to Sarah if he's over 18. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Otherwise that is illegal. Here's to the rules. Cheers. Cheers. I don't know why I'm gonna cheat. I'm just in a mood for toasting things. I just. I think it's because it's. It's Easter. Yeah, yeah. And we know what that means, don't we? God bless him. Eggs. Go on. Absolutely. Well, we were chatting about the Innovations catalog and it. Just because I've just been flipping here through the. The TV magazine, which comes free with the. With the. The sun. And is there a thing on the back a plate? The white trash that must buy this rubbish. I mean, this one. I don't know how you describe that there. Oh, classy, isn't it? Oh, it's a porcelain dollar of a. Of a young woman, looks like Ginger Spice with her hair up in a blue dress. Yeah. It is strictly limited to 9,500. Am I gonna get one? Why did we waste time with the show? Shouldn't I have been calling? Well, look, it says, it says. How much is it? Well, she can be yours for the special half price offer of just £94 50. Is that all? Really? You're not winding me up, Ice D. You're not winding me up because if I look at it, it's 940, because I think it should be. I will go mental because I would love that porcelain piece of shit for 100 quid on my shelf. Hang on a minute, Rick, Let me just read you something. They think it's art, it's classy. I think this blurb will change your mind. Go on then. Okay, well, I'm just. Okay, okay. Her name is quite simply Dearest Rose. I love it. And she's portrayed here holding a beautiful. I mean, of course it's gonna be Dearest Rose, isn't it? Let me read it. Because her name is Bert. Dearest Rose is portrayed here holding a beautiful bouquet of roses given to her by her love. She has gently plucked some of them and placed them in her chestnut hair. She's wearing a gown that's filthy. Oh, she is as well. She's stuffing them on her head. All right, go on. She's wearing a gown of beautiful turquoise silk. Her skirt flows to the floor and from beneath it you can see her dainty shoe just peeping out, decorated with a tiny handmade rose. That is brilliant. That's beautiful, innit? And you can pay £9,45amonth for 10 months and that can be yours. And I think you'll agree it is just beautiful. I mean, the best one I've ever seen. There was one that was a doll, right? Like a really doll, you know, a horrible scary doll. And it was something like, you know, £100 and it said, call your family and tell them it's a girl. And I just imagined this 45 year old woman with bunches and rouge on her hair, still dressed in her ballerina outfit, going, I've had a baby, Mother, you haven't. I have. It's a bloody baby. Why do you hate me? It's a doll. Why do you hate me? I mean, I know what sort of people are they preying on? Well, there's one just had a. A baby. Sorry. The doctor. Call the doctor. Don't call the doctor. I've had a bloody baby. Well, I, I remember seeing one which just was extraordinary. I mean, again, I'm thinking specifically of the people that borrowed it, it was about 3 foot tall. It was I think again made of porcelain or possibly plastic. It was a baby. It was like a sort of. It was like a kind of one year old baby. Like that was the design. Wearing a Harley Davidson biker outfit, the leather cap, the jacket, the nappy. Rather like Marlon Brando did in the wild. Unbelievable. Oh, dear. I mean the scum I saw recently was like flipping through. It was wedding rings. It was a selection of exclusive wedding rings. Imagine giving this. Imagine getting in on one knee and giving your beloved a themed Lord of the ring. Lord of the ring. Wedding ring. Oh, that is brilliant. Will you be my wife? Better still, my troll. Oh dear. The scum that must be that they're preying on, like you say. I mean, unbelievable. It's those sort of houses that I remember going into as a child sometimes and you met a friend from school and he'd go into their house and it was like a shrine. I remember some people kept the polythene on their three piece suite. Yeah. There was someone. You weren't allowed in the front room. Like we couldn't. You couldn't go in the front room. And it's like you look around and there's all these dolls and that and it's just like, oh, God. Scary. What in God's name happens in this house after dark? You know what I mean? But the people who keep the polythene on their sofas, it's like, who are you waiting for? What day are you going to use this? Because I'll tell you this, the Queen's never coming. I know. Tony Blair's not going to pop in covered in grease in dungarees. Exactly. I won't sit down. You can sit down. You can sit down, Tony. I've been waiting for 40 years. Look, I've had a baby. It's not a real baby. It is a baby. Is this door locked? Why do you hate me? Oh, God. Call your friends and tell them it's a girl. So if you're one of the scums that have ever bought anything from one of trash normally you'll get maybe commemorative plates. Commemorate. I'll tell you what, if I ever win the lottery, I'm going to buy all them up. Yeah, I'm going to buy all them up in one foul swoop. That'll be one. I think it was Cliff Richard. It was a commemorative plate of Cliff Richard. It sounded great. It said Cliff never ages. Cliff never ages and neither will this. Really? Did it say that? Tell your friends and tell Me? You've married Cliff Richards. Look, I've married. It's a play. It's not a play. I sleep with it. I've married Cliff Richard. Remember that mental case that was thought she was married to Mike Reed? No, I don't remember that. Now, is this Mike Reed the former DJ or Mike read the the Entertainer strike? Former dj. And it had a shot of her just prancing around in the nude with a feather bur on saying, I'm married to Mike Reed or someone. She was obsessed with him. That's libelous. I mean, is she still looking for a fellow? Yeah. Oh, what would you do? Imagine it was you in a love triangle between me and Louise Woodward. Oh, right. Okay. Would you. And they were. They were fighting over you and I. I think they can both get pretty violent. Yeah. I mean, if, you know, I mean. No, but I mean, I'm not what I do. I do what any gentleman would do in that situation. And I'd let them wrestling, wrestle it out nude in a hotel room. Just, you know, just see how they go. Let's have a record. Sorry to call the lawyers and turn it to girl clocks. Coldplay XFM 104.9. In fact, can I just plug something? Go on. Because you can hear Coldplay live tonight from seven o'clock. The whole Earl's Court gig on XFM from seven. Blimey. Yeah, it's not bad. Yeah. To Coldplay. To Coldplay. Happy Easter. Happy egg. Well. Well, that's about it from us, isn't it? We got. You know, to be honest, I didn't miss Carl at all. I didn't miss Carl. In fact, I felt, I felt we, we worked harder, we did a better show without him. I think he. Well, I think that we should, you know, tell him that we, you know, we don't need him. If he turns up, it's fine. If not, you know what I mean? Yeah. Because that will wind him up. Oh, you know, if you could send. Oh, could you send Carly emails saying to Ricky or Summer, because he gets all those, doesn't he? Or to Carl saying the show was better without Carl. Yeah. Can you please do that for us? We're telling the truth. He'll hear it. He'll come back and hear it. So we know it's a wide wind up, but just. I just want to see his crushed little face. Monday is. If you can send as many emails as possible saying this show was better without Carl, I will be grateful and I promise I'll tell him the truth next week. Do you think I can do that for us? I think so. Is it carl.pilkerton.co.uk yeah, and it's Carl. With a K. Yeah. And send some to me because he'll read those next week as well. Yeah. Ricky Gervais. Xfm.com yeah, send some to me as. Well and just pass them on. Yeah. And to the. To the head of xfm. What's his. What's his one? Yeah, because he won't get in trouble because obviously Andrew's listening, so we know It's a joke. Phillipsfm.com in fact, could you send a. Load manager, Charlotte Susson? Yeah. Andrew Phillips. Just saying it's so much better without Carl because it's got a bit self indulgent. He just does his same old stuff about Auntie Nora farting and it's. It's not big and it's not clever and the man's a fool. So if you do something like that, you know, make stuff up as well. Thanks very much. Much. Happy egg. Happy egg indeed. Can I just end with a tune? Yeah. Ed Harcourt. I don't know if you've listened to his current album. Yeah. But there's some. Some nice treats on there. And this is one called the Birds Will Sing for Us. A nice way to end. See you later. Cheers. Happy Easter. Do the email thing, E.",
