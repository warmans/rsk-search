I'm bored already. Yeah, already bored. Bored already. Every week you start it the same way. Yeah. That was not bad, though. You actually grammatically made sense, which is impressive. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks very much. A rare treat indeed from Digimace. Some of the listeners have already worked out. Got nothing to say at all. Sure. Haven't prepared again. No, we were. We. We did come in half hour early to repair, but instead me and Carl were playing. You had to flick the football into the bin, you had five goes each or the world was going to end. Okay. And that. That took up. That took up a good 25 minutes. Yeah. I liked it when we came back and then we started just trying to beat each other in the corridor. And I beat him. I scored a goal. He was gutted because he thought he fancied himself at football. And I beat him and I was knackered and sweating. Y. And as I walked back to you about five minutes ago, you were looking to the records, you went. And this was lovely. You went well with another preparation, then. Yeah. Like a sarcastic teacher. Yeah, Like a teenager. Like an annoyed teenager whose parents have embarrassed him once again. And you beat Kyle, did you? Yeah. Because you're not. I mean, you're not. I'm not good at football. Well, you're not particularly nimble on your feet. Oh, Carl. No, you're not. Douglas Spado. I'm more nimble. I'm all right, I'm all right. But Carl's sort of. I think it's got more skills than me. But he hasn't got the aggression session and the weight. Yeah, yeah. So I just pushed him aside. Yeah. Good work. Yeah. I'm going on holiday. Are you? Yeah. I'm not here next week. What are you gonna do, Carl? You're gonna do the best of or something next week, aren't you? Yeah, that's what we've got to sort out. Well, I can't sort out. I've literally. I've got to go to the airport. Straight after the show. You've got to do some links. No, I'm not doing any links. I said I wouldn't. So that's what we planned. No, we didn't. I said I'd do some during the show and then you. I thought you were joking. I. I honestly can't do it today, so. We do some during the show. What are you gonna do? Just put the shows that we've done in this year. Sorry, guys, I hate to interrupt. This is the sort of. Should have been discussing when you were playing football. I know. Play what you going to play? Let's have a bit of food Fighters. Let's just discuss this off there. Okay? Foo Fighters there. Learning to fly. Steve. I hope the pilot that I get today flying the plane that I'm going on holiday in has already learned to fly. Well done. That is dynamite. That's. That's a textbook link. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's genius. Very good. Where are you going? What's the story? Where are you off to? Sorrento. Where's that? Sort of South Italy. Italy, yeah. What are you like on holiday? Are you a nightmare? Are you the. Like. Because you're quite. But you're quite. I mean, obviously, you know, I've often said on the radio before that I. I mean, spending any length of time with you is one of the most unbearable things I've ever had to do. I mean, spending a week with you is nightmarish and sharing any kind of accommodation is. Do you know what I mean? No, seriously. I mean, it's like. It's like hell. It's like a living hell. It's like having a teenager. No, just doing. It's like having a teenage kid who can. Can't be entertained by anything. Just chill out. Just chill out, dude. Just. Max, relax. Yeah, Max, relax. Sure, sure. Do you. And so if you're in somewhere like Italy, like, somewhere like that. Because obviously very beautiful city and very cultured and stuff, is that something you enjoy? Do you enjoy the culture of that? The beautiful architecture? Let's say a hotel's the same anywhere as long as there's room service and a nice room in porn. It's nice weather. Sure. If it's not, I'm annoyed. Yeah. And I need to blame someone. And is it true that you go because you go to Italy most years, don't you? Is that because that's the only food you like? I like. I like pasta and pizza. Yeah. Yeah. And I've been to other places. I went to France once and that you can't explain to them to cook it. Prop. Just cook it properly. I don't want any to cook it. There's blood in the middle of that. Yeah, sure, sure. Hungary. There was. It was just. Oh, I went there for a while and I didn't know. I couldn't identify the animals. They were killing for me. Yeah. So And I know quite a lot about natural history and I couldn't identify what was on the plate, so I don't. For a couple of days. No, I just got annoyed and I went to McDonald' yeah, well, that's the. Great thing about McDonald's is they are in exactly major cities. No, but you can't go wrong with. So if I was with you on holiday and I, you know, and we were. We were hanging out, whatever, and I took you to say, maybe a beautiful cathedral. Is that something you'd enjoy? I can't quite imagine you actually taking the time to. Well, as long as. As long as it's not a very long walk. We'd have to stay there more than a couple of minutes. I'd love to look around. Right, so you would. You'd look at the cathedral? Yeah, that's taken, you know, that takes people breath, you know, takes people's breath away. You know, people travel from around the world to see that. You would. And how long would you stay around. The world to see it? I think they go somewhere and they go, well, they might as well look at. They're huge. Yeah. Would you. And would you. Would you sort of spend any time looking at that? Would you just sort of soak in the atmosphere for a moment or would you. I'd look at it and I'd go, that's brilliant. And then if there was any sort of soaking in. I can do that later when there's nothing to look at. Right. What, you just to do your memory of it later when you're in the bar. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And would you. So can. Can you be kind of in awe of something like that? If it's big. Okay. If I go in the casino and it's. And it's. I've seen bigger. I go, oh, I've seen bigger. If it's the biggest I've seen, I go, that is huge. Yeah, let's go. Yeah, sure. Because you are. You're a sort of man who gets bored. And this is true, Carl, you may not be the flu. Ricky Gervais is a man who gets bored drinking a glass of water. It's boring because it's not flavorsome enough. No, it's absolute boring. The only thing Jane's got me onto, fizzy water, which at least got something there. But I only drink that when I'm sort of dehydrated in the middle of the night. I never. There's no. I never drink a drink of water. No, it is boring. Yeah. Yeah, but that's why you've always got headaches and you're always apparently moaning and stuff. Yeah, yeah. That's another one of the reasons I hate you. But when I, when I say hate you, I don't mean I hate you. I didn't mean, I didn't mean to blur it out that strongly. What I mean is if I'm spending a lot of time with you, that's. Why he said we're in the BBC canteen. And I was sort of like. And he just put his knife on. I said, I'm never eating with you again. I said, what's the matter? I said, you annoy me. You. I hate eating with you. It annoys me. You've got it look like a child food. It's just. You eat chips and sausage and rubbish. You don't eat. Look at you don't touch your vegetables. You don't drink water. He said you, I, he really got. Because you, you've got this like this hatred of anything that's good for you. You won't eat any form of salad. You just. Why do I eat salad? Because it's good for you. Lettuce is boring. Lettuce is absolutely boring. Cucumber are boring. But, but, yeah, but the thing is, you see, I admit that lettuce and cucumber have not got much flavor, but that's why people will add, say, look, in Italy they'll add a lovely dressing, maybe some olive oil, maybe some balsamic vinegar. Well, even by yourself. Because the good thing about a nice mature lump of cheddar cheese is you don't have to have any dressing. Although you add some anyway. I put a little bit of olive oil, maybe some on a Ritz cracker. You don't need it, it's just extra. Sure, sure. Well, good luck. I noticed you're wearing the. Is this your traveling gear? You've got the sweatpants and the T shirt. The free T shirt. Yeah. Looking to get an upgrade, are you? Or. I'm going first class. Sure. Badly drawn boy spitting in the wind on XFM 104.9. Are you going to be taking in any of the culture in Italy? Is that something you do? Yeah. The opera. Don't know about the opera. I've never been to the opera. I do like, you know. You like? Yeah. Not. I wouldn't sit through a whole one, but I mean, I like. I like the songs they take for it for that World cup one. And those two fat birds that they sung in Shawshank Redemption was good. Yes. But I think. Yeah, you know, I Haven't got into it extensively. I haven't studied the art. The art of opera. Also, it's in foreign, so you don't really know what's happening. It's in foreign. Yeah. So you don't. That's annoying for you. Yeah. What about. Are you. Are you a fan of any of the great English opera operas, like the Pirates of Penzance? Yeah. Gilbert and Sullivan. To me, Gilbert and Sullivan were like the. Probably their. Their day equivalent of like Richard still go getting together with Tony SLATTERY and then 100 years later, people go, it's brilliant. It is. Like, they might as well, I don't know, make any. Any episode of Whose Line Is It Anyway? Right, yeah. Into an opera. And in 200 years time we're going, that's genius. Yeah. Listen to this one, look. This is party quirks. Yeah. Am Dram society staging world worst step. Because I was. When I was in the Pirates of Penzance once in an amateur production you. Used to like whose lines. Anyway, I did. That was. Although I did watch it when it first came on Channel 4, about 15, 20 years ago. But we. We did the Pirates of Venzance when I was in a narrative dramatic society in Bristol. The Bristol Operatic Society Light Operatic Society. I don't know why I was involved, because I can't sing. My audition. This is how desperate they were for blokes, I swear to God, right? I can't sing, you know. Yeah, all right, calm down. And I. I went in and they said, so, what are you gonna sing? I went, well, I just. I don't. I want to surprise you. They said, do you want a piano accompaniment? I said, no, I don't think so. I went to the back. I swear to God, I went to the back of the room and I just sang Thumbelina. Thumbelina Tiny little thing, Thumbelina Dance Thumbelina, sing Thumbelina what's the difference if you're very small? Cause when your heart is full of love you're six feet tall. I just did that. And they just looked at me like I was the weirdest freak they'd ever had. Immediately put me in the chorus because that was how desperate they were from blokes. We staged. We rehearsed it. I couldn't remember the lyrics. Thank God you were doing Thumbelina. Yeah, yeah. I couldn't. I couldn't remember the lyrics. What was it for? It. Was it Gilbert and Sullivan? It was. It was the Pirates of Penzance. There weren't enough blokes, right, so that we had to double up. So some of the pirates had to double up as the policemen who are chasing the pirates. Little bit problematic in the scene when the policeman and the pirates have a fight. That was a little bit tricky. And the worst things. There's this sequence where like these sort of the daughters of the major general all kind of. Oh, beautiful. Something like, you know. Oh, beautiful little girls are weed. And the women they had, they must have all been over 40. I mean real kind of Toothless Crohn's creeping around in their 90s. Is it the sort of women that buy one of those sort of porcelain dolls? Look, I've had a baby. It's not a real. It is a real baby. I'm gonna stab you. Yeah, one of those. Exactly. It's the sort of women that you' see maybe on TV's Bargain Hunt. You know the kind of contestants you get on there. Those women who sort of very nam dram and they think they've clung on to their looks but they'd have never made it in. In the guy who was playing the. There's a guy who. Supposed to be an 18 year old prince. An 18 year old pirate. The pirate king. He must have been 40. It was a day. He also directed the show though. So he got to prance around in these thigh high boots. Ludicrous. It was so embarrassing. It was shameful. Really. I'd love to go to Amdram is. A whole other world. It's just. It's such an incredible place because there's so much backbiting and envy and really. Oh, it's incredible. It's worse than the real world of theater and tv. It's unbelievable because the same old people get to do it every year because they can hold a note. Can we go along? You would absolutely adore it. Javace it is film it Secret. Have you ever done the. In a play Pilk. We know this. Carl. You've. You've performed the. The talent show. Didn't I? Yeah. Oh, the talent show. Yeah. Remind us of the talent show. That's when I did walk like an Egyptian dressed up as a woman. Yeah. Yeah. And did me magic trick. Oh, that's that. Is it an egg? The egg one? Yeah. What was the egg one again? When I actually I've ruined it now saying the egg one. But I went on stage with like an anki. Yeah. And I said at this point I was dressed up as a caretaker in it. Sure. Don't know why. I can't remember. No. I stood there with this with this Anki over me. And yeah, I said, right, you're gonna love this one. Yeah. I said, I'm gonna make a bird appear in front of you from ear eyes, right? And I'm like, oh, God, it's gonna do. So I'm stood there. Yeah, I'm sure I did. Pulled the anky off. It was an egg. Had an egg and said, oh, it hasn't been born yet. That's brilliant. They loved it. Yeah. Yeah. Wild for it today. Round of applause. Yeah. How old were you? Was that you, like, 17? Was that. Apart from the. Apart from your paper round, was that the high point of your life so far? Is that the best? I'd like to see you take that on the road or maybe at least up to the Edinburgh Festival next year. Go. We're gonna play a song now, right? One of my great track. Watch that man off. One of my favorite albums. A lot Insane by David Bowie. But during that. Can. Can you. Can you think of a couple of things for me? What's the best thing that's ever happened to you? Can you. Can you think about that for three minutes? Me and Steven leave you alone. Just the best thing that's ever happened to you. Remembering thinking, that is amazing. Yeah. Can you do that? Play the. Watch that man, David Bowie. Steve's caught unaware there. Just wandering around. Not quite ready, were you? Well, no, I'm just relaxing. I'm just laying back, just hanging. Yeah. Carl. Yeah. Best thing that's ever happened to you. Best event, best day in your life. I mean, there's loads of things that happen, like. Yeah, no, but, you know, I mean, you can go for obvious stuff like, you know, meeting Suzanne. Yeah. Take that. Take that as red. Yeah. Yeah. You've got that on your desert and that's already done well. And the day you, you know, you got your qualifications through. Yeah, the history. Probably. I mean, when you asked me, then the first thing that came into my mind, right, that was a real surprise, right? Because it's like you get surprises on your birthday and that, don't you? But they're not really surprises because you're hassling your mom and dad for stuff. Yeah. And then they, you know, they might buy at you. So it's not really a real surprise, is it? You know what I mean? Yeah. So I'd say something that was really like, oh, yeah, nice one. I've got some. Here is the time when my dad said, empty the bin, will you? Right? I said, oh, do I have to? And I was watching something, it was like why don't you? Or something like that on the telly. Is this what started your tea bag and banana skin collection? Right. So it was like, you know in the summer holidays where you'd have dead good telly in the morning, you had like the monkeys. Yeah, yeah. Banana splits and all that. Right. And I was like, loving that. I was watching that. I mean, I said, empty the bin. I said, oh, the monkeys are on in a minute. Just empty the bin. So I emptied it and I just put it near the door. He said, don't leave it there. He said, stick it near the bins in the garden. I thought, I'll put it there later. So now. Do it now. Yeah, Right. So I was like, if I missed the beginning of this, I'll be livid. Right. So I picked it up quick, ran out down to the bottom of the garden, slung it in the corner and sort of went to turn back, to go back in and had to look again because they had, like, a little AA truck they bought me. It wasn't brand new, but it got it from somewhere. A little AA go kart. You know, one of them, like, little things. I mean, I was. I was young. Yeah, right. Yeah. And it was like, Go kart. What kind of. No, the plastic ones. Yeah. When you're about. I don't know, I must have been like five or six or something. So I don't quite follow that out there. My dad sent me out with a bin bag, so I could see, right, what he got me. And it wasn't my birthday or anything, he just got it from somewhere. You sure you hadn't just nicked it and dumped it out the bank? Possibly, sure. But that was like a genuine, like. Oh, yeah. Smart. Yeah. So I went back in, watched the telly. Did I tell you about my go kart? Yeah. Like you. Yeah. About your dad giving it away. Yeah. What's the story? I've told you something. Have you gone What? Said it again. Well, have I told it on air? I can't remember. Maybe I just told you it. When I was about 8 or 9, I had a go kart and I loved it. It's one of those. So you pressed back and forth? Yes. And I used to come in every day, used to just get changed, run out, and it was behind the shed and I used to just go up and down the garden. And one day I came running in and I ran out and I couldn't see it and I went to the back door, my mum was washing up and I went, where's my Go kart. She went, your dad swapped it. Your dad swapped it? Yeah. With this. It was mate Jimmy in the pub. He went. It's just. I said, what? Yeah, he swapped it for a wheelbarrow. So I went and looked back and there was this wheelbarrow, right. That obviously just came off a building site. Yeah. Covered in concrete. I couldn't. It was steel. Like, I could hardly move it. Yeah. And I'm back. And I went, really? She went, yeah, it's your wheelbarrow. See, I'm thinking my dad lost the wheelbarrow that day. Yeah. And I used to. I used to push that up and down. It wasn't the same. And then. Push the wheelbarrow. Yeah. Anything in there or. No, I just, like. So I was just trying to sort of keep myself amused. But anyway, that summer I went on holiday and I went to Bogner with my mum and my nan. Another wild holiday. Yeah. Yeah. And I was sort of out one. Okay. And I made friends with this. This kid and he'd hired a go kart from the caravan. So. Right. And I remember him going around it, and I was. It was great. And I said. And I said, I've got a go kart. And the caravan window opened and my mum said, don't lie. You've got a wheelbarrow. Be truthful. I went. I had to go kart. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's so tragic. Yeah. Did you ever really forgive him for that? I'd never forgive him, my dad, if he'd swapped a go kart for a wheelbarrow. I just thought, that's part of the course. Yeah. You know, I mean. Yeah, they're in charge. Sure. Did you used to rush home, change and into that sort of gardener's gear, straight into your hard hat. Dungarees. Okay, Mum. Any bricks need moving? Exactly. Yeah. Oh. Oh, that's so tragic. Yeah. Yeah. Still, that was your happiest day. Yeah. Beautiful cars. That's the one that sprung to mind. Yeah. Yeah. My unhappiest. You see how go karts can be good or bad? Does that make you think, Carl, that the go kart is. You know, it's good and evil. Play a record. I'm upset. Huh? Oh, really? What ads have you got? I've got these. Electric Soft Parade. Same way every day on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais with him. Steve Merchant. Rick. I am. I only had one thing I had to do all week because I only had. I was. All week. I was so excited about getting up Friday Morning phoning, getting Bruce Springsteen tickets. The Boss is playing in October and basically got up too late. Well, I've not sold out already. It had sold out, but I've started calling about 12:30. It sold out. I trolled the net. I trolled. Yeah. Some of those buys are bulk buys for selling on, aren't they? They're not all individuals. This is the problem. I mean, I don't know how many people they can fit in Wembley arena, but sold out by 12:30 and that's popular. Wembley arena, yeah. It's about 12,000. It. I was so gutted. It was all I had to do. I was so looking forward to it. I phoned up one of those, like, quite dodgy ticket agencies. Do you know how much he was offering to. You know, they're like. They're 45 quid to buy. He said the starting price is 225 quid. I mean, that to me is like a ticket to, like a legal ticket. I don't know. It's crazy. I was so. They'd have to say their booking fee was £150. Exactly. So I. But now I'm just. I'm like desperate. I don't know what to do. I'm just wondering if I can abuse our position on the radio and just try and scrounge them from anyone who's listening. I mean, anyone who's listening, who's got the power to get them, you know, or. Begging, isn't it? It's exactly what it is, Rick. Yeah. Yeah. I was gonna try and dress it up. Yeah. It's just begging. I just get touts after you as well. Exactly. Dissing him. Ricky.gervais. shut up. Ricky.gervais fm.co.uk if there's anything you can do to get me a ticket, I'm willing to pay for it. Up to the point. 45 quid? Yeah. Wow. You don't want to throw your money around. 25 quid. Don't you know who I am? Yeah, but. But that. I mean, do you know what I mean? Because I'm just like. I asked Carl if he could sort it out. He's done nothing. He's achieved nothing. I know. So I'm just desperate. I'm in a desperate situation and I don't quite know what to do. I'll tell you this, though, Carl. Don't bother doing favors for him because he's not grateful. You give himself. And he goes, right, does this mean I have to give you something back? And I go, well, no. He goes, Good. I got you Cure tickets and you did nothing. Yeah, you go, it was rubbish. I went along to that gig. It was a balmy summer's night. The Cure, as far as I'm concerned, owe me a balmy summer's night because I wasted it. Hour and a half they played for. They played four hits. I don't want to hear their dirge from, like, some dodgy album from, like, 1984. I'm not interested. Play the hits. Boys Don't Cry, Love, Cats, blah, blah, blah, blah. Instead, I got nothing. I was so angry. I was. I was just. Oh, man. You're probably angry at Carl, weren't you? I was angry at Carl for wasting my time getting me the tickets. I paid for it. To see what sort of a bloke Steve Merchant is. No, it's not the point. Do you not agree, though? If you're going to go and see a band like the Cure on a summer's night. Yeah. Hyde park, you do not want to hear some obscure B sides and album track. But that's what that was a great thing about. When. When I saw Bowie at the BBC, he played. He played. You know about that. I don't know about this. Yeah, you do. What? When did you see about it? At the Jonathan Ross recording. Oh, what, your show Beats friend Jonathan Ross? Yeah. What was this. Was that that TV thing he did? Yeah. You went to that. You haven't told me about this. Yes, I have. No, you haven't. But you were away, I think. No, I wasn't, because I watched it on tv. It was amazing. Well, don't tell me that. It was incredible. Were you seriously there? Yeah. And then. Then I went onto a show on the Saturday. Did you? Yeah, because I was just about. John said, oh, I need someone to come in. Yeah. And I went onto the radio. So you were hanging out with Bowie. Yeah, go on. Who else was there? Well, the weird thing was, I go. Through my favorite artists and you just name them and see if they were there. Just let me know. No, but it was amazing, right, because he started. He played just doing local because it was. That. It was a meltdown thing. And he did be my wife, which was great. Then he started doing Fame, right. And they've been talking about Ziggy in the. The interview. He was going, oh, everyone goes on Ziggy. Will you just stop it? Right. It sort of like got to a point where it's going all. And it was really funny and. But Jonathan's like a favorite phase. And then he started playing Fame and It was really good. And he just went, stop this, stop this. This isn't this. Let's do Ziggy. And my spine tingled. I was worried. I did take his Dallas and I'll tell you what, it sounded like the album version. And he's got an amazing man. And it was. And I love it when they do that. They know. I hate it when they've. Just because they've been going for 25 years, they start changing. Sorry. I can't believe that you went to this, that you knew you were going to this. And you never asked me, you never asked Jonathan if you could get me in. I mean, seriously, I. I mean, you know how much that would have meant. Yeah, it was very tight, apparently. I. I know, but it was very, very. It was very sort of. Apparently Richard Branson couldn't get in as a queue, so I was like, especially. It was. There was me. Me and Jane went. David Badil and Frank Skinner. Oh, what, some new showbiz friends of yours? No, I mean, I'm rubbing it in, Steve. I can't. I'm just. But you might not have liked it. You might have complained, like Carl Cure. And you. You turned it back on. Rubbish, though. That was rubbish. Well, you might not like what David did. You know, I'll tell you this, seriously. If I find out that you do, that you've gone to some secret gig or something in the future and I find out you've been. Seriously, that's it. There's no more office, there's no more. No, I'm not joking. I'm not around. Because that, to me is like. Like, that's what friendship is. That's like a textbook example of friendship. What do you think, Carl? No, I just think that's really awesome. I wasn't awake. Don't try and fool me. Yeah. I wouldn't have been away if I was away. I would have been away. That was happening. You were asleep. I'm. I'm. Seriously, I'm. You could. We can joke about it, but I'm really angry about this. What do you think, Carl? There's a secret, right? There's this. Apparently there's a secret Bruce Springsteen gig that's been planned. Okay. Are you. I. If you. Seriously, if you. But seriously, if you. If I find out you're at that, I will. I mean. Oh, dear. Play a record so I can shout expletives. Oh, I tell you what. Lovely bit of electronic. Oh. Just to calm and soothe me. I'm just. Seriously, I'm not joking. That really Winds me up. That really winds me up. The Cure was good. Electronic Getting away with it. Nice to hear that again, Rick. Yeah, lovely level that, level that. Someone's just. You've had a bit of result on you. Well, no, there's a guy who's phoned up who said he might be able to sort me out with the Springsteen ticket. So deeply excited about that. But, you know, people don't, don't, don't care for Complacen. He might not be able. Steve demands a lot of hard work. Well, he might not be able to sort it out. You know, he's going to make some calls, but if he can't, then, you know, keep calling or emailing Ricky Dochev. You'll be taking me, won't you? Because after that rant about me not taking you, well, you're welcome to go. I mean, if. Well, if you told me that before, I probably could have blanks. I'm using your name. If you let me do that, I could have phoned up the promoter, Ricky Gervais B. He'd probably sort me right up. But, yeah, no, I mean, you know, we. Joking aside, it is quite serious. And. And as I said, I don't. I don't want to pay for the nose for him. You know, I'm willing to go up to sort of 47 pounds like that. That Steve, trying to impress a girl in a queue, offered the bounce of two quid for himself if he could go to the front. Oh, man, that was so embarrassing. I tried to bribe. I told you that car. I tried to bribe the bouncer. He was coming out. He was just. They thought he was really. He thought he was in total. He was. He was like the. The bouncer of the Met Club, the Met Bar or something. Tenor in. He was choosing. No, he wasn't. He was picking people off, right? That was it. He was picking people off and he was going, you. You can come in. You can come in. I got trained to a couple of girls. I thought, I'm in here, I'm sorry, dear. And I thought, I'll act flash. I'll try and bribe my way into the club. The guy was walking past. I cornered him. I went, how much did he go in? He said, fiver. I went, I'll give you 7, 2 power. Because the problem I had was I didn't want to go straight to like a tenner because if he accepted 7, I didn't want to be that, you. Know, I didn't want to waste. I thought we could at least haggle. It was the term. Is that frugal? What is the term for that? Thrifty. I know. No, but I'm resenting this because you are trying to create this kind of. This lies, this myth that I'm somehow, you know, like that I'm somehow cheating my money or that I'm not a great lover. You know what I mean? And that's. It's annoying me, frankly. Oh, dear. Carl, you went to Habitat this week, didn't you? You're not going to believe this, Steve. Go on. He told me. No. Do you know how I tell you about those. Those lads at school with big heads? Sure, yeah. The big head lads. Yeah, right. And the web feet. Yeah. Web dance. Web dance was it? They weren't there, were they? They weren't there. But you know, like Ricky was always saying, oh, they don't exist. They only went to your school, you know, was in Habitat. There was only one. One sat on a sofa. Not one of the lads, but one of the. A big headed lad. Is that like. Is he like Frank Sidebottom? Big head. I mean, is it like. Well, I don't know what it. This is. Why? You know, it'd be nice. You think it's maybe a medical. Well, it'd be nice if there's a doctor listening. Sure. Yeah. Yeah, a doctor. Listen to X. I'm thinking I must phone up and fuel Carl's obsession with the deformed. Yeah, nobody's not really deformed as big. As the head, probably. You see, it's weird how it's always kids who will see with it. So I'm wondering whether they grow into size head. Right. And then the. When they get older it works out all right. Like jumpers my mum used to get me, but jumpers a size too big, so it'd last a year. So I'm just wondering if it's the same. So how old are these, Jenny? Generally they're not like adults, they're like kids. Well, when I was at school there, I was probably about seven and this kid. Do they have to wear any kind of apparatus to sort of keep their head from kind of, you know, not tipping them over or sort of staying up? Well, I'm just worried that the head's kind of too heavy for their body or something in there. No, I mean it's not that big. Right. It's. It's just not right. You kind of go. You sort of do a bit of a double take. Yeah, yeah. Like the fringe isn't sort of, you know, just above their Eyes. It's quite high up. Sure. That sickens you. Obviously. And is this something that repulses you slightly? Do you get. No, no, no, that's. That'd be cruel. No, sure. Yeah. But you know, it's not cool to. Discuss it on the radio. Well, it happens, shouldn't it? You know what I mean? Yeah. So. And I'd just like to know what it is. If it's like a. Like a water on the head type thing. Like water on the knee. Yeah, but on the head. On the head. But yeah. If anyone knows what it is. Yeah. People with big heads. Yeah, the. And it's. Yeah, okay. It'd be good. Good information. So what time. How are we doing? You sure he wasn't sort of. Sort of leaning forward? And he was really tall. So the top of his. The head looked quite big. But then it went to a little body. But really his body was a lot further away. No big head? Yeah, just a big head. Rest of his body, fine. Face okay. Everything's normal. You were looking at him in a kettle. If you wore a hat it'd be all right. But what do you mean if he wore a hat he'd be all right? You'd probably just think, oh, it's a big hat. Yeah. So you look like a 10 gallon hat. Yeah. That would go down onto his shoulders with two eyes cut in it. Yeah. Like something the Ant Hill Mob. Yeah. Michael Benteen's potty time. Yeah. How would a hat help him? Yeah. Are you sure this wasn't a diddy man? I'm not being mean. I just want to know what it is. No though. Okay. But if you are a doctor listening and you, you know, you want to use your kind of free sadness. Not the doctor who phoned the bloke in America and said, where do I get blood from? Sure. Not that doctor because I assume he's been struck off now given. Give us a call and sort out the. The whole big head conundrum. What's the number? 087-008-001234. It's also the number to call if you have Bruce Springsteen tickets available. I would pay up to 47. Don't do it. Go yourself. Don't give them to Steve for cost price. Make a little profit. I'll come. We don't. You know what? I feel you've already ruined the thing. Don't ruin some more of my dreams. But I'll tell you what. If you do get Steve a ticket so you'll be so grateful that he will Spend a bit of money on you. I imagine you'll buy tickets and, you know, give him something pretty special because you're earning now and, you know. Yeah. So let me discuss that with them. I mean, let's not make any promises. So. Yeah. You're in the middle of a phone call there, aren't you? Is that still. Is that poor bloke still on the line? Probably not, no. He's gone. Oh, was he? Yeah, in the middle of summer. White stripes, though. Yeah. Dead leaves and the dirty ground. Steve, what are you doing? Sorry, mate, I'm just preoccupied with other stuff. I've got the whole Springsteen thing I'm worried about. I've got that playing on my mind. I've never seen Steve so worried. Like, usually he just. He sits there with his head. Rick, I've made promises to people I can't keep, I promise. About three different people. I'm getting them tickets. Well, it serves you right. I can't believe it. I cannot believe it. It. Are we doing the game in this hour or what? Oh, we could do. Should we do that? Your game? What was that thing you told me the other day as well, of talking about it? People have been phoning up about this. I don't think we should talk about conditions of the mind and brain. Well, that woman's put you right. Yeah. Shown us it's a hydrocephalus. It could be. And all it is is that it's. It's totally curable and normal life. What they do is it's a baby born with sort of water on the brain and it comes out. Must hurt a bit in childbirth. And then they just drain it off. It's just full of water. I tell you what. What. Just reminded me, but weird stuff going on. It wasn't a baby, was it? This was a. Maybe it was a baby. Maybe it was. Oh, maybe it was a baby, but it had water on the. Everything. Well, listen, right, this was a kid with a big ad. As far as I'm concerned, he wasn't a baby. But we know what he's got. Everything's sorted. But other things, right, that are weird in the world. Yeah. You know, you're always like, yeah, you're going on about there's no ghosts and stuff. Stuff. Yeah. Right. Add you on to this one, yeah. Someone here who I work with, right, I'm not going to say they are because it doesn't matter, but they were eating space cake, right? What do you mean by that, Carl? Explain. What's the space cake for? People who. It's somebody. Some sort of druggie cake, isn't it? Yeah, Right. A dope brownie or whatever. Yeah. So. So with cannabis in it, is that what you're saying? I think it's something stronger than that, isn't it? I don't know. But anyway, he was having this space cake and. You better give me the name now, Carl, because I've got a reporting. No, listen. No, no, no, no. Is it Sturgis? Was it Claire Sturges? Yes. He's gone on the hardest decision. Doesn't do anything to it. So listen, right, so he's at a party, right, with his mates and they're listening to the Star Sailor album, right? Right. And sat there and he's had some of this cake, right, and he's listening to the album and his mate sat across the way talking to someone else. Right? That's weird. The album's on and he thinks to himself, this track's going on a bit. Yeah. And his mate across the way, who's talking to someone else, heard him say it. Heard him say it. And he goes, yeah. Goes, yeah, isn't it? Yeah. So he goes, oh, right. And he goes, see, usually at this. Point I say this bloke taking drugs. But you started the story. Yeah. With this bloke. No, no, no, no. Had done some drugs, right, Rick? No, if he. If he was here now. Yeah. He would say, yeah, I know. I think it sounds. I know it sounds mental. Yeah. But it happened. And it wasn't just the one question. It wasn't just like, oh, this track's a bit long in it. Yeah, it is. He had a whole conversation with the guy. Sorry, I just want to clarify. You mean he had the whole conversation telepathically? Yeah. Right. He didn't just shout across. And they've recently met up and, like, they sat there and tried to, like, work out what happened. And without that, they didn't have to talk at all anymore. Yeah. Why did they meet up? Couldn't they have just done their own homes? Do they have to have that cake before they start having a conversation? Hold on. Wait a minute, lads. Why are we using our lips? Yeah, Using way too many foot. I'll take. There you go. My only question with that is being skeptics like Ricky and I, whenever we hear a story like that about the paranormal, the first thing we always look for is maybe some. Maybe some other explanation. Yeah. Maybe one vague. Lying. Could be lying. Chinese whisper. I think you pointed out there are drugs an issue. Madness. Yeah. Fear, delusion, sleep, you know, There are. There are so many things you go through. I'm gonna go with the drugs before. Your dead grandmother pops into the equation with the acid. Right. Tell the other story that you totally. You totally believe this as a true story, don't you? The fellow with the. Being killed. Right. Do you know how the other week we were talking about some fella who had his head cut off and he said, when my head goes into. Into the basket, I'm gonna blink a lot, see how many times I can blink. But if you remember when Carl first told me that it was. I think it was Simon or Nick that I pointed out because. No, that's not quite right, Carl. Carl told me it. That he had his head cut off. And when his head was in the basket, it looked up and said, count how many times I blinked. But he believed that as well. Yeah. So he was happy. He was happy with that. Sure. Do you know what I mean? So. So, yeah, you got that. A couple of weeks ago, there was a guy, he had his head cut off. And before he had it off, he'd said, I'm gonna blink to show that there's life after death. He did 32 blinks, right. So you two were sort of putting that down the other way. So I looked again on the Internet at some other website. Yeah, and there's a. So it's a website. Just to clarify, the website is the place where you bought that property on the moon, didn't you? Because it was a bargain, right? So this guy. Fingersumped. Look, we'll see who's been because umped. When. When this world ends, I've got somewhere to go, right? And I know you'll be calling me up saying, oh, can I come with you? You're gonna have to stand deadly still on the moon in your two square foot. I've got about 28 places. It's all. It's all those people with big heads and web feet. They've been buying it all these years. Well, listen, right, go on anyway, play a record. Tell us a story after it. We've been chatting for. Sorry, Carl. No, let's play around. We'll come back with this. What's this, Another ghost story? Let's play my. One of my favorite songs of all time because I'm going on holiday and getting into a lovely serene move. Serene Sorrento is probably from that. It's Neil Young after the Gold Rush. Beautiful. Still to come, that competition as well. Look forward to that. Carl's quiz. Yeah. What an amazing track. Neil Young, Dynamite. After the Gold rush. So go on, Carl. Sorry. Go on, Carl. Just take us back a few steps. Carl, What's. What's the story? Right, so I did some research. Right, let's just recap again. The guy. There was a guy you read about who had his head chopped off. He was guillotined. He had said to the people around him, I'm going to blink once I've had my head cut off. So the brain can still. Or the brain can continue to work out. Yeah, okay. So, yeah, we queried that. So you weren't having any of it? Well, no, possibly for a few seconds till the oxygen stops being fed to the cells because the blood has drained away, but, you know, nothing spectacular. So along the similar sort of lines, right, this is quite a few years ago, this fella sort of upset the Royal Family doing something, right? So they said that this isn't good. It was a ben. Out into that jubilee thing, was it? I can't remember what it was. And they said, right, that was terrible. We're gonna. We're gonna cut your head off. You know, you gotta. You gotta show people that you can't be doing what you've been doing. What Was this, the 1970s? When you say a couple years ago, you mean maybe sort of. Was it the olden days when the phones weren't very good? Ages ago. Yeah, ages ago, Sean. So, yeah, fair enough. Yeah. So very philosophical. Yeah. Imagine that when you were near as good. This was literally ages ago. Yeah, exactly, yeah. Simon Sharma's History of Britain. Yeah, yeah. And even before that, which is Yonks before, when it was all mental and different. Sorry, Carl, go on. So he's having his head cough and he's. But he's resigned to it. It's the day before. He's kind of got it into his head now that I'm not gonna have my head much longer. Sure. So he said, let's. Let's make use of this. Yeah. He said, I wonder how long, like, the body can stay alive without the head on it. Right. So they were like, oh, I don't know. So Hoover. So the jailers, whoever he was, these. Jailers with one eye. Yeah, yeah. Get out. So he said, no, wait a minute. I've got an interesting scientific experiment. Jailer. Well, fair enough. What is it? So he said, what I want to do, right? He said, you know, surely it's my last. Right. You know, I'm gonna be. I'm gonna be dead tomorrow. Sure. So let's do it. Didn't draw it out this long. Did it? Yeah. He said, let's, let's. Let's test this out, you know. He said, do us a favor. He said, you know, it's me last day. What I want you to do is you're gonna cut me head off. Let's put a white line on the floor, right, and see if, you know. Because there's no point asking how far he can sort of walk without an ad if there isn't a line, because you don't know what to count. Do you know? I mean, if it's just. If he loses his head and he's running around all over the place, you can't really count. That's not impressive enough. Yeah. So. So they said, let's make a white line. Sure. Yeah. Who sent this? He did. All they did. I think they started to join in with him and saying, well, let's make this a. Sure, you get it. Go on. So they got Norris McWhirter, the Guinness people. Oh, yeah. So they said, let's get this white line. Yeah. Dedication's all you need. Well, we'll do this. We'll do this tomorrow. He said, all right, I'll see you in the morning. I'll see you in the morning. Night, night. Sleep tight. Bye. Bye. I love the fact that Carl knows exactly what was said. He doesn't know the story or what order is it or when he was exactly what. But he knows the intricacies. All right, then. See you in the morning. Bye. Little kissy, kissy, kissy. Oh, I'm not like that. Oh, you joker. Don't let the bedbugs work. Yeah. Anyway, so he gets up. Do you want to pay for tomorrow? No, I'm all right. Go on. He gets up and they say, right, you know, today's the day and night. And he said, well, you know, I've got. Got used to the idea. So here's a white line for you. Got used to the idea. Go on. So. So they go, right, you ready then? And he said, I go on. And they cut his head off. And the body walked 32 steps without a head. Wow. 32 steps. Incredible. And that's. That's. That's the lesson, really. Did it get as far as the. It walked along the white line. Did it? Yeah, it stayed along the white line, did 32 steps, and then started to stumble a bit and it just fell over. But, you know, it was a test that your body can still keep alive for a little bit. Yeah. When. When you've lost your absolute twaddle. Absolute twaddle. What do you reckon you can do then without an ed. How many stuff. There'd be muscular spasm. Right. It would twitch a bit. Yeah. You could not distinctly take 32 steps. The body. Well, don't. Yeah. It's the doctor to sit on the line. The fellow that bought six parrots. Yeah. And you know, incredible at 32 steps. Right. So you're heading down, doing a bit of line dance. Right. You don't believe that. But something that you do believe that a cockroach can live a week without an ad. It can. Slightly different. Slightly different kind of fish there. Why wow. Insect to human is. Is what I'm thinking. Yeah. That difference. There's not that much difference in coming to. Do you know that a snake has a heart and lungs and kidneys and stuff? Go on. No. Well, I'm just saying. So you're making out as if like they're a totally different like species. I am, I am making that. I mean, call me old fashioned, you. Know what you're talking about. I don't want you embarrassing yourself. Yeah. I am suggesting they're totally different beings. Yeah. That is. Yeah. Now Carl, the, the cockroach is, is a very different thing. The interesting there is that it lives, it lives by his head because a lot of it's on. There's. Some of them are phototropic chemotropic. Some of them just literally have, have irritation and muscle memory. I mean they do have a central nervous system, but it's, it's three different. So if you lose the head, it bypassed a lot of that. Anyway, all this is running around. The reason it dies is because it can't take on water. But it's very different to a man. Right. Having consciousness and then losing that. And the body's still going. No, I remember, I think I remember what I was gonna do here. Yeah. So I'm Gonna carefully walk 32 steps along this white line. I might just go looking out going. Missed a bit. Maybe the head was in the corner going left. Yeah. Left, yeah. Oh, he's not. Well, let's just put it out. I mean if, if anyone listening has maybe had a relative beheaded, maybe in a horrendous car accident, but they got up, maybe they went for a walk. They, you know, they, they had a little chat. Get in touch. Carl, you. You are my favorite being. You are my favorite species. Now you, Carl, may not be particularly different genetically from a cockroach. Do that. Why you have a maiden. When. Let's play a record. You know what? When I told him this fact I send him little facts on text messages just to inflame his, you know, interest. I just sent him, a cockroach can live nine days without his head. He texted back, what's the point of that? Yeah, what's the point? They're not doing experiments, these cockroaches. It's a boring last week to have. And he went. And I'm talking more like you're thirsty. So it's the worst week of your life, isn't it? That week without your head. Head play. Record player. Record competition time. Next. Oh, look at his little face. Look at his. If you've not heard car's competition, he. Could do without an ed. Closet. Eminem. Bit late there, weren't you, Carl? Put your little headphones on. Cleaning out my closet. What are you doing? I got a stuff her face with toilet paper competition. Yeah. Do you know, we. When we were writing the TV show, I was filming it just for our own amusement, just to sort of. I suppose, more as a document, really, so that if there was ever, you know, a court of court law that needed evidence of Ricky Gervais's. I don't know what it is, really. Sickness, annoyance. He did this for about two hours. He. You see what he's doing now? He's stuffing his face with toilet roll. Yeah. And freshen the lips out so I could just show him teeth. You know, that actually makes me want to be sick. I know. Actually gag a little bit. Yeah. It's horrible. Good. Well, while Ricky does that, Carl, it's time for your quiz. See, this is what this is on telly, right? You don't have to be quiet or you've got to take that toilet paper out. I'm really serious. Because it's really annoying. Okay. You're gonna be quiet. Yeah. An example of the game just in case people didn't hear the launch of it last week. It's. It's a song title. I tell a little story. And that song. And that little story is a song in it. Yeah. Right. So say, for example, what did we do last week? What did we do last week? The woman who. Oh, yeah. A woman who really wants to, like, have a bath because she stinks. Yeah. But she can't because if she had a bath or a shower or a wash or whatever, she'd end up killing herself. Yes. No, you didn't say that. Killing herself. Well, anyway, as an example, that would be one of the stories. The answer, though, she's electric. She's come out of a shower because she would have ended up Killing herself. Yeah. Yeah. Right, so this week's, then. And don't say it if you know it, because the idea is that people can. There's this bloke and he buys a new house, right? And he's well happy with it. His girlfriend moves in with him and stuff, and she says, right, you know, let's. Let's clean it up a bit, yeah? And, you know, straight away, it'll be worth more money. Good idea. So she says, right, you do the kitchen and I'll do upstairs. And then that. She's stripping the kitchen down. And he goes upstairs and he's in the bedroom and notices little. Little hole to the attic. Oh, right, brilliant. So he goes, oh, I wonder how much room's up there. You know, I've never weighed it up. So he goes up there and it's all, like, dusty and a mess. And he goes, this could make a good bedroom, this. So he starts cleaning it all out, puts all the rubbish, like bins, the rubbish straight away. And there's little boxes with bits in that don't belong to it. I wonder what's in here. So he opens one of the boxes. It's like a little lamp, all right? He goes, this might be worth a few quid, right? And he rubs it, magic lamp and all. Like, all the room goes all sparkly and stuff. He goes, oh, what's going on? And then this fellow appears, right, In a nice sort of. In a nice sort of pair of 501s, right? And he says, what do you want? I know already. So all the. All the first bit is irrelevant. Yeah, but it's about building the story. It. So don't say anything if you think you know it. Steve, do you know it? I don't. So I just quickly recap the end there. I almost missed the end. So there you go. He's in. He's in the attic, right? His missus is still downstairs. She's not up there, okay? He's on his own. And he cleans this lamp, right? And this. This fella appears out of all this smoke. And he's wearing a nice pair of 501s, and he's wearing a shirt. And there you go. What's. What's. What's the song? What song are you thinking of? The lines are going mental. Let's. Let's play record, Carl. We'll come back and we'll. And we'll find out if anyone's got that, right? That's a great one, Carl, really. Did you just come up with that? Literally in the last 10 years. Genius. This is genius. Definitely. I mean, if those calls aren't from major TV companies, I don't know. I mean, dynamite stuff. A lot of them are. What's his name's lawyer Simon. That's my favorite thing I've done for years. Yeah, not bad, not bad. That's great background to form there. So, yeah, okay, line. The. The lines are going mental just because it's easy. Go on then. But you first want to get it. But what. It's not that, though. The Rick, I mean Carl, has just decided to revise the actual rules of the competition. So that we've decided is very easy. So that's now a qualifier. And so then they have to answer one live. Exactly. So whoever gets that one right as well. Because some people will lose the will to live. Just get a cut to the chase. And because they've got qualify now, we're throwing an office DVD that. I already seen that. Wouldn't you? Yeah. Increases value by 42 pence. We'll just go live. Yeah. Hello, XFM. Yeah, hi, how's it going? I'm not too bad, not too bad. A very, very quick recap, Carl, if you will, please. For the. For the. For the people listening, very quick, right? A man ends up in a loft. Man's after moving into this house and that's. He's in the loft and he's tidying up. His missus is downstairs doing the kitchen because that needed doing. He's up there, he's cleaning up, emptying the boxes. He finds a little like a little. Fella comes out wearing 501s. What's the song? What's the song, mate? Are you talking to me? Yeah, sorry, yeah. Look, look, I'm sitting in this bar, right? I'm not ringing out relating to anything that's going on right now. I'm after one of these armb to. Go and meet Bowie on Monday. Can you help me out? What? What? Piss off. You can't say that to our public. Yes, I can. What I can't bear is people begging Rick on the radio. You know, I can't bear it. Is that the Australian bloke who's got the British bridge? Steve's kids. Hello, xfm. Hello. Hello. Are you phoning up for an armband? No, no. Okay, great. Gene Genie. Of course it is. Well done, well done. Right, what's your name? Everyone else can ring off now because this, this. Well, she might not take the challenge. What's your name? Hello, what's your name? Christina. Christina, Right, do You want to take on the challenge? Yeah, yeah. So this is for. She's already won a couple of CDs. This is for the office DVD. Okay. Signed by Ricky Gervais. This is the same game again, but we're doing it live. All right, so this is a song title, right? There's this. There's this insect. I'm loving it already. Right? Yeah. And it's. It's in it. It's in its little, like, nest. And all the other insects, all its mates and that, are really, like, working the grafting hard. They're tidying up. Some of them are going out, getting the food. Some of them even got heads. They're still working. Some of them are like, you know, rushing around. But there's this one insect who's just sat there with its feet up and it's like, you know, just doing nothing. It's annoying all the other ones, but it's sat there and it's sat there doing nothing. Having a little, like, fag in that. What's the song? I don't know. Oh, my God, I'm brainless. Hold on. I don't know this either. So obviously it's a type of insect. That's why you've avoided saying what it is. So it's. So it's something like lazy ant, lazy bee. Well, we should throw it back open to the public. And I want to help this. Help this poor woman who's called in and now got a stupid one. But Christina's lost it now. She's lost it. No, she's blown it, Rick. Oh, sorry. Because you changed the rules halfway through. Anyway, she done that. She haven't got a DVD player, so she's not bothered. Okay. All right. Cheers then, Christina. See you later. So we can throw that back out then, can we? Well, I don't know. Is there anyone on the phone? Yeah, go on, take the next person. So what was it? There's some bugs. There was a bug and one of them wasn't doing any work. They say loads of them are working really hard. This one's just sat there doing nothing, annoying them. All right, so, xfm. Hello. I'm glad to say it's in Carl Perkinson's mind. I like him. Hello, xfm. I like him. Hello? Hello? Oh, yeah, Is it Animal Nitro by Swade? No, it's not. Good answer. Good answer. Is it a good answer? That doesn't make any sense. Does. Does. I know, like Carl does. Yeah. Hello, xfm. Hello. Hello. Is it Itchaku Park? No, no. Itchy Coo Park Bugs are itchy. Yeah, sure. I think they're stubborn. They're starting to think like Carl, which I like. Go on. Next one. I like Scratch Pervert. No, it's not Scratch Pervert. He's come out of nowhere. There, that's good. It's something to do with Lazy Bug or Lazy and. Hello, it's me. Hello. Hello. Hi. Is it Beetle Bum? Excellent. Beetle Bum. Of course. Beetle Bum by Blur. Sat around doing nothing. It's right Bum. Okay, I don't win anything now. Well done. No, you don't. She does. She wins the office dvd. Take the name and address. She doesn't because she didn't do the qualifier. She knew it was Gene Genie. Oh, Carl. Let someone win somewhere. It's kind of listening to you for 10 minutes, lads. Can we give away some things? Lads? We just come down for a moment once again, but I just draw you to my point at the top of the show when you are pissing about outside in the office. We could have been working through this. Yeah. We could have been figuring out the rules. We could have had maybe some music, some jingles. Who's that? Who's that? What? What's your name again? Can we do this off? Let's. Yeah. No, he's not going to give her an address that. We're rubbish. So rubbish. We are. Really. What's your name? D. D okay, we'll play a record and we'll get your address D and we'll send you some stuff. Thank you. You should come in an hour early. We should sort this stuff out. This is what I've been saying all along. I've been saying we should come in preparations to do. Simon Mayo used to come in early. That was what he didn't have to. Sleep and eat breakfast. Come back around by Feeder on XFM 104.9 I'm Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant and our producer there. I say, producer, Kyle Pilkington. All right, all right. Yeah, we got. We got to slicken up this thing. If we're going to be as good as Mayo, we've got to. We got to come in early and do the work. Yeah, let's get in at 10 to 1 next week. We're not in it next week, are we? I mean, we would be if it weren't for. So what are you doing? Holiday. Already? You've done three weeks, but. Yeah. You need a little rest. Yeah, well, I wasn't on holiday last time. I was working. Sure. So you're just gonna do a best Of Aya. Yeah, just dig out some bits. And what are you gonna do? Just lump them together? Just like pick some. Some favorite bits. Yeah, Right, I'll fill up 10 minutes. Do this, then do the. Do the. Do the links then. So. Well, why don't we do some sort of stock links now? Okay then. Do you remember that, Steve? Oh, that was a great moment. Yeah. I'll tell you what, though. I loved a bit when he. Well, just play. Just play it. Right, so there's one of them. Can you do a proper intro? So it's like, you know. Okay. Oh, what? You know what song we're going to come out of? Say, just say generic, like. That's a good song. Well, let's. Well, no, no, let's. Okay, well, what do you want to start off with next week then? Give them a few options. Okay. That was a great trip by Oasis. Oh, yeah, Oasis there. Well, we're not actually here today, Steve. We recorded these last week. I'm on holiday. What you do? Just. You're just probably chilling out with a lady. Yeah, yeah, but leave me alone. Stop phoning, ladies. This is like the best of. The best of last year. And we're gonna kick off with it with a classic clip. Who can forget this? All right. Yeah. Then just weave that in. Yeah, yeah. And then come out of that, come into a record or summer. So I come up another record. Just. Just one more, just in case I need it. Okay. Oh, I don't know. That was Bob the Builder there. Shouldn't really be playing on xfm, but. Stupid car. Stupid. Don't know what you're thinking, mate. You buffoon. Yeah. Oh, okay. I know. Ah, great track. I love that. Yeah, beautiful. Wow. Come on, let's get these right. He needs to use these next. Another. Great. We'll just do this later. I've gotta go. I've gotta run away to the airport. Yeah, yeah, but this isn't gonna work. It's a mess. Well, just. Oh, yeah. For this show you can slot right in. Yeah, I'm talking of a mess, mate. Your competition. Yeah, it was a shambles today. I mean, last week we gave it the benefit of the doubt because it was the first time we've done it. But you've got to think it through, mate. You can't be making up on the spot like that and changing the rules. Yeah, I'm sorry, mate. I mean, I know you didn't did it with the best intentions, but it was. I'm worried that people think we get at Carl and everything, but that Was appalling. Yeah, it was terrible. It was interminable. I think you've got to compress those stories, you've got to tighten them. Right. He gets paid to put like 30 quid extra for this as well. So I mean he's getting good money for it. Listen, right, you say that you got to compress it, right? I. The way I look at like competition. It's like Colombo. Right. The murder bit at the end is done in like three minutes but you drag it out for an hour. Yeah. So you sort of make it exciting and like, oh, I wonder where he's going with this. Sure. And it worked. You know D. Hudson, she's walking away with the dvd, she's laughing. Dee's fine. She's the only one who's gained. Everyone else has had a miserable time. Yeah. Of course she's happy, she's won something. But what about the listeners? There's no entertainment. I mean they're loving it now because me and Steve are on and this is scintillating stuff. Yeah, this is amazing stuff. Talking about we're not going to be here next week and doing next week's links. Yeah. Because I can't be bothered to come in early. Okay. Wow. Excellent. Well, it's. That's quarter to two, Steve on xfm. I've enjoyed this wonderful collection of our greatest moments. Yeah. There's still more to come. You'll be next back well next week, won't you? Yeah, I'll be back next week. I can't do the last one. Well, I hope you enjoyed some of the best of moments there with. I'm not gonna use these. Why not? They're a mess. Forget it. Forget it. Well, forget it. We'll do them in a bit when you're done. I'm not telling. I cannot do it. When'd you play Plane? It doesn't matter when the plane is. We can do it in a bit. I'm definitely, I'm not wasting my time going through that. We're getting it. My favorite suede song there. Stay together, Buy suede, Stay together. That's what you're being paid for. Well, no, because it could have been a suede song sung by Atomic Kitten. Sure. And like I said, that's my favorite suede song by Atomic Kitten. Yeah. Yeah. So thanks for that. Do you think this is the worst show we've ever done? No, I mean we've done some God awful shows in the past. Really? Yeah. Okay. I mean some real grim ones in the past. Okay. Do you think people See through it even before we tell them that we're not really cutting the mustard, putting the effort in. We've got. We had nothing to say last week. No, I don't think anyone's fooled. I think really some people are tolerating us because they quite like your TV work. But I mean, other than that, I. Think they haven't played good music. Well, we don't skip on the tunes. But if I was listening to this, I'd be thinking I could do a better job. I'd be leaving. If I worked in like some. If I worked in like a bakery or something, and I was like, I hate this job. And listening to us, you know, gibboning about on the radio, I'd be livid. I'd be angry. Really? Yeah. I mean, if this was a BBC show, I'd go mental. Why? Because I'd be paying a license fee and everything. So, okay, it was my money being squandered. But we don't have to. This is advertisers money being squandered. Yeah. You know, this is big corporations. Screw them. Yeah. And people haven't paid anyway, have they? A lot of them haven't. They probably paid, paid for the batteries in their radio. Maybe if they're listening. We're so sorry about that. Yeah, well, I feel guilty just for wasting their time, Rick. But next week's gonna be a clip show again. Yeah, Carl's gonna do. We're decided that Carl's gonna just do the links next week by himself. Or maybe just guess, a guest hosted, maybe a. You know, like, what was that Dennis. Norton type, you know, in the Sony Awards, you hand in one show, don't you? Yeah, we could hand in next week's, couldn't we? Because it was broadcast in this year. Just that it's a clip show from years ago. Because you could hand I love 1975, couldn't you? In the Baftas or something. You could, yeah. So should we. Are you. Are you. You're even bored, aren't you? You're bored with this show as well. This is terrible attitude. I'm just. We're allowed to be bored. We're the. We're the talent. I thought you were gonna give us like 10 minutes after the show to do them. But I can't. I've got to go. Yeah, right, Steve, Because Ricky's taxi might be waiting now, so. No, it's this attitude, Ricky. You gonna put up with that? I just don't believe it. They. They should be chomping at the bit together. They should. I can't believe their luck. Do you know what I mean? Sure. Sure. And do I get treated any different? No. Worse. Yeah. Answers on a postcard, if you can figure out what that sentence meant. And there'll be a DVD on its way to you. Listen, we had an email from Glenn and Sharon, and Sharon was rushed into hospital last week, and they wanted us to play something for her. She's back now and she's okay. But anyway, they always listen to the show. They're big fans. They asked for some Nick Drake. I'll play some Nick Drake next time, but. But instead I thought we could play a classic Dylan track. I'd be a big fan of Dylan. Yeah. Just like a woman. It's just beautiful. And. And that's my song for the ladies. We won't see you next week. Ricky's away. But there should be a hilarious compilation for our best moments. Oh, I look forward to that.",
