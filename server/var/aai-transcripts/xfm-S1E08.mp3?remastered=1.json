He doesn't even turn up. And now suddenly he's all over breakfast. I noticed. Yeah. He's standing in for the Breakfast Show. Why wouldn't we ask to do that? Well, yeah. I didn't know about this. Yeah. But I don't want to get up that early. Sure, sure. I feel a bit hungover today, actually. Yeah. What's happening? What? Were you partying last night? Were you? Well, not partying. We just went out. Went out for a couple of drinks and had a meal and then went to the Borderline and saw. But I'll tell you about that. You saw a band. That's the first time in years, isn't it? It is, yeah. Yeah. Because you know John Sim, the actor? Not really. He's in this van, right. With Magic. Magic Alex. And it was really good. They're sort of like. Sort of like a friendly oasis. They got, you know, sort of quite. You know, it's quite Mank sort of feel. But it's really good. Good songs and everything. Is he the singer? Yeah. No, he's a guitarist. Nice. Cool. But it was full of actors because it. Because. And I felt quite tall. That's ludicrous. Because you're a very short man. Well, I am. I'm sort of. I was average, but now I'm not. I don't think five foot eight, that's what. But there I was, like, quite. It was like Lilliput. So I just gotta hang out. Actors, Dudes. Yeah. This is the reason, because actors are often very quite handsome people. But yet they're always quite obvious. We are, we are. We are. We are. No, I mean, they're normally quite obnoxious. Rick again, you know, you're a good example of that. And yet I think it must be the small man complex. That's what makes them so obnoxious and so kind of desperate for attention. I didn't realize it before. Steady on. Because, of course, I tower above everyone. You do, don't you? I'm for people who don't know. Who are listening. I'm 6 foot 7 inches tall. That's. That's. That's. That's high. Yeah. And. And. And for people who've never seen him, he doesn't hold it well. It's not like he's a sort of handsome athlete, is it, Carl? He's a bit of a. What would you call him, Carl? Don't answer. No, no, no. Get drawn into that. You know. You know the game he's playing. No, no, no, no. Do you know yesterday when you were in the office. Yeah. You did a little move and it reminded me of Blakey. Oh, I hate you, Gervais. Oh, I hate you, Pilkington. That's stance. Yeah, but even he was. He held it a little bit better, didn't he? Because he was a mat. You know, he had a big coat and everything in a pink cap. But. Yeah. I can't believe you. Like, I've not suffered enough from being freakishly tall. Now two of my best buddies. Yeah. Live on radio. It's not just height, though, is it? It's the posture in the face and everything. But it's got your places on it. No. What do you mean, it's got me places? I think. I think people give you a bit more of a chance in your career and stuff. It's like. Well, yeah, stacking shelves because I can reach to a high. Let. Muse plug in, baby. On XFM 104.9. Ricky, go on. Well, yeah, but I know you guys are laughing about the height thing, and for those that have only just tuned In, I am 6 foot 7 inches tall, which is. Which is tall. And that's big. And like, you know, I pride myself on it in a way. You know, I've worked hard, I've not smoked, I ate well, you know. Yeah, it's an accomplishment, but obviously I didn't have much involvement in it. I just. And it's a curse because mainly the problem is that you. You can't get stuff, you can't get clothes, you can't get shoes. Yeah, yeah, that's. But it is genuine. And I don't know, I mean, it costs a lot to buy a pair of size 14 shoes and it. So I don't. I mean, if you're poor, if you were genuinely poor, but I don't know how you'd afford to be tall because the clothing costs more. Everything costs. I've seen this in comics, that you'd actually go to school in a barrel. Wearing a barrel with just braces. It'd just be a barrel and you'd have sort of flip flops and you'd take a mule with you. They would have a mule, didn't they? The poor people always think, like it, that they, like, you'll be in a pub or something and people. I mean, people just Think they can talk to you about it. They just think it's just like. Because it's like. But that really annoys you, doesn't it? Well, it annoys me because it's like they think I should be proud of it. Well, exactly. But they don't think that. This is not a disadvantage. This is not a disadvantage. Disability is that you're, you're taller than most people. It might get disability if you were 8 foot 3. It'd be slightly disabilitating. You would, you know. But what? Disabilitating? Yeah. No, you're a medical man, aren't you? But no, the point is it's a disabilitating because go on public transport. Like if you're on a coach. Yeah. The only place I can sit on a coach is that seat on the driver's lap. Either on the driver's or that seat at the very end. Yeah. You know where. Which is kind of. Which sits into the aisle. Yeah, that's the only place I could stand up. Some sort of stand at the back waving at drivers. You could drive it from the back. Here it comes. Watch it. Were you a tall baby. Mr. Mrs. Merchant, you've given birth to a basketball player. Look at his dribble already. Were you a tall baby? Babies aren't tall. At what point did, did you suddenly like Jesus? Nothing fits me. Well, it didn't happen overnight. Let's do a little graph. How tall are you at five? Oh, I don't know, three foot. Three foot. How tall were you at? 12, six foot six. What are you really? I don't know, do I? How do I remember? I don't remember this. Well, when did teachers start calling you freak boy? Didn't they so much? It was. No, he went to a funny school. I went bowling with him once. Well, I'd never been bowling before and he'd been once before. Anyway, let's go to this ball. We went to bowling alley, right? And you have to wear these special shoes. Now they're. They're sort of like pointed things anyway. And they're multi colored, sort of red and green. They look pretty weird. And, and the woman said to me, oh, what size? I said, oh, eight. Yeah. What size are you? 14. She went, 14. He went, you probably haven't got him. He goes, she goes, yeah, I think we have got one pair. And she put them on the table and it was like Crusty the Clown. And I just started laughing. They looked so long. And he had to run around this bowling alley in these freaky clowns. Don't look freaky clown like when I'm wearing them because the rest of me is in proportion to it. It looks like a little wall bracket. Doing the worst thing. One of the worst things that happened to me was when I was like, I don't know, when I was about 16 or something, we went to. It's a fire. There's a fire alarm going off. There's a fire alarm going off and. The fire lights going off. Should, should, should we not just maybe play a record and go and check that out? Wrap it up if you want. No, no, not wrap it up, play a record. I'm gonna go. No, see you later. It's gone off, Rick. It's gone off. Oh well, we might have burned down. Yeah, I think we'd know about it. The flames licking around our ankles would be a clue. God. I'm gonna go and investigate. You shouldn't ignore a fire alarm, should you? We're entertaining the nation. Oh, look at him, he's scared of fire. What do you mean? Mercury, the dark is rising. That's a good song, isn't it? I noticed that you're investigating the fire. Mainly involved wandering out into the office, looking around a bit, then coming back. Yeah. What did you find out? There was no fire. There was no fire? No. Right. But I love about it. Imagine that though. Imagine there's a fire and there's loads of firemen. They go get back. And you go to the firemen, all get back. Oh, look at him. And actually be justified to. Okay, there's heavy shedding, lads. Retreat. Oh, Brax. Sarge. I'm sorry, Braaak. Sarge? Yeah, there was a fire. I'd never seen it before, a fire thing going off. There was a fire. I thought, oh let's at least have a look if there's a fire. That's all I thought. See there's some official coming in now to tell us we should have been running out. There's no fire. Well, you can't just stop entertaining, you know, the people of London just because there's a fire. This isn't the Titanic. I don't have to carry on playing. I don't know, it feels like a bit of a sinking ship really. Nice one, nice one. I don't know who I'm tagging off then. Probably me. Yeah, I think so. Listen, let me just tell you briefly, this is another example of how people can just exploit you and make fun of you when you're tall. Yeah, I was quite tall. I've always been like about 6 foot 7 for quite a while now. And when I was about 16, I went to a big New Year's celebration in Bristol, where I come from. And they. Everyone kind of congregates in this big sort of part of town and there's all people dancing around, like in Trafalgar Square. And I was there, like somehow I sort of. I just picked up a balloon somewhere along the line, one of those kind of helium sort of balloons. I was holding that, dancing around, and these two girls came up to me. I was thinking, yeah, okay, you know, it's New Year's Eve. Brilliant. You know, that's my kind of party. Yeah, they come out, they went, hey, once a year. And they went, they said, you're gonna be here for long. And I went, well, maybe they said, it's just that we've arranged to meet back at you in about an hour. I mean. What do you mean? Well, it's just because we can see you wherever you are. Don't worry, you can move around and stuff. We'll see you with the balloon. Just arrange to meet some friends. I love that. A landmark. So like pilots use that. And we're just coming in there when we see Steve Merchant, we'll be descending to Bristol Temple me. What's really funny is New Year's Eve, Trafalgar Square, you've got a huge column, but the year Steve is like the meeting point. Steve's got a huge column. Brilliant, Rick. Well done. Award winning comedy from Ricky Germaine. Took you back, didn't it? Happy Monday's there Manxy. Now Carl's like really getting down. Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, come on. Got any Veras? Oh, come on, Mel. To take you back. Did it? Yeah. How old are you? 29. So you were. Oh, you were just going into, out of your teens. I'm a Virgo. No. What? No, that, that. No, you don't understand. It's just we discussed about involving. Yes. Management have told us we're just not allowed to do. We've had emails from people. Please don't speak to Carl. It's cruel. Exactly. I'm a cusp. Can I just make an appeal? I don't want to. I'm a cosplay Reverg. I said. Still going through with it. Doesn't know what's going on. Does he just wave bright objects at him. Yeah, yeah. We've got a competition this Steve. We have. But before we mention that, can I just ask something? I don't want to exploit our position on the radio. No, but I wonder Because I'm very tall, it's very tricky for me to get size 14 shoes and big clothes and stuff. Can I just get people to send some stuff if, like, maybe they own a shop? Yeah, but it'd be. It'd be things like homemade clogs that people have carved out of the chunks of wood they found in the shed. Whatever. It's not. When I was in America, everyone says to me, are you good to America? It is a Kakul. I'm out of my own skin. When I was in America, everyone told me, like, it would be, you know, really easy to get big clothes and big shoes and that, because they're all huge and all freaks over there. All right, all right, all right. Steady are. I was wandering around New York and I was going in a few shops, kind of saying, you've got size 14 US 15 shoes. And they were going, no. Is that the difference? 1. And they literally were laughing at me. There was a couple of shops where they literally laugh and get, like, someone else in and come and look at the tall, freaky Englishman. Really? One guy said, oh, I remember we had someone come in here once. And he said he'd been to a shop, sold kind of stuff for really tall people. And. And. And he said, I think I can remember the address. And he sort of looked at the sort of telephone director and he made a note of it. And I went on the subway and I went there. I went. Because it took me ages to get and really hard to find it. I finally went in there. I've never seen. It was heaving, right. With freaks, really. It was like they're just kind of gargoyles. It was like something from Lord of the Rings. They're just getting these tall people and kind of gnarled. They turn around and start bowing to you. It was incredible. Yeah. And I just said, hi, I'm looking for a kind of sort of. I went, yeah, sure. And he sort of hobbled off into the darkness and came back with exactly the kind of pair of shoes I wanted. I couldn't believe my luck. It might be a magic shot, but it was like. It was like that shop in Mr. Ben. It might have been a dream, though. You see. Did you. Have you still actually got the shoes? No, because when Mr. Ben sort of like goes back and wakes up next day, he finds, like, a feather in his pocket where he remembers he was a, you know, a 17th century sort of squire or something. You know what I mean? The classic episode of Mr. Pen when he becomes a 17th century squire. Mr. Ben learns to play the harpsichord. Like when Mr. Ben, that black shopkeeper, goes, right, are you gonna pay for. You're not just gonna go through that door and they have an adventure and come back. Yeah, I am. No, you're not. You're barred. Yeah. You just make me sick. We wait nothing from you. Well, I'm not in this for your amusement, Mr. Ben. Is it only Ben who's got the insider knowledge about the magical doorway or. I don't know. Because that fella in the fez doesn't seem to have anyone else there. No, rarely. He's always grinning, though. He knows something. I. I'm not sure. It's not a documentary, though, is it? It's a kid show, innit? I can't remember. No, it's not. It's just a kid's show, so anything can happen. That's a lot of people make that mistake. Sure. When they slag off something like do or Thundercats. It's not. Not really reality. It's just a kid, Mr. Ben. They were all on drugs, weren't they? Like magic reindeer. My mate fancied Cheetah from Thundercats. Which one was Cheetah? I quite like. She was. She was. She was the lovely. She's a lovely cat. She was a real dish. What's the. What's the. What's the sexiest cartoon? I'm glad you've asked. A lot of people say Jessica Rabbit. They do. And they'd be right to say that because she's actually human. She's not an animal. Which is good. What? Isn't she? No, no, she. She's a normal woman married to a rabbit. No, yeah. Jessica Rabbit. Is that what. She got a surname? Rabbit. But she's not actually a rabbit. She's married Roger Rabbit. But she's not actually a rabbit. She's a glamorous woman. Is she? Yeah, yeah. I've never seen it. No. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is the weird thing about it. That's weird though, isn't it? It is weird. The idea of a rabbit having sex with a beautiful woman. That is the weirdest thing about it. How does that make you feel? Annoyed, if I'm honest. Yeah. But I bought some bunny ears just after I saw the film. Oh, hip hop. You got your hip hop shot. Oh, yeah. Good. No, no. This album was rated by a lot of people last year. My sources tell me that it's being re released and re recorded. Anyway, nerd are the outfit. They're better known as the Neptunes, who are kind of sort of Hip hop, R B producers. Yeah. Yeah. I think this track may have featured on a giveaway cd. It did the Enemy. It did. Anyway, it's dynamite. It's from the album In Search of by Nerd. And it's Bobby James. Play It. Nerd from the album In Search of. And that's Bobby James. Brilliant. It's great. It's really big. It reminds me a little bit of Warren G, that. That. Cause, sure, yeah, yeah, yeah. And apparently the album. I don't. It was on kind of limited release, so it's quite tricky to get hold of. But as I say, I think they're re releasing it. Well, you should tape off the radio because we're doing lots of features. Yeah, no, I'll maybe play that again in the future. Just tape it off. I'll tell you what, I'll play the whole album over the course of like next couple of weeks. Yeah. And we're just, I mean, you know, talking. We just go now and you can. Say, we can advocate you tape off the radio because that's breaking. Or maybe I'll just do some bootlegs of the. You know, I can just sell them. Market, you know, for four quid. Exactly. Fine. Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. I mean, you know, we were. I mean, we, you know, we shouldn't. Really say that, but Warren G is Dr. Dre's cousin. Is he? Or Summer. Is he. Is that right? I think he's his cousin. Yeah. But I. I know he's got a famous brother as well. And I found. I think it's like Nate Dog. We could. Maybe someone would know that and could email. Phone in. Yeah. Or email. Maybe this is the best thing about. Being on the radio. I can. I can think of somewhere there was a competition, right. On Virgin, right. I was listening. Virgin, I think 105 point. No. What is it? I can't remember. Good station, good station. And they had a competition, right? And it was to win a trip to America. For the. On the Enterprise, it was all about space. And there's one. There was one question. Answer three. Right? And it was. Who was the first one into space? Yuri Gagarin. Who's done a. And then third question was how. How much bigger than the moon is the sun? Is it twice as big or four times as big? And this one went four times, but he went correct. It's not. It's hundreds of times bigger. I can't believe. Couldn't someone look that up on the Internet? How many times bigger is the sun than the moon? It's not four Times. It's. It's huge. It's like beach ball to a P type dimension. Which DJ was it? Remember on Virgin? I can't remember, but it was the one on sort about 11:00. Yeah. He's embarrassed himself. When we do quizzes, we never get anything wrong. That's true. During that track, I'm. I'm chilling out. I'm loving it, aren't I? Carl goes, do you know how baguettes came about? Do you know how baguettes come about? I went, go on. And Steve went, no, save it. Wait a minute though. I'm thinking, Rick, people are going to be desperate to know the answer to that. Why don't we play some ads and some music and stuff? It's like a cliff. Exactly. How did baguettes come about? Whatever he says is going to be good. Stay tuned to XFM to find out. Hives. Hate to say I told you so. So I love that sort of stuff. That and the Strokes. So much better than this new metal rubbish, isn't Definitely. Now most people think we talk rubbish on air. Yep. If they could hear the conversations that go on. I know, but someone just emailed in saying the sun is indeed about 400 times bigger than the moon. Thanks for that. That DJ must have looked up and said, 400 times. That can't be right. It's probably. They probably. It's probably printing error. 4 times. Nothing can be 400 times bigger than the moon. Carl went, yeah, but the sun's only got a million years. And why he went on that space program, it said, in a million years the sun will destroyed. And he said, and then we're all shafted. Right. I went, I laughed. Steve went, no, it's okay. By then we'd be on another planet. I think that's true. We'll have colonized planets. Carl went, yeah, but there'd be no sun. Steve went, well, there's other sons. Which is true. Car went, well. I went, well, yeah, every star is a sun. Car went, well, not. Not really. Don't believe that. Yeah. And I went, no, it is. The sun is just a star. It's not even tricky. Big star. Carl went, well, why didn't they say that? Instead of worrying me. Instead of worrying me. In a million years time he's been preserved, brought back to life and is now the ruler of the world. Just a head in a fish tank. And he speaks like this. I am Pilkington. The reason. The reason you became king of the universe, of course, is because of your fascinating French bread. Anecdote. Oh, yeah, yeah. Come on then. How did baguettes come about? If this is going to be. Someone cooked a loaf a bit wrong and said, I can still make a sandwich out of it. I'm gonna hit you. No, no, no, no. Go on then. Right. Napoleon when he was at war and that with Russia, 1812. Yeah, yeah. All these soldiers were like, you know, not used to the cold weather and that. So they said, take some clothes in your bag with you because it's going to be nippy, nippy out there. So they put all the clothes in the bag. Sure. Do what they were told. It's Napoleon, for Christ's sake. No room for any food. You're joking. So could they make some sort of like sandwich? No, it wouldn't fit because of all the clothes. You have to take extra gear. So anyway, I can see where this is going. Is there a baguette shaped gap left in their hold? All they thought, let's make some bread that you can fit down your trouser leg. What? That's not true. I read it in Euston train station. I was waiting to go back to Manchester. Where did you read these at the morning. Yeah. Was it also. Meet me here for at 12 o'clock. The upper Cross Sandwich Shop, Houston Station. It's on the wall. What do you mean it's on the wall? Do you know, it says like, sail on at Dixon's. Whatever. Next to that there was like a bit of information. Once you've read the stuff on Dixon information there was. There's a big thing about the history of the baguette. We got. We got to make a sandwich. We can spit down our trouser leg. But how can you march and fight with a huge piece of bread down here? Although it would be intimidating. You see him coming, you go, sacre bleu. Look at the size of them. They're their big fellas. Well, blimey, I. I can't ever feel that could be a practical joke at your expense. Yeah, well, the Earl of Sandwich you read if it's printed up. Is that like fact for you then? Well, it's not funny. I mean, if they were trying to be funny, it's like. It's not, is it? So it's infernal. Have you heard us things? That's exactly what happened with the sound, with the Earl of Sandwich wanted somebody could fit down his pants. And it was those triangle cut sandwiches wrapped in cling film with perfect. You might be right. You might be right. I am. Because the Cornish past is so they could drop it down the mines in it. Yeah, they wrapped it up, you know, they wrapped up like meat and vegetables in pastry and they sort of crimped it and it was like a little. And they dropped it down the mine. So, yeah, that's how that came about. And bagels were originally made so that people could play hoopla but then eat afterwards. I don't know if you're aware of that. That is true. Well, anyway, call my bluff. Yeah, they're all true. Tell your kids that when you have them. Yeah. You know, if they're still alive in a million years. Well, it might be true. Can someone confirm that baguette fact that it was so Napoleon could stick it down his trousers? Not him. His soldiers, his men. Yeah. Fascinating information. Fascinating bread information, Carl. Radio Ed. Yeah. Now, this is my song for the lovers. It's a beautiful track. It's let down off. Ok, computer. It's one of my favorite radio strokes. It's lovely. Right, set the tape going now, if you want to take those songs. Avalanches, Frontier cycle, psychiatrists. Absolutely. Well, we've had lots of emails, people. Obviously we inflamed and provoked the Cornish pasty. I've got a couple of amendments to that. That the crusty bit, you know, is actually as a handle because obviously the miners had dirty hands and they'd eat the. All the stuff in the pasty and they'd be left with this sort of crust and they could throw that away. Also, someone told us that at one end was a apple, so you have a little sweet as well, little dessert. So there you go. You noticed how like over the years we've been doing this, you know, way back when we started xfm, no one ever contributes. When we ask about the music, we ask about hip hop there, you know, opinions on that, anything important. But start talking about pasties. Yeah, we've had about five phone calls. Yeah. And someone. Someone phoned up to confirm they used to work for Upper Crust. And basically Carl got all excited, so. So it is true. She went, well, I don't know if it's true. I've read the same sign you did, Carl. Interesting. There's an email here that says. Which basically offers a history of the baguette and talks about after the revolution, the government decreed that all of France must eat the same bread. It was up to the bakers to bake this bread of equality. And then Napoleon kind of made sure it was a particular. He kind of set in. Yeah, obviously on the bread you can eat anything you find in the Garden frogs, snails, bits of horse. But the interesting thing is, Rick, that there's no mention of sticking it down your trousers whilst going to war. The French have tried to keep that secret for over a hundred years. Upper crust people. Yeah, yeah, nearly. Nearly 200 years. That is a top secret. Somehow Euston Station, upper crust, got hold of a document left behind in an old sea chest, possibly Napoleon's. Could have been Josephine's. Unfortunately, jotted it down. He's kicking himself now. Oh, sacra. I cannot believe I left a note. If he talked like that. He did. He did. He did that. Yeah, yeah, he talked English, but in a very funny French accent. Do you remember? There's one thing that. Talking about funny French accents, you remember Alo. Hello. Yeah, Remember it was on about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, but they still met because it was a funny Frenchman. It was that. That English guy who was posing as a French police officer. It's very complicated. He would often walk by and I remember there was one where he said, I was pissing by the door when I heard they shit. Oh, yeah, now that. Passing by the door. Passing by the door when I heard a shot. That's what he's saying. I'm allowed to say that at 2:00. That. I'm just saying I'm talking in a French accent. Yeah, I was pissing by the door when I heard a shit. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, because I'm speaking French. Do you know what I mean? That's the rule. Do you know why people tinkle the tink the glasses before they have a drink? Why they tink the verb to tink? I do know that, Carl. Is it about poison? It is. Here we are. What? Would it make a different noise? Oh, brilliant. Go on, explain why. You explain it, Steve. No, no, no, don't, Steve, you explain it. Carl, come on. I've started, so I'll finish. Come on, Carl, explain why they tink the glasses. Ages ago, yeah? Only people with money are drinking or something. Years ago. Welcome to history. Now, now, ages ago, only people with money had drinking or something. Keep going, keep going. Like spirit and stuff. So they'd. It's like businessmen, business businessmen. It's easy for you to say. This is getting to be cruel, isn't it? This is amazing. Yeah, go on. Why did you open your mouth? What were you hoping was the best that could happen? Because you're trying to make me look stupid. Before with the planet. So where is you now? Yeah, go on now. Come on. Businessman. No, businessmen with money. I'VE got to drink. I'm Ching. Okay, so then. So they nip round to have a chat about the. Whatever they're earning money with, and they'd say, right, do you want a drink, then? Oh, yeah, that'd be all right. So rather than, like, just pouring it out of a bottle into a glass and saying, there you go. It could be going, hang on a minute. Could be poisoning me here and trying to, like, nick me. Business idea. Yeah, yeah. So what, they do it, sort of pour a bit of his drink into the other person's glass and you get that Tink noise and that's like. Like, cheers, you know. No, no, Carl, I just have a slight amendment there. I think what it was, was you're absolutely right that they would then test each other's drinks to see that show that it wasn't poison. But over the years, that was reduced to just chinking the glasses by way of saying, let's not actually bother going through the whole rigmarole. They just did the checking of the glasses. Yeah, that's. That's. That's good. It was exhausting, though, wasn't it? I know. Was it worth it, do you think? Well, I like that because people carry that with them now when they do that. They think, oh, that bloke's definitely not trying to poison me. Yeah. So the horrible thing is that now when I do the glasses, I can laugh and go, they don't know I've poisoned them. Exactly. You should always do the pouring back and forth. It's a shortcut. It's a slippery slope, you know, Just be careful, Ash. There's a star, one of my bands of 2001. Ash, was it? Yeah, they've come through. I didn't like them at first thought, you know, a bit. Bit too low fi. But I think they've worked at it. They do good songs, they're good performers, and I think they're probably thoroughly nice chaps. Sure. All right. We didn't say hello because we were away for a couple of weeks. We didn't come back and go, oh, we're back, did we? It's like nothing ever happened. Exactly. Do you know what I mean? Have a good Christmas. Yeah, yeah. Yep. Carl? Yeah, it's all right. Lovely. Okay, let's crack on. Good. My. I went on holiday after Christmas. Yeah. Yeah. And so did our mutual friend Phil Bowker. Yeah, Good man. He was in Lanzarote and he told me one of the funny. I don't know if I can tell this on the radio. I'll have to say the C word. I'll just go, it's in a sentence so I just go, you see, when it comes and you'll know that they're saying the terrible word Just, you know, didn't want to ruin the anecdote. Anyway, they're walking along one evening in Anzarati and there's lots of Brits there apparently and Phil overhears a sort of married couple arguing. They're having to go home a bit early and she's saying to him, she went, for Christ's sake, every time we come out drinking, you always yourself, right? Wow. Always. Not once. So he's going, ah, I've told you. He said it's not the drink, it's the weather. She went, the weather. You'll be blaming the food next, you see I don't think they should have got married. When did you think the shooting itself started? Must have been after the marriage because if it they, you know, you're caught in and you go. Went out with Derek again did you, last night? Yeah. How was it? It was. The evening was lovely, the meal was nice again. That's. That's five dates, five different heaps of. But I think I can change him. I think I changed him. Yeah it must have happened after the Marion. Oh he just might think, oh God, I got. Always got the age where I think, look, I'll just empty it when I get home, yeah I'm not going to keep going up and going to the toilet, you know it's the ice that does it. Ye, Carl is right, I think it is the ice. What do you mean? People forget, you know they say, oh don't, don't drink the water when you're on holiday and they don't, they drink, you know, they buy heavy on and stuff. Oh I see. Forget about the ice. The ice cubes. You're right. In a bar made from tap water. And that can do it can it? I assume that she wasn't drinking ice then. Yeah, well I mean, why has it just happened to him? Let's be honest, everyone that goes on holiday doesn't end up crapping themselves. Yeah, yeah, they usually make it to a toilet. He does it every time he drinks, doesn't he? Yeah, well apparently just don't let him carry the baguettes. Oh, he's good at. He. Oh, Carl comes out with. He does now and again. That was sweet man. Yeah, nice one. Yeah, respect you. Right, we've got another feature now. Yes, this is a feature which we introduced before Christmas and it was so Popular. We brought it into 2002 as well. We've carried it over with us. It's an interesting thing and I don't think. I don't think we'll ever run out of features for it. Gordon. What's the feature called, Steve? Brilliantly. It's rather brilliantly called A Song that I Like. Yeah. And in it. Let me explain. Go on, go on. What I do is in it, I play a song, what, that you like or I like. All right, so you just pick a few. Well, let me go. I'm going to explain this. All the songs right there are. Carl. Steve likes some of them. He doesn't like others. But for this particular feature, the only songs that will be in this section will be the ones that he likes. If you think you're gonna hear songs that I don't like, you're wrong. Let me feel out straight away. Yeah. Songs that I like. What song have you chosen? Chosen? To play. Thank you very much for asking. I have chosen and it's something I've only been introduced to recently, but I did enjoy it and it seemed, you know, just felt contemporary. It's Patti Smith and the classic. Oh, Fantastic. Gloria by Patti Smith. Did you enjoy that? Yeah, I love it. Always been one of my favorite tracks. And as Carl pointed out, sounds remarkably like. Who did you mention P.J. Harvey. Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, everyone knew that she was obviously very influenced by her. That's fine, that's fine. That's all right. That's allowed. That's. That's cool. I like PJ Harvey, too. Exactly. There's enough room for two. You're absolutely right. Oh, here we are. Let's just take a moment to think about what we've done. Yeah, well, it's been good. It's an hour, 20 minutes. We've. We've. We've talked about. Oh, in yourself. We talked about plastis. A number of pastries, actually, we did. Never got the. We should learn a competition. Who's the. Who's the tastiest cartoon ever? Well, actually, I threw up G Terror. I threw up Jessica Rabbit. I've had some people contribute here on email. We've got someone here. Dom has emailed us. He's told us that for him. Daphne from Scooby Doo. Yeah, popular choice. And obviously this is one I've. I've never quite understood. Wilma from the Flintstones. I've actually always felt that Wilma. I don't know, I just thought she was a bit. No, not Wilma. Betty, surely. Yeah, Betty. Well, this Is what I mean, Wilmer, I mean. Yeah, Betty, surely. But Wilma. No, I mean, she's quite homely. Come on, Steve, you wouldn't say no to Wilmer. No, I suppose not. I'd be worried about Fred if he found out. Well, I'd hate to do it, you know. I wouldn't want to do it to Fred. He's a good guy. He is, isn't he? He's a bit of a jump. Whereas Barney, to be honest, I don't think he deserves Betty. Do they both work in the quarry? Because I mean, let's be honest, Fred not a smart man. I mean, he also come out of Rock School with anything other than a couple of basic O levels. I know, but he's a hard, you know, he's a hard working sound sort of guy. A big house. They got like a tv. They got that bird thing. Yeah. I mean, be honest, if I was Fred, I would be a little bit disappointed that my kid does nothing. Whereas Barneys can lift up sort of tall buildings. Bam. Bam. He's a very strong, you know. I mean, interesting me. Fred loves his job. He's all yabba dabba doing at the end of the day all day lifting rocks from one place to another. I'll tell you what, I wouldn't take that from that cat though. If a cat picked me up by the scruff neck and put me out right on the doorstep, I'd go mental. I'd get rid of it. It is a saber tooth tiger though, Carl. So it could rip him to shreds. It's not like a normal domestic cat you have nowadays. You know when they go to the drive in at the beginning. Yeah. And they order maybe some ribs. Yeah. And it tips the car over. Yeah. Was that her first day on the job? Because. Yeah. It's never been ordered before. Yeah. She'd have realized, yeah, we're out of pig. We've got brontosaurus rib. Because. Knock the car over. No, it won't. I don't know, Rick, Can I tell. You now, that was an accident waiting to happen. It was really, wasn't it? Yeah. And it did. Oh, dear. Mind you, I had a. I went in tech to Texas once and I had some ribs and it was like the Flintstones. It was huge. And not only did it look too much like an animal that I couldn't actually eat it. I don't know who could eat it. I mean, seriously, it was two foot long. Yeah. And all the rib, it was like half a rib cage. And I just. Incredible. My Friends were. Lived in Texas for a while, and they. They once were in a diner, and there was, you know, those kind of benches that are attached to the table itself, like a kind of picnic bench. Yeah. And this huge fat guy came in. He wobbling. He ordered like this kind of everything you can eat meal. And his fat, kind of sort of, you know, kind of his big, fatty, fatty fat. And it's fatted on the fat table. It wrapped itself around the table. Everything. He was chowing down, and when he tried to leave, the table came up with him. Oh, no. Imagine that. I mean, they are fat, aren't they? They're big people. They're huge people. But it was that thing we talked about before, that bloke on Jerry Springer Stow. It was like 80 stone. Right now, I felt quite sorry for him. He was really sad and he was crying. It is rad. But my point is this, right when he got to say 50 stones, didn't he go, that's too much for. For a land animal. Exactly. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, that's. That's big, isn't it? I mean, I. I'm getting worried. I'm 13 stone and I'm genuinely getting worried. I'm thinking, oh, yeah. When you got that big. When you've actually got your own mare. Yeah, yeah. When you have time. When you have to get in helpers to. To what? What? Look what the scale says. Yeah. Like, they had four or five people lift up your belly and go, It's 52 stone. You go, that's too much. Exactly. That's. I'm gonna only have nine breakfasts today. When you begin to appear on the ordinance survey. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. When you've got your own symbol, it's like, we can see two things from space now. Fatty and Steve Merchant. We'll be landing right about. Well, no, I'm just saying freakish and big. Just another quick thought. Someone's mentioned Daphne from Scooby Doo. And I've. But I've always had a soft spot for Velma. Velma. I mean, I'd have. I'd have Clever. Can I tell you what would have happened if I was in that environment? I was maybe on the. Your glasses would have got tangled up. I'd have always had an art. I'd always be making a play for Daphne. Right. And I. Velma, would have fancied me. But I've always ignored it because I was playing for Daphne. And then when I finally realized it was never gonna happen with Daphne, I'd have Blown it with Velma. Maybe not though. Maybe not. Maybe not. Sometimes those, you know, they might, you know, appreciate honesty. Go. Listen, I've been hitting on the good looking one. Oi, four eyes. Yeah. Do you fancy it, Chubbs? Exactly. Something like that. Just being honest is what you're saying. I'm wondering. I don't mean to be libelous, but Velma, she was quite short. The glasses, the short hair lesbian. Hung around with the dog. Lesbian. I'm beginning to wonder if she was. See, unfortunately I said lesbian there. And you still carried on with your assessment of what it is to be a lesbian. It's bad enough doing the cliches of having short hair. You said the dog. Yeah, when she hangs around with a. Dog, the lesbians do that. Well, have you seen some lesbians? They're right dogs. Good night. Have you seen what I've done there? You know what I've done there, Rick. Comedy award winning. Professional. I was having a cup of tea. 100 reasons on XFM. 104.9. Just gone off to Ricky Gervais. Yeah. With Steve Merchant. Hi. All right, Rick, we've got a couple. Of emails in here and they're saying they enjoyed your performance over the Christmas period on a program called 100 Greatest TV Moments. Yeah, did you do an interview or something? What was the deal? I didn't see this. Yeah, the office was in there, wasn't it? And I interviewed for it. But what are they talking about? They enjoyed your performance. It's the thing that I did on Razzmatazz. Oh, is this where they found a clip? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, I was in a band and we had one single out or something and I did one TV appearance when I was about. Oh God. And I showed a bit of about 7 seconds. Me on Razzlematazz, for those that don't. Remember, was like a kind of, I suppose. What was it like a cd, UK of its time. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And. Oh God. And it was. It was that of the time. Sort of Neromantic. And they showed a clip of these. I looked about 10 and about 5 stone with hair and makeup and girly clothes. My sister actually said I look like Posh Spice. Which is a funny story about that because we were rushed and we had to do this thing and we. Oh God. And we're meant to take a flight to Newcastle and where were you traveling from? London. Yeah, but we got there, we didn't have tickets. We were told we there. But the A and R man overslept. The company overslept. And it was terrible. We were threatened and eventually it was too late to get the plane. We missed the plane. We had to get a train and it was really kind of fine. They were back and forth. They're going, yeah, if they come now, we can still do it. We're going to miss it. And this is like a big promotional thing. And we got there and they went, I. Oh, God. Right. And I had this sort of like jumpsuit I was wearing that I'd cut off, put that on backwards. A jumpsuit? Yeah, I had that on back to front and there was no time. And I think I even mimed wrong at one point and it was awful. But the funny story is this, that when we were there, we didn't have our tickets. This was at the airport. We bumped into Bucks Fizz, the guys and girls from Bucks Fizz, and their manager says, like, five of them, right? And there's two of us. And they had five tickets and Bucks Fizz tried to smuggle us through. So they went through the things, right, and they went, tickets, please. And he just waved five tickets that he had, like, that goes, this is us, right? And they went, well, can I have a look at them? There's only five here. And they went. They just looked at us and went, sorry, lads. We tried, we tried. We would try. We were nearly smuggled through by Bobby Carol. They couldn't even. Even with their powers. They were the height of their power. That was like. Was that really. That was. They'd already. Yeah, they'd already done. Making your mind up. I thought if anyone can get us through customs check, it was the phase. But even the Fizz that reassures me. I have to say, about kind of airplane travel, you know, these kind of troubled times. It's nice to know that even when someone like Bugs Fizz. Yeah. Couldn't get, you know, smuggle someone through. That's good because even, you know, the top security man went, hold on, there's five in the Fizz. There's five tickets. Those two lads are not going through. Exactly. That makes you more secure about air travel. Now. It's lovely if I'm in America, you know, and I see five star. Yeah. Trying to get through customs with two other. Exactly, exactly. I think. Wait a minute, what's going on there? Wait a minute. Security guy stopped him. It's fine, it's fine. Yeah. You know, there's only five in five star. Oh, it's lovely. It's lovely to know that. Yeah. I love the fact. And did you. Did you know the Fizz Previously. This was your first running with the Fizz? No, they were. They were doing. They were doing the Taz, same as they were doing the old Raz, same as us. Did you recognize the Fizz and go, my God, that's the Fizz. Let's try and sneak in with them. Or do they recognize you? How did it work? I wouldn't have recognized that. Exactly. That's what I'm thinking. Would you? I love the audacity of going up to Buck's face and saying, try and smuggle us in. Can you try and break aviation law for us now? Yeah. No, it's time to make your mind up. We're going to the land of make believe. I did that. And they love. They went. Brilliant, brilliant. We'll get you through, lads. Yeah, Just stay tight. I was actually on top of Bobby's shoulders in a long coat. Lovely. Yeah. But, Bill, seriously, though, I don't understand how. What their plan was like. They would have gone. Yep, through. It's the phase, Lamb. Through. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't bother checking the. We couldn't even get to Newcastle. Do you think he was wearing your jumpsuit backwards? That sort of gave it away. Well, no, but, see, I didn't have it on then. I was. I was just in series. I just had jeans and a T shirt then. I didn't even have my hair gelled. I was just like, cash. I saw it. I thought it looked all right. Did you? Did you? Well, I mean, for. Tight jumpsuit. Yeah. Cheekbones, brilliant. Yeah, Yeah, I had some cheekbones. Yeah. That was. That was if anyone else saw it or maybe they take it. Because I'd love to see it. I missed it. Well, I'll get you one. You have it. Put it. I'll tell you what, why not create a website and put that clip on there on a constant loop, and then send the address in and I'll give it out and people can check it out for themselves. Yeah, brilliant. Is that okay? Yeah. Cool. I have to lose weight now. Yeah, that film. Oh, now we come to the feature. We've. We're carrying this over 2002 because it was such a great success. Everyone's talking about it. I do remember I stopped my film reviews because I'm only doing films I like and I've done all the films I like. That's where other film reviewers fail. Sure. Because they review substandard films. My average is still nine and a half out of ten. Yeah. And no one's beaten that. Not Barry Norman, not Jonathan Ross. No one's Got an average of nine and a half out of ten for the films I reviewed. So I'm keeping it there. I don't want to drop my standards. However, that film sounds good. This is where I pick a classic track from a film that I might not have seen. Right. But I like the song. I might go and see the film. This is Almost Famous. The film was Almost Famous. I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it. Right, But a song. Now, don't panic. Listen without prejudice. This is out in John, but it's when he was good, okay? When he was a bright, funky young Brit glam star. Wonderful song, wonderful tune, wonderful lyrics. It's Tiny Dancer, Black Rebel, motorcycle club. There, Steve. What's about it? That's it, isn't it? We've had some laughs, haven't we? We've learned as well. We've been educated as ever. Yeah, past ears, all that. We've got baguette information. We've had features such as that film. Sounds good. Exactly. Song that I like. Song for the Lovers, Song for the Ladies. Song the Ladies coming up very shortly. Rick, I was lucky enough this week to go to a exclusive press preview of Britney Spears forthcoming movie Crisscross or Crossroads. Crossroads, I think it's called. Yeah, it's not related to the popular TV show. Right, Rick, I'm assuming you'd love me to do a little review of it now. I can't because it's embargoed until March. I can only talk about it in March, otherwise people will go crazy. No, I don't. I wouldn't want you to. Well, no, I imagine you want to know all about Crossroads because I cannot tell you anything. Well, don't then. I mean, just. You can ask me questions, you can pump me for information. I cannot tell you anything about it until March. I would pump you for no reason ever. No, but certainly not for information, Carl. Doesn't matter what you ask me about Britney Spears. Crossroads. I cannot tell you anything about it. Okay, okay. But seriously, if you want to know the plot or what I think of it, I cannot discuss it. Okay? If the listeners want to email in questions, they can. I cannot reply until March. So hang on for that. I've seen the film already. I've already seen the film myself in advance of everyone else. I can't tell anyone about it right until March. That's the kind of excuse. I'll tell you what, though. Maybe I'll review it in March. No, you can't. Why? Because you haven't seen it and I have. Yeah. If you want to ask me, ask me a question now about it. That's you in March. Yeah. But if you wanted to know now, you couldn't know. I wouldn't be able to tell you. Right. Song for the Lovers. Yeah. Ladies. Sorry? Song for the ladies. This week I was lucky enough to get given as a Christmas gift, the Rolling Stones complete Singles Collection. Good present. Well, that is an absolute joy. And I was. I'd forgotten how brilliant Wild Horse is. Is. Oh, great track from the Stone. So I thought I'd play that this week for the ladies. Let's leave them with that. Jagger and Richards at their best. Beautiful. Watts is in on it. Wattsy. I mean, Wyman was still there those days. See you next time. Bye.",
