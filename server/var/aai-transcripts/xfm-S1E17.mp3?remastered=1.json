  "text": "Our freaks, Electric Richard Atkins, Sugar Babes and XFM 104.9. Steve? Absolutely. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant. Hello. Carl, the. The Producer. Seven minutes past one of a Saturday and what a lovely Saturday it is. It is indeed. By. Well, it looks nice and bright, but it's deceptive because I went out and I just had a T shirt on and I had my jumper on. Me. I got out there and I thought, this is chilly. I had to pop the jumper on. Oh, no. So, you know, just be good. If you're just, you know, looking at the win, thinking, I'll go outside, pop a jumper on or. Or a jacket, because it looks nice, but it is a little bit colder than it looks. Rick, can I ask, were you wearing the jumper around your waist, tied with a knot, or did you have it over your shoulders like maybe she just jumped off a yacht? I popped it round my waist and I'll tell you why. I tucked my T shirt in for neatness and comfort. Lovely. But I know even I know that's a little bit dorky. So I was trying to hide the belt line. Okay. Okay. So then I popped the jumper on. Didn't have to worry about it. So nice. Go with the double knot. I didn't. I. Because I can loosen if you're not careful. Especially if you're carrying bags or you're busy on the tube. I know, but I wouldn't mind that as long as I didn't lose it. As long as I saw it loosen and fall. I pick it up and then devastating. And then clean it. Not in the washing machine, though. Just. I pop it in a cold soak. Okay. And then leave it out on a few towels or something. Or pop it over the radiator. So what's the problem with putting it in a hot wash? Well, it can cause shrinkage. Oh, no. So coming up, we've got loads of tunes. We're going to be playing them. Some of the best bands around. Some. Some new ones, some old ones. Might even play some Adamant. We don't yet. Let's have a Badly Drawn Boy, though, shall we? Come on. Current single. Badly Drawn Boy there. Silent Sigh. Is that the one with the duck? Yeah. Apparently he stopped wearing his hat around because he keeps getting recognized and he's going to not wear his hat when he doesn't want to get recognized. Okay. Maybe pop it in the wash. I mean, be careful. Let's just have a kind of a light cold rinse. Yeah, Light cold rinse. Soak it. It Right. Because it's woolen. Right. And then just leave it out on a towel or, you know, maybe in, you know, near the immersion heater. Sure. Or over a radiator. Or even the radiator. Is that problem. It can cause that sort of, you know, damaging to the fibers of the wall. He had a kid last week. Did he? Yeah. Who did? Badly Drawn Boy. All right. Okay. Badly draw a little boy. He's gonna call it Brilliant Rick. Yeah. Well Done is a sort of satire. I'd like to see that as a headline. Deliver your money all your life. Oh, now. Can we explain why that's funny? Don't panic, Carl. I'm a professional. Don't worry. What's your concern, Carl? What's your concern? Nothing. Tell us. No, you can say. You can't. You can. This is so unprofessional. It's. What? What? What have we done? What? Talking about wool. Come on, Carl. What's the problem? What's the problem? You say he's great and he's so scared. Come on, Carl. What's. Tell us. I don't know all the ins and outs, so I don't want to get into it. What? The thing. You can't. People are perplexed now. What's the. What's the thing, Carl? What's the thing? What are you worried about? Is it an email that's been received by the head of. You've got the email open. You can talk about. You can say. Okay. I don't understand it. Please note that under. Under a ruling at the Old Bailey, any reference to adamant state of mental illness in any news report will constitute a breach of the ruling and therefore lead to serious action from his lawyers. That's right. And that's true. We can't. We can't talk about that. You can play his records and sing his classic songs. Sing songs? Yeah. It's best just to leave it. Yeah, that's what we. Yeah. Carl was a little bit worried. There's no way I was gonna mention that or influence anything. And I totally agree with the law, so don't panic. That should have never been sent to you. Why? Because it's like, you know, accidents happen when things like that happen. Right. You know, you've been told not to mention it. Yeah. And you're like a little kid. Yeah. And. And once things are in your head. Yeah. It's difficult not to mention it. I mean, when. When I was a kid. Yeah. Right. Me mom's sister Hazel. Right. Was seeing another bloke. It's weird. Because she's a lesbian now. Must have been an interesting Christmas. But anyway. But anyway, I've seen this bloke and it looked like Ken Dodd. Apparently he looked like Ken Dodd. Looked like Ken Dodd. So people said, don't mention it because it gets. It gets on his nerves when you. When you, like, meet him and you go, oh, God, you look like Ken Dodd. So I said, all right, his name is Will or whatever. And I was introduced to him first thing. I said, nice to meet you, Ken. Did he do it as a joke or did he. No, no, because, you know, when. You know, I'm not allowed to say that. Yeah, I mustn't say that. Can't. And then I saw him. I thought Jes came out. Was it Doddy who turned her into a lesbo, do you think? Well, he wasn't a good looking bloke. So possibly she started going out with Esther Ransom, though, which is. Which is weird. Out of the frying party. How did she announce that to everyone? What age was she when she realized. Well, I mean, we're not a close family. Do you know what I mean? We're not a family who keeps in touch with everyone. And I think my mom called her up one Christmas and sort of said, you know, how's the Diddy man? Yeah. And she said, oh, no, I'm not. I don't do that anymore. I'm knocking about with Sandra or whatever, right? It's like, all right, not big, butch. Sandra with a big earrings and a skinhead. Used to live down the road from you. I don't know. I used to get Doc Martens wholesale. That's Sandra. But. But she lived. She had a haunted house. Go on. Who? Sandra? No, Azel. Right, this is this before she was a lesbian or not before. Okay. And there was a bike in the hall and the pedals used to go back. There was a what? In the hole. That's Andy in it. Oh, that's great. Don't worry, we won't do anything. So sorry. No, there was. I want to know about the haunted house. There was a bike in the hall. There's a bike in the hall. And the pedals used to go backwards on their own. And also shoes used to stick to the wall or something. Did they? Yeah, yeah. Shoes used to stick to the wall. Yeah. Okay. That sounds like a. That's only possible. Yeah. Oh, dear. Brilliant. Maybe she should clean the walls. There she goes. The Lars. And there she goes. What a great start to a show. We've had. We've had 20 minutes of some of the. The best banter, chatter and music and anecdote anywhere on the dial. You're damn right. High five. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, what are we talking about? Oh, wow. I love that track. It's lovely. They've got a bit of the. The Liverpool gene pool, haven't they? That sort of doddy, you know. I mean, I like the Scouse sort of look, you know, the Siller Black and the Stan Boardman. Yeah. Particularly it's Liverpool. It's sort of happy in teeth and ears and. Happy in teeth and ears, yeah. Oh, brilliant description. Yeah. Happy and teeth and ears. Yeah. That's just three of my friends now. We've got a great track lined up, haven't we, Carl? That I've bought in. So I'm going to Gar. Now, I'm not ashamed, as you know. Me and Steve aren't worried about being part of a trend or, or, you know, being trendy or jumping on. But Steve particularly doesn't worry about like looking good or. No, no, I'm saying he doesn't worry about walking along like that or, you know, I'm looking good. No, no, no, I'm saying you don't mind the insults. Freak boy or goggle eye or sw. You know what I mean? Or, or a new phrase that's been coined because of Steve's face. Water for frog's back. Who's saying that? Just a lot of. A lot of you. A lot of friends and that. But I mean, my friends. Yeah, A lot of. A lot of the people. Can you name names or. I, I can't really make promises. You can. I. I can't. I can't. I think it's. The Kagal. Looks good. It does look. It's waterproof, Rick. And it's also stylish. I wear nothing underneath, so it's tight to the skin. It gets sticky. Is that why you sort of rustle? But what, so what's, what's all the. Is there abuse? What's this? No, no, they just say because I'm pretty trendy guy. But I, as you say, I cut my own trend. You know, I make my own style. You know that. Consequently the pipe. You don't feel that's an affectation? I. I don't think. I think because you're young and tall. Yeah. The pipe looks a little bit silly. Go on. I mean, I know you're. You're worried about because. Because we've already lost the trilby. Well, I'm worried because pipes are going to die out. I mean, this Is the problem that there's no young people now who are taking up the pipe as a smoking device? Is there anyone. Is there anyone under the age of. What should we say? We've said this 24, and I don't think there was no one. I think there was some nutty old woman who phoned in and said, I smoke a pipe. But I'm talking about, you know, because if years ago it was like an Oxbridge student, you know, you'd be at Cambridge or something, you'd have a lovely pipe, you know, tweed suit, you'd be there studying. That was, you know, and that was. The young gen always smoked a pipe. But no one is now. I'll tell you this. In the year 2050, there'll be no pipes. They won't exist. Well, I think all. All drugs, like nicotine and alcohol will be banned. And we won't. We won't be allowed to think our own thoughts. We'll have to live in the sewers, like eating rat burgers, won't we? Yeah, and then we'll have to download our memories or something. Oh, God, I'll be a rebel Rick. I'll just go down there listening to jazz. No, you won't. You'll just have a little chip in the back and you'll be. You'll be going out with a big fat man with a big toe Gron. And it'll be. And you'll be. You'll be touching him, but, well, I. Think he's a beautiful woman. And I'll be fighting with the. The rebel underground. No, you won't. I will. No, I will you dead when I. You'll be dead. Yeah, I'll be dead. Yeah, in 2050, you will. I'll be dead. Unless you. Because obviously you're becoming quite wealthy now. You're becoming a very rich man, obviously from all your, you know, celebrity br. Have my brain put into a robot made of titanium and I love it. Oh, would you be cryogenically frozen if you could do it? I would, but I'd leave myself out on a towel. Right. Never. Because if you do it too quickly, there is shrinkage. Did you read in the paper this week this is true. Apparently the. The world's oldest man, who's 113, lives in some little part of Japan, like little island in Japan. But apparently the world's oldest woman also lives in exactly the same place. Now, I don't know if she's since died, but she lived in the same place as well. Do you not think there's something Suspicious going on there. I mean, isn't that a bit eerie? I'm thinking, have you ever seen them together? And has he ever found lipstick in his bag? I think that'll be one of the same. I wonder if it's something like, you know, what brought Godzilla back? There's some kind of. There's some antics over there. No, there might be. They're sort of like. Yeah. Although just hearing some of Carl's stories about Skull, there's somewhat going on there where he lives. Yeah. Did you say you did live near a sort of nuclear plant or something? I found out it wasn't a nuclear plant. A chemical plant. My God. Really? And is that. Is that really true? What color was the tap water in your area? It was better than it is in London. I was talking to someone about this the other day. Yeah, Water in London is ropey. And. And I use one of them water filters. Do you really? And the guy down in the office was saying it's a waste of time, though, because they only work for a couple of waters. Like, you fill your jug twice and then the water's going through the same muck, isn't it? That's true enough, but it's not. If it's not getting through, it's not getting through. No. If it's a filter, it doesn't matter, does it? Still not good, though. Fair enough. Yeah, good point. So just. Are you just throwing it away based on what that bloke said? Did he say. Did he sell you another one that. He had on him, a better updated model? Yeah. Did he have a suit? When you say, like, he works here, was he actually hanging around outside? Yeah. Did he have a suitcase with a Glock of these in? Yeah, yeah. So just go back to insults briefly. Go on. You know. See, that's goofy. That's. No, no, no, no, because that's. That's what he said. It's in my head. What do you mean he said no. Did he say that? No, I mean, when did you call me goofy? No, he didn't. He said about balding head. Come on, come off it. Who's calling me goofy? I'm not even goofy. Goggle lights. Fair enough. You can sort your ankle. I can't. What do you mean? I can. How could I sort my. Look at. I'm not even goofy. That's not fair. You've got the property of features. What? Just needs sorting out a bit. I can't help it if. If my hair is not good. I noticed the other day when Carl was sitting on Your knee having this picture taken. It's a long story. Right. He's got a completely spherical head. It's slightly too small. I'm not being funny, because, I mean, you know what? I'm not perfect, but he's got a completely spherical little head. He looks a little bit like a baby hamburger. You know, hamburger off McDonald's. He looks like a little baby Hamburglar. And it's sort of quite put upon. It's. Suzanne thinks I look like that thing in that Dulux advert. You know, when the woman pulls the head off that. That little plasticine morph type and then. They make a new ad for it and it's like a little ad, really. That's your girlfriend saying it. I know. Anyway, listen, let's. Let's get back to business here. This is a great track. It's America by Simon Agarthunkle. This is where I started saying we don't care about being trendy and all that. That was it. Strokes last night. XFM 104.9. We're flying now, 35 minutes into it. No real. No real hiccups. I don't think that so far it's going really well. My name is Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve. Hello there, Carl. All right. Coming up soon. White van, man. White van, Carl. We ask Carl the questions that the sun asks someone else. Exactly. It's a good feature. It's a great feature. I'll be testing Carl and the new. The. The new re. Education of car. As you know, you got a GCSE in history. It was the last heavy sort of one. Yeah. No, so. Winston Churchill. Yeah, because we've got. You got. We're going on to more sort of metaphorical and metaphysical sort of pursuits, aren't we? Not that book. Yeah, that's the east upset. I can't read that in a week. You don't have to read it, just choose out. Just choose the ones about the foxes eating penguins. You'll like that. Steve, over to you. Thanks very much. I wonder if. I don't think we've made much progress yet on sending Carl into sort of into the air with the. No, this has gone a bit ballistic. Go off the idea. Oh, no. Shut up. No, don't. You haven't got that idea. We've inflamed the imagination of the Capitol. There's people offering left, right and center and I think it's a good idea, but I think we should, you know, make a day of it. I think we should send you up in some balloons. Right. Maybe, you know. Well, hang on. Before we carry on, let's explain what happened because people might not have listened last week. I don't believe that there are one or two, Rick. I don't believe that people who are. Nailed maybe out of the country. Okay. Yeah. So last week we discovered. Was it that 623. Is it 6,000? No, I read that 6,000 balloons filled with helium can lift a bloke off the floor. I think that's too many. I think that's too many. I think we could do it for less, certainly. Well, anyway, listen, there are various organizations which actually exist already that can provide this kind of entertainment, this kind of fun. I mean, I didn't realize there was a whole kind of market for this already, but apparently. I know. Incredible. Anyway, so we're going to try and track one of them down. We're going to see if they can. They can organize it so that you, Kyle, can float into the air. We need to get you. Is it at least 11ft up? Yeah, if it's, I think certainly higher. I mean, I can't remember what the record is, but it's quite a long way. 11,000. 11,000Ft. Yeah, but I think they're all official. I want to do it with like little. Those little balloons you get for a quid at the zoo. I don't think that can be right, health and safety wise. I don't think that can be healthy. I think if we get him to sign some out, which I will. Okay, I think we'll cover ourselves. But yeah, certainly we're thinking of maybe making it a bit like. Is it T in the Park? The Capital fm. Yeah, the big event. You get sort of steps. At least H from steps can come down and host the event. I mean, I don't mind comparing it. Steve's gonna do. Steve's learning to sort of like scratch and mix and beat match and I mean, you're getting pretty. I'm making a lot of progress. Yeah. You are going to be a turntable lister. Yeah. Steve never learned an instrument which he regrets, you know, and you know, he's a modern lad and he's. He's using turntables as his instrument. I just got two turntables on the microphone and so far, I mean, that's seriously. I'm cutting up big style. No, don't, don't laugh because it is mental. That's the kind of stuff I'm coming out with. And I'm scratching. I've got, I've got the beats, you know, matching. Can you imagine that. Shut up, it's up. No, no. Look at the Chemical Brothers, for goodness sake. If you're talking about freaks, look at those weirdos. Man alive. At least you cut your hair at Gavin. You know that, whatever it's called, they used to kind of at least faintly appear in their videos. So this one is just some shots of, like, what you see from outside a train. That is, to them, that is more glamorous and exciting, apparently, than seeing the lads themselves in the video. Who do you think's cooler to look at, Steve or the Chemical Brothers? Steve, definitely. Yes, you're absolutely right, Carl. And that's the first sensible thing you've said for a long time. I was to work with Steve on. On some music. Yeah. If he had the choice, I think Steve would look better on a album cover. Really? Yeah. What would you do? Would you change him at all to. What would you do with his image? I put him in the distance. I can't believe this is. No, just so you don't look as tall. That's doing you a favor. You know, I was on the. This is true. I was on the. On the tube, right, coming in to meet Gervais the other day, and I was wearing a suit and my mobile phone slipped out my pocket and it landed on the seat. And I didn't realize this, and as I was about to get off, some bloke who was sat there like an old guy, he picked up the phone, he went, oi, lanky, you dropped your mobile phone. And I was like, well, I. Thank you for pointing out I dropped my phone. But did you have to do the lanky? But you knew he meant. I bet you turned around straight away. It worked. Yeah, he's done you again. But I was the only person stood up. It was a fairly empty train. Was it? Was there any other lanky people there? No. Well, then, no. But my point was there was no one else at all who was about to exit the train. Okay, so we didn't need lanky. He could have gone, excuse me, sir, or oyu, Anything but oy, lanky. I know. It's that thing, though, isn't it? That's what I'm talking about. You say the thing that you don't want to say. It's like me with Ken Dodd and Will. I think he wanted to say this. Oh, well, I think he took pleasure in it. I think he went, that blokes lanky. I shouldn't say that. Yeah, I should. Oh, you're lanky. What's he gonna do? Yeah. Do you want your phone back or not? Well, this balloon thing, anyway, it's got a bit out of hand. Why is it out of hand? That's funny. I just wanna. I want, you know, I want to sort of like tie them all to the back of your belt so as you go up there, you sort of tip forward slightly so you're going up slightly upside down. We could paint some advertising on your bald head. On your. Yeah. Oh, that'd be great. Yeah, we'll do that, Lanky. That'd be great. No, I mean last week it was just a bit of fun about going, like just lifting my feet off the ground. No. And that's a big difference to what it's got now. No. Okay, well, I'll tell you what we'll do. 100ft in the air and we're. And I'll hold on to the rope. But we'll do it at Wembley Arena. We'll sell tickets. But it'll be for charity, Carl. It'll be for charity. Now. We'll have lots of underprivileged kids coming along to see it. You know, it's like, you know, I like karaoke, but I wouldn't want to go on Stars in the Rise. Sure. And it's. It's got out of hand. That's how it's sort of. It's grown too big. I don't. Who would you do if you're on Stars in the Eyes? I do that Moby. Now that Jack the Knife song. Jack the Knife, Old Mackeys. See that one? Yeah. Is Mac the Knife. That's what I do. But which. You do a hip hop version. But which of the many singers would you impersonate? You can't. It's not the song, is it? It's the singer. You could do Jimmy Somerville, I think, quite well. Yeah. Somerville. Moby. Did Morph bring out a single? I don't think Morph did. Didn't he? No, I'm not sure. Didn't he have a theme tune? Did Morph phone in? If you think more. Morph didn't speak. Rick let him sing Morph to. Hardly had any features. True. Right. He's just decided to play a record. Something's taken over the show. Express 2, featuring David Byrne. Lazy XFM 104.9, quarter to two. I'm Ricky Gervais. Steve's got the son. Yes. We're just going to be doing White Van Carl, where we ask Carl the questions. The sun asked some other bloke. That's right. Because we think Carl's got more to say than anyone on anything. Carl only tells the truth, by the way. Just remember that, listeners, off you go. Yes, well, today's white van man in the sun is John Slade. He owns his own door maintenance company. He's. His answers are very informative, I have to say. But Carl, what do you make of the Channel 4 producer aged 30 who duped a school into believing he was a teenager for a documentary? Are you familiar with this story? No, go on. Well, basically a 30 year old guy kind of fooled the school into. Into thinking he was a pupil for a secret documentary. The school's outraged. Do you think that that's, you know, for you? You know, should anything go when it comes to making tv? I think I've said to you before, there's loads of kids at my school, I remember being in the first year and kids who. What did, what year do skills go up to? I was in the first year. What, what is it? 11? 5. Oh, sorry, first year of infants and juniors. No, secondary school. 11. Right, year 11 kids. No beards. No, not year 11. They're 11 when they first go to school. Right. Well, I'm 11. The kids at the air, at the older. Well, there's a four and then there's a leave when. You can leave when you're 16, I think, can't you now? Right, well, kids who were 16. Yeah. Looked old. They had, they did have beards. I remember going there and thinking some of them were teachers. I think he's answered that next one. What's the next one? Tattoos and everything. Kids in the, in the earlier years even. What do you make of the fact that Mariah Carey's 38 million pound payoff has cost EMI staff their jobs and we're talking 1800 EMI staff who have lost their jobs. Yeah, I mean, I mean, is that silly money? Mariah Carey on 38 million. She doesn't need that much. She doesn't need that much. She has to dress nice though. It's not her fault. I'd say it's bad business because emi, did you say? Yes. Right. They've got rid of them. Them staff. Mariah Carey's left. Who's going to do the work. Should come back and do some temping. Well, they should have, they should have got a loan and paid her. Yeah. I mean, vicious circle that. Right. Have you, have you done. You have done a business degree, have you? Yes. You did commerce. Where do you do that? What did you do that school. I'd learned how to fill Out a check, pay a bill. And I think I had a trip around Kellogg's. Did you. Did you get. Did you get an O level? We know he didn't, but. Was there a commerce exam or was it just a division of maths? What? Did he fill out a check? Subset of maths. It was an option. It was like, if you want to do it. What was it? A check, pay a bill, Pay a bill, have a visit right now. Kellogg's. And I saw my sister's boyfriend there at the time. He sorted me out with some variety packs. Really? What was in them? You know, Rice Krispies and good stuff. Space dust or whatever it is. Space. So sorry, that wasn't Ken Dodd, though. That was someone else. Was. That was an aunt. Yeah. That wasn't Special K. Oh, dear. What about this, then? Home Secretary David Blunkett admits that muggers rule some streets. Weird, this, because when I was out with you. I don't believe it's going to be weird, whatever you say. When we were in that pub that night and we got talking about muggers and that, the tip is what I tend to do because I nearly got mugged once. You what? You nearly got mugged once? I nearly got mugged, yeah. But. But I tried this technique of acting a bit mental. Right. And how did you act mental? Well, this guy wanted me trainers and I was in Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester. It was quite late one night and he come off, he said, I want them trainers. I said, you want them? I said, I worked hard for these, so how dare you come to me asking. And I got a bit livid. He looked at me like, oh, my God, he's got a right one here. And he left me. Were you acting mental or were you just mental? No, I put it on a bit. Were you not petrified, though? Well, you don't think about it, do you, when you're sort of in the eyes of danger? Well, not you, clearly. You're a brave man. So what did you say? I just. I just went. I just went a bit mad. I just kind of. Because he said he wanted the trainers and that they were dear ones at the time and I just know you're not having these, so I've crafted you. I said, I wanted these trainers. Yeah. And, you know, went on to tell him how I work at printers and I don't enjoy it and, you know, I put in all these hours and that and I have to cycle home for about five miles and. Did he give you his trainers? Yeah. Did he have a knife? I Just left. No, I didn't get that. Didn't get that violent. Well, that's very brave of you, Carl. Yeah, it's good. Good advice, though. Just that mental. See, what's it should. He tried it the other night. Oh. Liza Minnelli. Yeah. She says, oh, well, I've worked hard for these diamonds. Yeah. It's not easy being the daughter of Judy Garland. You don't know what it's like. Finally, apparently there was a crook that got a job, a security job at Heathrow. Right. He was a crook and he got a job at Heathrow as robbers steal another £2 million. Apparently security down there is lax. Yeah. Is that concern for you? Is this another. Yeah. Two million? Yeah. Why. Why is all this money at the airport? It's those sandwich shops, you know, they're really expensive, the sandwiches. In, like, when you're playing, they're like eight pound fifty for tuna. Which is ludicrous. Yeah, that's basically the reason. What do you mean? Why is all this money at airports? What? What is it doing there? Why? Have a go. Have a go. No, I have a go. Answering this yourself? Why is anything at an airport? It's going somewhere or coming in from somewhere. Yeah. But money, you can sort it out through the bank, like phone banks and that. Have you done commerce? You know a lot about paying bills and writing out checks. Yeah. Tell us about Kellogg's. What was it like? What was in the factory? Was it just like squashing bits of corn? Pretty boring, really. Just loads of conveyor belts, boxes of corn flakes everywhere. Just what you imagine. Yeah. So is it more? This is where you might be working? This is where you're likely to work? Possibly. There was two trips. There was that and the trip to Manchester. Even news. Okay. And I. I left that early because I had a job in Cordon Blue. Kellogg's. What's that? It's like a supermarket. Yeah. And I. I had to leave the trip early and the teacher went mad, saying they thought I'd got lost on the. You know, in the building and stuff. No, because it was like day two of working in this supermarket and I couldn't be late. I thought, by the time I explain where I've got to go and everything, I'll be even later. Sure. So I just left and then apparently they were searching the building and everything for me. Stuck in a printer. What was the printer's name? You worked at a supermarket called Cordon Blue? Yeah. That's great, isn't it? It's rubbish. Oh, got sacked. What'd you get sacked for messing about in a. But back in the. In the car park around the back. Yeah, Right. There was. There was a grid and all the concrete had gone funny. So when it rains, you got like a big lake. Oh, yeah, right. And I got in. Do you know those big metal trolleys you get to, like, put all the food in? Oh, yeah. I got in one of them and pushed myself out into this lake of cement, no water. And I got stuck in the middle, right. And the boss was like, where's. Where's Carl? He's meant to be doing, you know, facing up the beans. So someone said, oh, I saw him messing about out the back. He came out and saw me stuck in the middle of this lake in a trolley and he said, get back in. Would you say, no, I'm filming sharks. I said, it's too deep, I can't get out. You'll have to pass me something. And he said, I'm not passing you nothing. He said, you can get out of there and walk through it. I said, I'm not. I've got my trainers on. Probably the same one. Yeah. You've risked your life for them. Yeah. I said, I'm not getting these wet. I said, what are you going to do? I said, I'm going to wait for the water to go down the grid. He said, the grid's blocked now. Get out or you're sacked. I said, well, I'm not getting out. He said, right, you're sacked. So. So you were sacked. How long did you have to wait for the water to go down the grid? At the end, I did get bored and I sort of did a bit of a leap and a jump and got one foot wet. How long were you waiting? About half an hour. Just think of it. Just think. I mean, how did he get himself into that situation? That's fantastic. Should we play records? Oh, definitely, definitely. That's a joy. Oh, you're an absolute pleasure. More White Van man next time on the show. Electric Soft Parade. I keep trying to get the album for free from you car. You've not sorted me out yet. I have to rely on other people to give me different comments. I did try it. I'll keep trying. Please do. This is one called There's a Silence Electric Software. Gomez and shot shot on XFM 101.9. Sorry, I was going to tell Steve something. Talk amongst yourselves. When you were out there, Johnny Mango phoned up and said to Carl, come on, when are we going to do this thing? And Carl got all nervous, right and he went, you don't want to do it do. He went. He said, well, I just. It's going to get out of hand. I just wanted to go as high as a tree. And he went, well, you. Can we just. I'll hold you down with a rope. He went, yeah, but he said, but when the crowd are there and they're all screaming higher, higher, I'll of pressure and have to go along with it. What crowd? What crowd? Higher. No, higher. You don't live in like a medieval era. It's not going to be dancing bears and tumbling midgets. I don't know. That's an idea. Hold on. If there's anyone got any of those. Some midgets would be amazing. Yeah, definitely less balloons, cheaper to do. Oh, you're going. No, you're going up with them. No, you're going up with. Not just. No, under either army. Brilliant. Yeah. Oh, dear. It's time for your. At the re Education of Carl Pilkington this week, Carl was studying the life and times of Winston Churchill. What do you make of it, Carl? What. What did Churchill do for you? Well, last week I made a bit of an error with Hitler. Yeah. I remember too much and it just. It was way too much for me. Sure. So what I've done this week, sort of flick through, got a few of them basic facts. Yeah. And what I've learned. Right. Bit weird the way all these people have something in common, that they're all a bit weird when. When the younger. Okay. They've gone. Well, you know, Rasputin, he wasn't well as a kid. Yeah. Otherwise this is Rasputin, the mad monk wasn't well. Yeah. Yeah. Che Guevara. Asthma. Asthma. Really bad asthma. Hitler, he was only one boy. Mental. Yeah. His mother, he was a bit mental. That could be labelers. Yeah. And if we don't. Churchill. Yeah. Very weak child. Was he? He only spoke to his dad four times in his old lifetime. Really? Yeah. Didn't get on with his dad and I think one of the times when his dad spoke to him, he was having a go saying he didn't do as well in the army as he wanted him to. Right. So that's. That's pretty sad bit. I picked up it. Yeah. Yeah. So that spurred him on anyway. Yeah. I'm not going in all ins and outs. Very, very important bloke. Okay. No, seriously. I mean, your dad bought the tapes, didn't he? Yes. And I can understand why, because he did. He did change a lot for us. I mean, we won't be sat here now talking like this. Why? We could have been German. Yep. He didn't let that happen. No. Everyone had a go at him. Right. When it. When it. When like. I think it was Chamberlain who was in power. Yeah. And he was like saying, don't be trusting that Hitler. Yeah. You know, and everyone was like, look, stop causing trouble. Chamberlain sorted it out, you know, he sorted out a peace agreement. Yeah. And he was like, no, I don't trust him. And everyone's like, oh, you know, you're just causing trouble. You know, everyone else is happy. Then it turned out that Hitler did actually do the dirty. Yeah. And try and come over. I remember. Didn't he do something? He started a war. There was a conflict of something. Yeah. Yeah. I started a problem and everyone went, hang on a minute. That Churchill knew what he was talking about. Yeah. Get him back in charge. Sure. And they got him in and Hitler was scared of him because he knew that he wasn't going to be having any lies or anything. He couldn't try it on with Churchill. Yeah. Especially when he was a little bit pissed up and coked and with a big cigar. Churchill. He wasn't that. He wasn't doing that. I think. I think a lot were during the war in the war cabinet. I think that things to keep him awake all night and stuff. And he certainly liked a brandy Rick. Winston Churchill was coked up. Was he? I mean, sorry, this is something I wasn't aware of. If there are any historians listening, if I'm wrong, I'm world at war. No. Any historians or, you know, experts on. On war. Did. Did church or not. Not some of the. The other people during I think the first and Second World War take a little bit of cocaine. So when he said that doctors certainly used to Hitler like cakes. Would they be like the funny sort of cakes? No, he probably did like a little bit of Madeira cake. All right. Yeah. That's probably nothing. Sorry, carry on. So anyway, you beat the bosch. Yeah, did all that. Steady on. His personal life's nothing to do with it. And the most amazing bit is, right, he wasn't. It wasn't fit and he had a couple. He's a good looking bloke in many ways. He had a couple of strokes, but he had a stroke on saying. We've had that. He beat the bosch. He liked to have a couple of strokes. Let's not get into innuendo, Carl. It's stupid. Right, say he had like a stroke on a Tuesday. He was. He was up and fighting again. On a Wednesday. Really. He was a strong bloke. Yeah. And then he died at about the age of 86 or something. Okay. He's good lad, wasn't he? He was really good, yeah. Is he, is he the one you, you favor most of all? Say out of all. I mean, Rasputin. I don't understand why he got. Like I said, I don't know why they made a book on him. No, no. It just didn't deserve it. No, no. Che Guevara, you know, he had his. He had his time, suppose and did a bit, did a bit good for certain people. Sorted Cuba out. It doesn't really affect me. No, no. Hitler. I mean. Enough said. Yeah. Bad bloke. Churchill sorted it all out. Yeah. And like. So your favorite out of the four of them, the. The of all those four is Churchill. Yeah. Brilliant, brilliant. I, I agree, I agree with you. I think what I love with, with. Your kind of sort of summary of these people's incredible lives is the way that it's almost like I remember in looking magazine. I don't remember looking. It was the Junior TV Times. They used to have half a page which was a comic strip. Yeah. Summarizing someone's life. You might have say five Star. The story of five stars. And he'd have a picture. I always remember the Roger Moore one was a picture of like Roger's parents. Like Roger Moore was born in 1930. Picture of Roger's parents. Roger grew up during the war. Picture of Roger running down the street, right. Just as a school kid with a Spitfire coming behind him like he was going to try and shoot him. Mr. Smith, surely. Exactly, exactly, yeah. Roger took up acting. Picture of Roger like acting. Roger became James Bond. James Bond. Roger is now a popular, you know, star in his own right. And there's a lot of work for charity. Brilliant. He summed up the whole thing and kind of. I think they used to have that in one of the TV times or the cinema. I remember when it was Tina Turner, what a born Sarah May Bullock. Then it was Nut Bush City Limit. Stop Hitting me Ike. And then simply the best. And that was it. That's pretty much what the. How your summary of. Of great, great events is. I'd say if you didn't know about Churchill, you've learned a bit today. Can any. Can people call in the. The. All these, all these fellas taking cocaine. I think I'm right. It's O8 700, 800 1234. Yeah, give us a call. XFM 104.9 Did Winston Churchill and various. Other dignitaries take coke during the war? During the war. Staying up for the war effort, but emergency summits and meetings, I, I think it was, I think it's been documented. I could be wrong. And let me tell you now, it's not happening today. Wow, Pete Yawn there. He's there, isn't he? To save me for Nancy. XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Delay is with me, Steve Merchant. I'm getting excited now because we've had loads of calls and emails not only backing me up, but going a little bit further. Apparently Johnny Mango called in again. He's our, he's become our sort of official researcher on that, on this show that there is evidence that Queen Victoria in Balmoral with a young house guest, Winston Churchill, used to consume cocaine filled lozenges. So there you go. Also, MDMA was a precursor, sort of Ecstasy, a derivative. And that was big in the day, giving soldiers, you know, a little pick me up. So it's not so mad, is it? Because he was into his speeches and that and they say that coke gives you sort of, you know, the balls to stand up and, and say, like. Not that that's a good thing. No, it's not. No, Definitely not. No. Right. But it apparently, it gives you, it gives you, it makes you confident on it. So you can stand up and say, you know, we're gonna fight him on the beaches. Yeah. And all that. And sound like you mean it. Exactly. Yeah. When he was sort of like, you know, a little bit pissed up with his cicar on, coked off his tits. He wanted to fight. He didn't care where it was. He'd fight on a beach. He didn't care. He didn't care if he got sand in his news trainers. He was boozed up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You want to fight. Yeah. That's why he was coming hard. He was very much. You've got to think of him as the Liam Gallagher of his day. Yeah. Oh, dear. Are we allowed to talk about this? I mean, I don't mean in terms of referencing drugs, but are we allowed to. Is this like, libelous to Winston Churchill? One, you can't lie with the dead. Two, it's. Is that only in America? I'm asking and we're not saying, you know. Two, I think you're probably gonna do. Also a fair, fair comment. Three, we say we were joking. Four, it's a satire. Yeah. Five, we love him. Five, we're not, we're not condoning drugs in any way. Six, this is O'Leary show. I didn't have a go at him anyway. I said, he's all right. There's any law against Rasputin, we might be in trouble. You did willfully, Raspute. Yeah. All over the swag on off Russia's greatest love machine. Yeah. Yeah. You didn't shoot him till he was dead, did you? Oh, oh. Put some poison into him. I'll tell you this, if there's any other historical questions that people want answered, then we're the men. Because really, with the three of us, our knowledge of the fact that the Hindenburg was filled with helium. Yeah. The. The kind of coke habits and various drug habits of. Of Britain's most famous political leader. Yeah, we've got the answers to all of it, Einstein. Go on. I found out in the week that he. He didn't talk till he was six. See, it's all. It's all these people who are weird. Churchill couldn't read, could he, till he was about 8 or 9. Really? Yeah. So there you go. He had. He got a D in history, apparently. Gcse. Just one better. No, but Carl called me in the week and he was a little bit stressed because he's had a couple of. He's had a bad week now. He got stressed about Hitler and, and Churchill. And I said, well, we're. We're chilled out a little bit and I'll teach him something a little bit cozier. And I said, like, what about animals? No, you know, not frightening other animals. You're interested in animals, aren't you? You know, and. And he went, all right then. All right then. And then he went, okay, here's a question for you, Heather. So there's. There's three animals without ears. He said, and I've told you one. And I went, well, that's the snake. Because he was talking about the snake. I went. I went, hold on, Carl, there's loads of animals without ears. He went, there's not. There's three. I went, there's loads. I said, jellyfish, worms, single cell protozoa peripherus. But he went, oh, what are you talking about? What are you talking about? Animals. Proper animals. I went, they are. And I was no proper animals. And I went, do you mean mammals? He went, what are you on about? I said, are these animals, have they got legs and are they fur bearing? Right? And he went, one is. They've got legs on. I went, I don't know. I give up. He went, right, the turtle. I went, right, yeah. And he went, and the Bumblebee. He said, that's the one with fur. That's the one with fur. The. Well, now, what are you thinking? What is in your head, Carl? Which has got the most fur, a bee or a turtle? It's not fur. What is it? Well, it's, it's, you know. He's done you there, Jerry. Pseudo hairs, isn't it? It's like. It's a hair. It's a keratin thing. It's not like we have lot mammals grow furious. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. He's not convinced when we say that. When we say like for mammals are warm blooded creatures, often, usually placental. There's a few exceptions, right, that. That give their milk to their young. Note they're young and they have fur. Have you heard about Osters, Osters, Oysters? They. That one minute they're a man, then they're a woman, then they're a man again. Like Eddie is our. Now that's. That's fabulous. He's a transvestite. Could I say he's not a transsexual? Let's say that straight away. I'm retracting that. Right, go on then, give us some more facts. No, I've got you Aesop's Fables. No, but you had some more facts. You told me that were dead good. I just wondered if Steve knew him. What. What do you want to know? The ones that you read out to me, you had. You had one about a. The spiky thing. Go on, porcupine, give me a clue. How many spikes the porcupine got? Don't know. How many was it? I think it was about 10,000. But these aren't. These aren't the most interesting facts, are they? It's all right. It's all right though, innit? Yeah. And he went. But how can they say that? You could say that, you know, we've got a certain amount of hairs in our head. I went ten, a hundred thousand average. He went, yeah, but I haven't. So how do we know that that porcupine, that they've counted is the same for all of them? Might have had alopecia. Yeah. Yeah. He might have been a particularly hairy. I mean, right, you've got a. Do you know. Do you know what a fable is? I tried to explain briefly. Do you. Do you know what a favorite is? Got a rough idea. Okay. It's a thing that uses sort of metaphor, analogy just to. To. To explain sort of morals. I mean, they're. They're very. They're very Very old, for a start. And it's all thing. I'll give you an example of one. Oh, a quick one. Oh, the one about the. The. The dog with two bones. He goes to a dog's got a bone. He sees reflection in the lake and he thinks, oh, that dog's got a nice bone. I'll have that. And as he goes to get that one in the reflection, he drops the one he's got. And that's one about, you know, I. Think I was told one when I was younger. Go on. I think it was one. This young lad, it's got a dog, right? And he sort of is about 8 years old. And this dog, he's had it since he was about 4, and it's a bit tired now, and he chucks sticks for it. And he doesn't. It doesn't go for it. And he's saying to his mama, I want a new dog because this one's useless. It doesn't do what, you know, it doesn't have any fun with me. So they say, oh, no, but, you know, Rover's a good little dog, should look after it. And he's like, oh, I don't like it. I want a new one. So they buy him a new puppy. And it's. It's running around yapping about, and he's loving it, and he's playing around with it in the grass. And then one day he goes to the park and he's messing about and rolling about with it, and he falls into the lake, right? And the little pup is, like, yapping at him, and he's going, help me, help me. The little dog's yapping. And then the old dog comes and gets his collar and it pulls him out of the lake. And he goes, oh, God, you know, why did I forget about you? You're the better dog. And he loved that one again, rather than the puppy. I got a feeling that was Lassie. Yeah, that was an episode of Lassie. What's the moral? What's the moral there, Carl? What's that? Telling what? What's that? Explaining through analogy. So don't forget the old. Look after old people. I remember there was one I heard once about a young boy who got trapped in a lake inside a cage. But he. He loves trainers so much, he wasn't gonna get them wet. And. But even though he had to get out there, and even though he thought that was the important thing because it's material value, he actually drowned, and the trainers were no good to him then. Star Sailor. Hives. I Hate to say I told you so. Now I want a couple of. Clear a couple of things up. Obviously, me and Steve, we, we love Carl. This is not. This is the things we give Carl to read and talk is not to embarrass him or stress him out at all. We genuinely like his view of the world. In fact, we did an interview yesterday with a bloke from the Standard who really liked the show and said, did you like Carl? You take the piss out of him a lot. And you know, we just like to say we love Carl. I said to that. I said, it's like I've got a new kitten. I can't wait to get in and see his little face on Saturdays, didn't I? Yes. And I think I'm worried because I thought I'd give Carl something he was really get his teeth into with these ease up fables. It involves animals and, you know, little stories. But I've given him a couple and he doesn't seem to be that impressed or understand the concept. You said you'd bring in an animal fact book as well, and I can't see that anywhere. No. Well, you can only read one book at a time, can't you? Why didn't you bring the other one in first? Well, it's big. I've got to work my way up to it. Sometimes I'll probably have to get a cab because it's a bit big. Now listen, I'll give it the good as well. This is an easy one. Now just think, right? Think just what it means. They're not that. They're not that hidden, they're not that cryptic. Just think what this means. Okay? Okay. When the hares addressed a public meeting and claimed that all should have fair shares, the lions answered, a good speech. Hairy feet, but it lacks claws and teeth, such as we have. How would you use that? No, what do you think that means? This. Is this just translated from the. I don't know, Greek or something? I don't know, it was, it was Aesop. Where's he from? Greek. Yeah. So it, you know, it. Should I do it in my own language? Okay, so what would happen if there's. There's hares and they have a meeting in the jungle with like loads of lions and go, hey, hold on one minute. I think we should all be equal and share everything. All right? And the lions go, well, yeah, it's easy for you to say. We've got claws and teeth. Yeah. What does that mean? It's saying like, course the hares want that because it's better for them. The lions get nothing out of it because they're already king of the jungle. That's right. So it's. It's negotiating from weakness. Anyone can negotiate from strength, but negotiating from weakness is your. It's. It's. You know, it's. It'd be lovely. It's a lovely utopian look at the animal kingdom. The way you said it is better than the way they worded it. Well, that's because. But that's because Ricky's very much the modern Nissan. I mean, many people have thought that, you know, that's why he's getting a lot of awards with the TV show. So look, hey, I'll take that home and read ones you like and tell me about the ones you like. Ones that. That click. I don't care if you only come in with like one or two. Go. I'll tell you what, Rick, that's a mate. That. There's one thing that I've learned from that, you know, because sometimes you can all these phrases, and until something happens, you don't. You don't think. You know, everyone's heard, you know, to. I don't know, to err is human, to forgive divine. But. And then summer, you know, might happen. Dude, you go, oh, that. That's what that means. That's amazing. So, you know, do you know any stave I found. What's that, a fable? Well, I would imagine that the most famous one I've always remembered is the. You know, the lion with the. The thing in its hoof. Do you remember that? Yeah. With the spike in its paw. And a smaller animal gets it out for it, but it still attacks it anyway. Well, that's life, isn't it? Well, I read one the other day, actually, which was very interesting. It was one that the famous film director Orson Welles said, oh, yeah. But she said, apparently there was a bear going across a lake. Lake. Wading through the lake. And a scorpion said, well, let me go on your back, will you? Come on, just let me go on your back. We'll go across. It'd be brilliant. He goes, well, no, you're. Just sting me. You go, don't be stupid. If I sting you, you'll die. And we'll both drain. And he goes, oh, fair enough. Who was doing the stinging? The scorpion. Okay. And the bear's wading through the water. Yeah. So the scorpion jumps on the back and they wade through the water. And halfway across, the scorpion stings the bear. And the bear goes, well, we're both gonna die. Now he goes, yeah, it's my nature. I thought he was gonna say, I can swim. Oh, you're the best. What's the one about? Does that mean anything to you? It's my nature. I. E. You know, that's been my nature. That's. That's what I do. Yeah. I'm a scorpion. Yeah. One of my favorite ones. These don't mean anything to you, do they? I mean, one thing is, you're not impressed by them. They're all right. What about this? What about this? He said, well, why not just say don't trust bears? The bear's the one that was too trustworthy. Don't trust scorpions. Right. It's one of my favorite ones of all time. Okay. A lion is dying. It's an old lion. He's in the front of his cave. And all the animals come around, like the foxes and the hyenas and. And the. The rabbits. And they're all taking the piss out of him. And they're laughing at him. And they're laughing again. You can't fight us now. And just before he dies, he goes, fine, but I was a lion once. What does that mean? Don't know. Well, he's saying it's better to have lived and had what I had because I was. I was great, if only for a short time. And you lot are still alive, but you're nothing. You're rabbits and hairs. I was a lion once. So, you know. Are they always using animals for these stories? Well, yeah, I could. I could change it to fridge, refrigerators and household appliances if it make it out, but animals, you know, I remember. The one about being ill a lot. And you say something about. Go on. You know, if you keep doing that, if you keep having time off, I won't believe you. That's the boycott wolf. Is that one? Yeah. Do you know that. Have you heard the famous one? This is probably the most powerful one. When you're pulling a face and they say, well, if you keep doing that, the wind changes. Because you know that scientific proven, that is. That can happen. That can happen. Should we have Hip Hop Hooray? Are you queued up for that? No, but. Go on, you. Carl, sort out, mate. I was gonna. No, come on. This is what. I asked you to play me. If you've not. You know, you're getting too big for your boots now with your showbiz lifestyle. You're not paying attention, are you? Not playing? If you want you to play. Heat magazine's favorite. Yeah, okay. So clumsy. Oh, yeah. You know with the big. I can't believe you're not. Oh, fables are great. He's not impressed, is he? Really? I am. I mean, you know, once I get. Took this book home tonight and that's. Have a read. I might. I might change my mind on them next week. Are you coming all stressed? I'm not impressed with the ones you've. You've been talking about, I must admit. Okay, okay, okay. This album is by this group, Nerd, who are big hip hop and R B producers in the States. Yeah, we've played a track from them in the past. Bobby James. This album's been re recorded. I don't know why exactly, with live instruments. You don't get many R B and hip hop records now with live instruments, so it's pretty. It's all computers in it, Steve, these days and drum machines. And there is a forthcoming single, I suspect he might be. This track, Rockstar. I'm not gonna play that. I'm gonna play a track. Two things are gonna get better, Rick. I believe it's generally acknowledged now that I broke Princess Superstar on this show and she's since had, you know, successful single and album. I'm trying to do the same here with Nerd. In Search of is the name of the album released on April 8th, or should I say re released. Some of us had it a while back, Rick, you may recall they've obviously worked as hip hop, you know, remixers and producers with Jay Z, with P. Diddy, with Khalees. Odb Khalees features on the album that was called Things Are Getting Better and It's dynamite. It's worth getting. I've been trying to break Bob Dylan, haven't I? And Radiohead and all those. Yep. How you getting on? All right. No order here to stay. Sadly, we're not here to stay, Steve. We're not. About 10 more minutes. That's true enough. Yeah. Well, I think that's just time for some interesting facts that Johnny Mango, our researcher from loosecontrol.com has emailed us a few familiar ones. Favorite ones of yours, I think. Any ones. I don't know, though. I don't. I think you know this one, don't you? A pig's orgasm lasts for 30 minutes. I know. And a pig can't actually look directly up. Up. 30 minutes of coming. Absolutely. Be careful here. That's incredible. Remember amateur Tom Bins. Go on. Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for pleasure. Bonobos do as well. They've rediscovered which is it. Which is a Bonobo. Yeah. A chimpanzee. Like a chimpanzee. Right. So. Yeah. So it's three now. Can't believe dolphins are getting. They're all at it now. Yeah. Polar bears are left handed. Yeah. I don't quite know how they work that. They give them spelling tests, lighting tests. Oh, yeah. They probably just do it. It's probably the paw they use to hide up the black nose during a hunt. Of course. Yeah. Some lions mate over 50 times a day. Yeah. Not. Not every day of the year. Okay. They don't do that every day. No. Okay. Because again, I'm worried. No, you know, I didn't think that. What day of the year do you do it 50 times? What is it? It's coming up to it. It's April, isn't it? You'd like to get out there. I have a special day. Yeah. Maybe we could. We could coincide that with the balloon event. It'll just be me quietly humping in the corner. Volunteers, welcome to email now. You know all the proceeds go to charity. If you are a desperate lioness. Exactly. Yeah. Butterflies taste with their feet. I didn't know that. Interesting. I didn't know that. That is interesting. But they don't eat much, do they? Because they only live a day. Good point. They wouldn't need to eat. An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain. Yeah, I knew that. Yeah. That's extraordinary, that is. Yeah. And the, the car. How big are your eyes? Cool. Finally. I think we've discussed this before, haven't we? A cockroach will live nine days without its head. Yeah. Before it starves to death. Yeah. It's only because it can't get water and food yet. It would be quite happy going around doing its normal things. Yeah. I mean probably to work. If you're just as good without your head as with your head. May as well not have a head. I just. I don't see the point. Well, that was thanks to Johnny Mangrove there of. What's his website called, it was turned into a sort of volunteered researcher. Yeah, he's very fast. Loosecontrol.com. can I just say as well, we've had lots of emails from different people just saying they enjoy the show and offering little tidbits and things. Nick Wilson, Sarah and Lauren, Ken, Dan, Jane. She wants a mash. We didn't play Ash. Never mind Lee, Jez, Derry. There's loads of people there. Well, I'm gonna. Again we're talking earlier about, you know, you're not caring about being like A geek or a freak or not trendy. No, I'm just saying I am friendly and I know. Yeah, there. And I'm going to play a bit of an easy listening. I apologize. Those people who still tune in expect to hear two hours of New Metal or gorillas. And this is a very old fashioned, lovely tune. It's Bread. I hope you enjoy it. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Bread. Bread, Bread. Make it with you. Great track and it's a good track. You can't. You can't argue with that. I think Bread defies slightly my test, don't they? The ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage because Bread is a pretty awful name and yet obviously they were very pretty. Yeah, they're pretty big. I think they. Yeah, you're not confusing with the sitcom, I'm afraid. I do. I always associate the two and that's never a good thing. Yeah. Games getting hard because someone's dealing you a losing card. Is that recorded by Bread? I think so. The cast of. Yeah, I think so, yeah. Right. Win it? Yeah, something like that, yeah. Bread. Look at his face lighting up. Did you like tell him an A Stop Faithful? He's not interested. You sing the theme of the Bread? Yeah, Little. Little Manx. Like the Scally sort of Scouser sort of way. I just don't like the Scousers. Why not? Why can't they live together? Why can't they all live together? I tried and then when I went to. Where's that place they have flies the size of. You can't get them in a matchbox. Well, most news agents don't put flies in matchboxes. They. I mean. What do you mean you can't get in a matchbox? You mean buy them? No, I remember being there and thinking, God, the flies are big here. Well, I can't remember. But anyway, there was a Scouse bloke there. What, a country or. Yeah, abroad. Right, okay. Flies are massive. And there was a Scouse bloke there. And I was quite happy to let things, you know, we don't get on, but it's like, I'm on holiday, we're in the same town, let's get on. Yeah, I couldn't stand. Me name was Alan. I think he lives in London now. Couldn't be doing with him. How did he. What did he do? He just was like, oh, I bet you like Man United. And it's like, well, yeah. And he's like the rubbish and going on about my town's dark. It's like when did you go? If it was the winter, it would have been, yeah. He's an idiot. I've never seen Carl like this. He was annoyed. Alan, Alan, if you're listening, you've really wild. Carl. You do not want to get on the wrong side of Pilkington. Anyway, that's pretty much it, isn't it. For this week's Indeed, yeah. Song for the ladies this week, taking on from. From your bread. Really. Same kind of low, you know, acoustics kind of sound. It's Kings of Convenience. Toxic Girl. Beautiful track. Just got time for this. Bye. Bye. See you later. See you next time.",
