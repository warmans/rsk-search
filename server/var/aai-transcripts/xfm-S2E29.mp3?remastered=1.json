  "text": "Beautiful day. You too. To kick off the show, Steve. Absolutely. The Ricky Gervais show with Steve Merchant. Hello there. And Claire Sturges. Hello, boys. Carl's ill. Well, he's not here. I mean, I never believe people in there. I think they're always malingering. I never take any days off work. I just think you can drag yourself in unless it's. Unless it's life threatening or to be fair. Rick, can I just stop you there? It's not so much that you take days off as you'll just suddenly decide around lunchtime that you've opened overeaten and need to go and lie down. But I'm my own cold compress. Yeah. I'm my own boss. Yeah. So it's not supposed to take days off. It's not supposed to take days off as you never actually do a full day's work. Yeah, exactly. I never take that hour and a. Half off a day. Exactly. Xfm 104 point. So what's the story, Claire? Do you know anything about Carl? Do you know what? He's. I think he's got this, this sort of cold virus that's going on. He phoned me yesterday. He did sound poorly in his defense. Well, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what. He coughed a. Not being funny. He better be in hospital. To miss this show. To miss this show. Flagship show of the week on xfm. Do you know, you are right because. And you've been away, haven't you? You know, been away two weeks. We had the best off again. Let's put out the best of. Let's put out the best of the last two weeks, shall we? I mean, we're going to try and get him on the phone, we're going to phone him and, and I want him to really explain himself because, you know, I think he's malingering, to be honest. Well, he phoned me in the week and he said, Steve, don't forget there's a documentary on on Friday night about Oliver the humanzi, the human monkey. He said, he said to me, it's gonna be brilliant. And it wasn't. And it wasn't brilliant. It was. I especially stayed in and watched it. I taped it and watched it afterwards and I've never seen so much hype and desperation. They kept showing the same clip of this, definitely this chimpanzee that. That walked upright like a lot of chimps can. Exactly, yeah. It lost its hair. So it was half human because all humans are bald. Y. So that's the Half human bit. It didn't have hair. I'm sorry, Humans do have hair on their head. The other thing was this, this desperation to go. Could it be after. No, it's a chimp that superficially looks less like a chimp than other chimps. So Lee Evans looks a bit like a chimp. Is he half chimp, half human? No, he's a human. He looks a bit like a chimp. That's fabulous. Yeah, that's a bit insulting. Should we just play some music? Yeah, I'm really sorry about that. I'll get back to you on that. Yes. Foreign tick tock. That's Coldplay and clocks on XFM 104.9. Can I tell you a Coldplay coming in a couple of weeks time to a co host Zoe Ball show. Right. One, don't ever interrupt me. Two, don't tell them about other people's shows. Okay, moving on. Thank you. Please do not mention that there are any other television celebrities on this channel. On this station we are trying to convince you. But it's only Ricky. But the interruption was the main thing. Sorry. Well, we can't get older Carl, Right. We looked. It's got his old number out there. Yeah. It's a holder. So we went to the new records. He hasn't even given this new home number. So somewhat funny going on. He doesn't want to be contacted. He hasn't given me his home number. I've tracked down a friend who's looking it for us. That phone might ring any moment. I apologize for that. But why is Carl not available? It's interesting that neither you or I and I like to think of ourselves as being fairly close friends of Carl. Yeah. We have made him the man he is today. We cannot get in touch with him. In the same way that bloke bought Oliver. Sure. I think that Carl is now ours. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly what he. Yeah, exactly. I think very much that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Carl is very much like a humanzee. We're gonna lose contact with him and find him. Five years in a circus in mansion. Exactly. They're doing experiments on him. Yeah, yeah. And they can't figure him out. Yeah, well, he's. There's something wrong. He looks like a human. He acts like. Because usually humans stand upright. Yeah. And Carl likes to walk on all fours whenever he can. Yeah. He's not interested in other human women. He's only interested in apes. Yeah, yeah. It doesn't make sense. Oh my God. And he's bald. He is bald. Oh, look this. There's as much evidence for Carl being a human Z as Oliver. I think there's more. I think there's more. And. Oh, well, Carl barely walks up. Right. I know. Scared of fire. Yeah, I know. It is interesting, isn't it? Oliver was built, wasn't he? Yeah, I see. I. I don't know. Why were you looking, Rick? I'm interested to you. I couldn't. What? Your eyes were kind of uncontrollably drawn towards there. I didn't see any. I was just looking at his face. No. Sorry, Rick, but if there's something you. Want to get off your chest and that's. That was the human part of it then, was it being built like that? Because it's humans. If it. Yeah. Although Carl's is very tiny and hidden behind. Andy's got. I've noticed, some house as well. He's got a big red arse. That's true, hasn't he? Yeah. Yeah. It's all beginning to slot into place. And I've seen him climb up a cabinet and eat a banana as well, just to. Yeah. And peel it with his toes. It's all coming together. Right. We're gonna track him down because he's malingering. He's definitely. I'll tell you what, he's at home now in the garden, swinging on his tire. He's not ill. I think, more truthfully, someone said to me that. I said Carl might be ill. They said, right. Are you not going to do the radio show then? Well, that's what annoys me. I mean, that's the biggest problem is that, let's be honest, we haven't got anything without. All we've got is the hook. People are staying listening because eventually they think we might get through to him at home. Yeah. And there'd be fun on this show to be had. If we don' in touch with Carl, I think we may as well just shoot off and leave Claire to do the show. I've got some great music. Is that not. It's a small. You could leave the music with me. I could just play. There's not many reasons. Okay. Play some great music now. Great tune. Okay. Wedding present. Steve. Yeah. I'll explain what it is after. Just play it. It's a joy. It's a monkey. There's a monkey thing. There is a. There is a monkey connection. Call in if you know the answer. Pleasant doing their cover version of Pleasant Valley Sunday. That's from this new compilation of those. Remember they brought out load of 7 inches. My favorite day yeah, absolutely. And on the Beast, on the B side of each one, there was a cover of a different song. Steve. I even played the B side of each one and listen to the song. The connection there that we're talking about was, of course, it was by the monkeys. Indeed. Yeah. Yeah. They turned up in yesterday's episode, didn't they? A lot of people, I'm sure, won't have seen this documentary. It was on Channel 5, after all. So I always feel like we should remind people that what we're actually talking about, if we just happen to mention Oliver, a lot of people don't know what that means. Yeah. If we explain that it is the primate version of Carl. Yeah, that's exactly, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it was. They were on a Japanese humanzee, the. Humans he was on a Japanese TV show with, they were doing experiments on him to find out if he was half human. And the monkeys happened to be there. Yeah. Mickey Dillon saying, you know, I'm quite interested to find out because, you know, I'm a monkey. One of. Brilliant, Excellent. Bizarre. Of course, we. We've been off jetting around the world. Claire, I don't know. I don't want to boast. I'm sure you don't want to boast either. Carl told me he'd been off, you know, to the States. Yeah. That was the reason we weren't here the last couple of weeks that we went to Los Angeles. It was a little bit of business, a little bit of pleasure. You know, I like to combine the two. It was. We were meeting a company about doing the Office for America, actually redoing it. Yeah. Or any of the cast. American actors. American actors. But the thing was, they. They were flying us over. It was like the whole business class trip, you know, spending a little bit of money and. Virgin upper class, actually. Excellent. It's brilliant. Definitely get free flights down here. Definitely. Yeah. Richard Branson, lovely bloke and I love it. I don't think he owns it anymore. Does he not? But he's still a lovely bloke. He's still a good. What does he own? He must own somewhat. We can get. Oh, does he involve with Virgin Records anymore? Wouldn't have thought so. I don't know. V2, what does he do? V2 and Virgin V, what's that? Right. Virgin V is some beauty products. Virgin underwear. Brilliant. Yeah. Give us. Give us some of that. But I was going to New York before going on to Los Angeles, where all the meetings were just for a little. Just meet some Friends over in New York. And it's amazing because Virgin business class, they pick you up in a sort of chauffeur driven car. They drive you down. There's no. But you don't have to check in with all the wishes. Strange and upper class. It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't need to sort of queue up with the great unwashed with screaming kids, with ordinary people. Yeah. You know, basically you get you. They just send your information ahead to the airport and you just drive through a kind of drive through McDonald's style. Check in, they take your bag, they check your passport. Boom. They drop you at the executive lounge where there is, I swear to God, lovely free plums. I had two lovely juicy free plums in. Exactly. I haven't eaten plums. He forgets the bloke's name. But they are. He had lovely juicy free plums. All right. That's the song. That is why. That's the sort of wit that I'm capable of. That is why he is flying first class. He meant. I changed it. I transposed the whole thing. So suddenly he was sucking on a man's testicles who he'd never met before. Exactly. For money. Exactly. That's the sort of things I'm kind of half true. So he's used his comedy mind. No money involved. Right. Is why he was being jetted off to America to talk comedy. That is the kind of quality. But it was. It was great. It was a really lovely flight. It was a lovely car. Luxury car. And the flight was like the advert. I've got those beds that sort of just. Well, they totally recline. Recline. So it's almost anything you want as much. And I was sort of like fallen asleep and I sort of woke up and one of the heiresses was about covering me with a blanket. It was like the advert. Yeah, it was just brilliant. All the lights came down, comes around. And says, do you want a massage during the flight? If you have as much drinks. Although you can't drink. You have a drink and then you fall asleep because it's so comfortable when they take the lights. Anyway, I can't believe my luck. So I'm driving down, I get to the airport in my chauffeur driven car. Right. I'm sat there, I'm phoning people, my mum and dad. You never believe what I'm off to. Just say, I'm just in the car, just chauffeur driven car. And I get to the airport and you just hand your passport through the window of this car to this little woman who comes over. And I'm just there. I'm just sort of buzz, buzzing the window down, handing it to her, buzzing it back up like, I don't want to talk, check the passport, take my luggage. I don't want to discuss things, you know, who I am. And she hands the passport back through the window. She says, it's expired. I went, you are. What do you mean? She went, it's expired. I said, it's business class. What can you do? Can you do anything? And she went, no, we can send you to America, but eight hours later you'll have to just turn around and come back. They won't let you through immigration. I was like, what I'm gonna do? I gotta go to Los Angeles and talk about, like the office in that. And she said, well, it's up to you. So the chauffeur driven car drove me straight to the passport office down in sort of Victoria, which I have to. Say, back into town. So I had to go back into town. I didn't get on a plane. I'm wearing my suit because I thought I'd wear the suit. So I look like a real player. So I'm wearing my suit. I love the fact that you wore. I wore a tracksuit because I thought, I don't need to get upgraded. I'm first class. Exactly. I wanted to go on in my pants and slippers, but, you know, wasn't. That why she covered you with a blanket? But. So they take me back down to the past. I don't know if you've had to go down and get your passport changed, but they treat you like you are an illegal immigrant sneaking into the country. I'm wearing a suit, I've got luggage. You know, I'm clearly a dignified kind of guy. That's obvious. I'm speaking with a certain eloquence. I've got certain powers. I'd just be working on it in the car. All right, okay. And they just. And they said, you've got to come back that night. So I had to come back. I had to. I had to get my passport. I had to buy a sandwich. I had enough change for the machine because it was not. It was an absolute nightmare. I ended up. I spent. I began the day in a chauffeur driven car on my way to Los Angeles to discuss business with Universal Television Pictures. And I spent. I ended the day on the tube in a suit with my luggage. Stood next to one of the posters advertising this radio show. Which was just embarrassing because people kept pointing and staring and laughing. He called me, called me like they said, rick, I've really much. I'll go on. He went, my passport was right. I went, oh, so what are you gonna do? He went. He said, right. I quote. He went, I didn't know passports expired. Yeah. I went, what do you mean? I went. He went, well, your driving license doesn't. I went, what are you talking about? He said, how old do you have to be to know that? He said. He said, when will I know all these things? Yeah, when will I know all these things? I want to just come and hug. You, but you know what I mean. Did you know that? Did you genuinely know that your passport. I did. Because my passport expired. Because she's alive. Because she's alive in the. There is so much stuff that I don't know because I don't think I've reached a certain age yet. I remember you walking down the street once and you said there were some roadworks and you said, they're probably doing those roadworks because at the end of the financial year, I thought, how do you know that information? Yeah, exactly. But I don't talk to cabs. I mean, chauffeur driven cars. I put the little window up so they don't talk to me. How old are you? 28. Are you old enough yet to help a long distance lorry driver back into a car park? Definitely not. Oh, you're an idiot. Play a record. And I'm also. I'm not old enough yet to be able to say, can I have a pint lark, please, Chief? In the pub. I wonder. I want to get to that age. You love my arm, Ryan Adams. I'm. I can't get enough of him now, Steve. I've just been buying up everything. I love him. And that was answering about coming up after the ads and that. Oasis and that. Brilliant. Excellent. Another classic there from Oasis Supersonic on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Claire Sturgis standing in for hello for carpet. Where is Carl? Where is Carl? So we've failed to get in touch with him at home. Well, look, he doesn't want to be contacted. He's turned up every phone off. He hasn't. Give the XFM his new home phone number. He doesn't want to be contacted. I can't believe he's not listening, to be honest. So you think he's listening now? Yeah, he listened. He listened in Manchester. If he's not listening, he's out and about. I mean, has anyone spotted Carl? What's your message to him, Rick? If he's listening, call up. Anything else? More sort of call up while you're fired. Okay. Any bad language you want to use. Obviously you can't really. I can't really say it. What sort of words? I mean, the F word, would you say? I'd say the F word. I'd call him a twat. Would you use the P word? I'm thinking of Prick. Prick, Yeah, I definitely use that. Not. Not on air. But I call him a stupid little prick. Would you just say. Yeah, yeah, okay. All right, little. You stupid little bag of tits. I'd say, yeah. I mean privately. What about the MF for it? Because that's pretty intense. That's pretty hardcore. Do you think that this is not appropriate now? Do you think he's. Do you think that would be too. Too extreme? I'm worried if I use that and he was genuinely ill, I'd feel a. Bit of a C word. Cop. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Because I wasn't thinking about that. I mean. I mean a male bird. Sure. Because we've got in trouble with that before, meaning penis. And we don't mean that. Yeah, we definitely don't mean penis. But if. If you do. If anyone out there. Sorry. Sorry about that. It was a discussion about bad language. You weren't actually using it. But if any of you out there do see the little twat, get him to call XFM immediately. Yeah. And likewise, if you're listening, Carl, your cheeky mf, well, you're sexy mf, as Prince once said. Yeah. Give us a ring because we'd love to talk to you. We just want to find out. Just calling. We know you're listening. Little Amy man. Red Vines. Brilliant. Lovely Track on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Claire Sturges in for Carl Pilkington. Little. He hasn't called. He may be really ill. I'm feeling a bit. Yeah. How ill is he, though? I mean, do you know what I mean? How ill have you got to be to not be able to make a phone call? Yeah, I've got a sore bottom and I made it in. Keep talking. I pulled a muscle in my bum. How? I don't know. And it really hurts. Have you tried to trace back through the week and figure out what may. I went to see the osteopath yesterday. He put an elbow in it for half an hour. I cried. Yeah. Is it. Oh, they got detachable elbows for those Prosthetic. Elbows. Just hold this elbow in there for two hours and. Yeah, yeah, you can take that away, though. I won't be needing that elbow for quite a while. We had an email about Oliver, the humanzee. For those that didn't watch it, there was a documentary last night about a chimp that was supposedly a human or was half human or. My favorite program ever. Yeah. For a week, Carl has been saying, it's gonna be brilliant. I wish he was here. And he's not here to discuss it, sadly. But Lee Cranston has emailed in and says, I thought the best part of the Oliver program was the guy, Vincent Pace, camp fellow at the piano, telling how he first met Oliver. Quote, he grabbed his female owner, turned her around and bent her over and went to mount her. I made her offer to buy him the next day. Vincent was then shown in a very nostalgic mood playing melancholic music. He obviously wanted some monkey action. He really. That's, that's. I mean, it is potentially liable. You know, it's a joke there. But we take. I don't take any responsibility for what Lee Cranston says or indeed the fact that he quite. He puts at the end. Did he want to turn Oliver into a gay pansy? Question mark. That's Lee's thoughts and opinions. He sees the, the chimp mount a human and go, I've got to have that chimp. I must have that chimp. Oh, poor Carl. Where is he? As you mentioned earlier, he was very well endowed. Apparently. I didn't see it myself. It was a big. It was a big chimp. A big half boy. A big half boy, half chill. Okay. Honestly, Juan on XFM 104.9. Right. I just called Carl again. I've been calling him all the time, trying to get through to him, right? He's changed his message. So he is listening and I've got proof. So can you just call the number, Claire? Yeah, right, right. Call someone. Now listen to this. This. This is really annoying. We should tell you now that this is not an amusing sketch or setup. Now, what's happening there, Claire? Not quite happening for me. No, no, it's all right. We'll try, try again. Try that again, Claire. Yeah, I'm livid now. I'm genuinely annoyed because you'll see, when you hear the message, you'll realize why. Right, okay. All right, let's try again. I don't know who he thinks he is now. I, I'm beginning to wonder if, if his minor celebrities go into his head all this nice write up in Heat magazine. Yeah, it's changed him. Richard Anderson, incidentally, is emailed in. Go on, Dickers. Anderson. It's not only me, is it there? Why not? Because I'm a bit stupid. I can't work it out, can I? Can't figure it out. How would you call someone normally? Well, normally I just pick up the phone and dial it. It. Sure. No, I don't mean. No, I mean. But it's like I have a problem getting it through the desk. I tell you what, can I play an ad break and practice, pretend this didn't happen and then go. In a weird way, it's like having Carl play the ads. I'll get back to you. Better snoop? Never. And when did. When did a bit of snoop ever hurt anyone, Steve? Absolutely never. I don't think. Okay, Carl's away. He pulled the wool over Claire's eyes. There a few people out there that believed he was ill. I knew he wasn't. In fact, at one point I thought maybe he is ill. His message on his answer machine has changed in the last five minutes and listen to it. And this is evidence that he's not ill. Right, okay. Yeah. Don't. We don't. Anderson. Richard Anderson. I should just say has. Has got in touch. Okay, here we go. Hold on. Oh, Claire, I can do it. Just tell Anderson this is ludicrous. Yeah. So obviously Richard Anderson, he's easy money in his thoughts. Dickie Anders. Anders. Randy Anders, yeah. Dick Meister General. And he says there's something making. Have we got it clear? There's something. He says there's something making strange yelping noises in the thicket at the end of my garden. Shall I go and prod it to see if it's carnal? Sorry, I'm not in today, but not well on that. No more Rockbusters. I think that's what's affected me. It's got me down a bit. So he's joking. Yeah, the doctor said I'll. I'll be back swinging on my tire in no time. So. So he was listening. He's clearly listening. So he has was listening because we said about swinging on me at any time, right, Carl, call me. In fact, I'll tell you what, we play a little game. Carl would appreciate this. Call me Carl, or I'm going to give out your number. What's the first five or six digits, Claire? Well, it's 07968. 07968. Okay. Phone now, Carl. Start calling now. Right, Give the next number, Claire, you Said give the next number one. Make one of these. Because if you want to call 07968 and the first number to be given out is one. He's not ill. Is. How do you feel now, Claire? Because he's made a fool of you because you believed him. He's made a monkey out of you. Last night, but now passed out. I'm. I feel a little bit let down. Right, Right. Okay. So we give a number out every five minutes until Carl calls. Because we know he's listening now. He's having. He's taking the piss. He's not ill. Obviously, you can hear that. He could if that was as long as a link. So he could have been here. He could eat. Definitely call. Are we leaving this message? Is this a message we're still leaving on his phone? Yeah, we're still leaving it. Good. Yeah, good, good. Yeah. Why don't we leave the rest of the show on his phone? Yeah, leave it up. He's got. Listen through it all. So he can delete it. Yeah, exactly. And the other thing, of course, is that he's not gonna get paid for this. No. So he. So he's throwing away 80 quid. That's £80 now in Manchester. That's a week's wages. So he's obviously been spoiled. So for all his mank charm, he's down here. He's living the life of riding. Quits nothing. He thinks 80 quid's nothing. Or whether you could be buying what you said you could. Buying yourself your own horse. Yeah. You could probably get yourself a deposit on a flat. I'd have thought so. I thought so. Yeah. And so, you know, or sun lamps because it's always dark. Yeah. He could go mental up there now. So what? What? So what's the first few digits we've given out? 07968. Yeah. And then. And then one. Okay. We give out. We give out another Carl's digits. So take that down because we love calling him. Should we have a little bit of feed or something? Let me just tell you what. What Dick has said. Yeah. He said Richard Anderson. He also said, ps, the rubbish without Carl. Still rubbish. Still rubbish without Carl. Now, is that a compliment? It's still rubbish without Carl. Which suggests he thought it might be better with. Without Carl. No, I think he means he's equally rubbish. Right, brilliant. Nothing changes. Thanks, Dickers. Yeah. Dick Meister. That's feeder, just away. I'm feeling on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Claire Sturges. Well, he's defying me. He's not calling in. We're going to give out his number and he's not calling in. That's even more annoying. What does he think he is? I don't know who he thinks he's. I, I'll tell you what he. I'll tell you who he is. Yeah, he is a little bold Mancunian. Let's never forget that. I don't know who he thinks he is, but there's the fact just. Carl, call in because you're annoying me. And Steve, he's been slagging you off as well. Steve. Well, go on. In the week, you know, he was slacking you off. I mean, in the week I was joining in and laughing along. But now I'm thinking I'm gonna, I'm gonna. No, but now I'm thinking that you're more on my side than he is. Thanks very much, Rick. I'm glad to see you've come round. He said he was, I was in, in the, in the pub with him and Johnny. All right, sounds a little audience Good. And he said, he went, oh, he went, have you seen Men in Black too? I went, no. He said, have you, John? He went, no. He went, oh, there's, there's a thing in it that looks. Steve. And I went, what? He went, it's a thing. He's got really gangly arms and, and bulbous eyes and it just works really fast in the aliens registration thing. And I went, all right. I said, we'll bring that up Saturday since he's not here, you know. What do you think that. Well, I, I, the reason is, I think the problem I have with is this, that if, if I was to say things like that about Carl, I'd destroy him. He'd be a broken man. After I finish with him, call in. Carl or Steve's gonna say a few things about you. I'm gonna get a couple of home truths out there. I can't believe it. I cannot believe it. Yeah, we haven't, we were, you know, at the time I was joining. We have been, you know, slagging you off on other things as well. Sure, sure. But now I'm thinking maybe I, maybe you were wrong. Maybe I was. Yeah, maybe I was taking the mickey out the wrong person behind their back responder. Because the Night from Patty Smith co written, of course, with Bruce Springsteen. Oh, it was a co. Wrote was. Oh, wow. There you go. Learning something. Learning Something on XFM 104.9 Ricky J. Steve Merchant, CLA Sturges no, Carl. Well, Carl's annoyed me. He's not playing. He's not ill. Another digit from the number. Yeah, just do one more digit. Claire, you serious? Yeah, yeah. Five. Five. Five. So 1 5. Okay, great. We'll just keep doing that. But I'll tell you what the best revenge is living well indeed. Why don't we just do a brilliant remaining 50 minutes of. Of show, okay, and show the people that we don't need Carl, high five. Okay, you don't need Carl. Right, let's go. Starting now. Some brilliant. Some brilliant stuff. Oh, you're gonna say something. Yeah. No, I remember when I was. I remember when I was growing up in Manchester. It's funny to me, I'll tell you. XF 1.2.9. I said, no, I saw a weird thing. I saw, you know, wearing Leicester Square. I was coming through trying. I saw a hairy Chinese kid. No, I don't. It was weird because they're not usually airy, are they? E. Did I tell you about me Auntie Flora? It's supposed to be by eck as like. Did I tell thee about me Auntie Flora who shat herself for three hours once? Did that tire? Oh, E. I don't. Oh, there was a woman born once. You have to phone us. We've got nothing. Oh, God, he's so annoying. Richard Ashcroft Bite in bottles on XFM 104.9. Well, we might not have car, but I think we got a few ads, haven't we? Got quite a few out of time. That's the new one from Blur. Out of time. Only three now. Probably had a sort of Carl equivalent who sort of thought, well, I can't. I can't be bothered. Graham Cox. And they're probably at home listening to that. Exactly. Playing guitar. And they've come up and said, well, you. You could play that. He went, no, I'm ill. Yeah. Oh, I'm ill. Come on, Graham. Just. If you're trying. I can hear you playing guitar now. No, no, I'm ill, yeah. Have they replaced Coxon? No, they haven't replaced him, no. Oh, right. Well, they probably will do when they go on tour, but I think they aren't. Well, I play guitar. I don't know. That's true enough. You're pretty hot. Yeah, if you want someone to. Oh, actually, Steve, in answer to your question for the live dates, it's one of the blokes from the Verve expert. Did she interrupt me again? I think so. I'm a fear in it. God, I can't think I was talking. I don't know if. You know, I might be mental, but I think I was talking. Claire, when's your radio show on normally? When do you host a radio show? Am I allowed to plug it? Yeah, go on. Monday to Thursday, 9pm Maybe we should. Come along and start talking over you. I just wondering, Rick. I'm just wondering who's listening at that time. I mean, what. We've got a prime time which everyone is sat at home listening on a Saturday afternoon. Claire. Yeah, it's one of best radio. Go to football matches or shopping or anything like that. I want a piece of the action. I need it. Yes, I need it. Well, you've got it. And they're. They're playing a few dates here and there. Old Blur. Blur, good. And that's off their new album, probably with all the other songs in there. Rick, I was watching TV last night, I just. It might have been during the monkey show, actually, I'm not sure. But there's an advert and it reminded me of a little crush that I just felt I should express because I wonder if, you know, I've often used the platform in the past just express my feelings for people. Yeah. And I've realized now for many, many years I've had a big crush on the Scottish widow from the Scottish widow adverts. She's. I just. I just want to say to her, you know, is it because she's sort. Of mysterious and hooded? Partly that. It's also because I know. I guarantee she's available because she's just lost. She's a widow. Yeah. And I just think it's time to stop grieving. I think you've been grieving too long. I think I want to say to her, you're a beautiful lady. She's probably got a big lump sum. I'm thinking she's probably got a sizable amount of cash. Yeah. She's obviously got a lot of spare time on her hands not working or raising kids because she's wandering across the moorlands. I'm thinking it's time or they turn to crack or something. But I'm just saying this. I think it's just time to say yes, he was a great man. He was a good man. He was a lovely guy. He worked. It's time to move on. He won't want to see you like this. Still grieving after 25 years. No, he'd want. He'd want to see her being humped by a big lanky thing with steamed up glasses. I reckon I'll be Honest with you. He hasn't got much say in the matter. He's dead. Well, all right. Don't get nasty, frankly. She's still not over there. She is squandering that money. She could be out. She could be in Europe. She could be in Barbados or Hawaii. She could be spending that cash. She could lose the hooded short and maybe slip into a nice bikini. Do you know what? I think she's kept herself in shape. I reckon she's wearing nothing under that. That's what I'm thinking. Dirty slut. And I'm assuming. I'm assuming, as she's Scottish, that he. Couldn'T wait for him to go. She couldn't wait for the poor blok to go. He was obviously. I bet he was a little bit thrifty. He's probably got quite a lot stashed away that she's slowly working her way through. Yeah. And. Oh, I want to find out. I want to find out. Oh, he died. Yeah. I was intrigued because if. Because if I find it's like, oh, there was a roller skate on the top of the stairs, I'm going to. Reopen the investigation in any way suspicious. Yeah. Yeah. Questions? Your husband's dead. And she went, oh, no. Where's the money? Yeah. Steve Merchants outside. Exactly. Yeah. Built like a donkey. Yeah. He's built like a. He's built like Oliver the chimpanzee. Yeah. And he wants to get at it. Yes. He's bought his tandem. We're going off to the moors. Yeah. He's gonna fly executive class. Yeah. His passport is valid. I know that. He's got another 10 years on the passport. Well, I'll tell you what. The boys from Blur, they don't rock. Sure. Should we show them how to rock With a bit of Bad Company? It's a classic. Turn it up, Claire. Bad company. Can't get enough of your love. I'm in a rock mood because Carl's made my blood boil. Yeah. Really. I might even play a song, you're probably too young, called Spirit of the Radio by Rush. It's sort of like, for rockers, apparently, that it's like the ultimate sort of pump rock, progressive pop song ever. It's. It's. It's classic. You can. You can. You might hate it or you'll love it or you listen to it ironically. I love it. Well, you know, I. I just. I. I was listening to Led Zeppelin recently. I never really understood the rock phenomenon before, but I just understand it now. It just gets in your blood. It's extraordinary. Crank it up loud. And it is just visceral and amazing and I wish I could play the guitar. Sure. Do you know what I feel like doing? What? Writing a little sort of him or. Ballad, but to Carl. To Carl, yeah. We've tried threatening him. That's not worked. Give out one more digit. We got half hour to go because the three digits, so it's. Oh, what is it? Oh, oh, seven, nine, six. Eight. Yeah. One, five. Next digit, please. Seven. Okay, 147. I hope you're making a note of that. You'll be able to phone Carl, leave messages, tell him what you think of him. Unless he phones. He can stop this at any time by just simply calling. You can just call and say, okay, don't. You can just call and say, say, please don't give my number out. And I go, as I always do when I'm winding him up and I'm slapping his head and I'm sort of like spitting on him and stuff. Eventually he goes, shouts, stop it. And I go, we only had to ask. Exactly. So if he calls, I go, you. Only have to ask. Flaming lips on XFM 104.9. Well, we got through it without Carl. I think so, yeah. I've enjoyed myself. Didn't mention him much of it. No, I don't think so. I don't think we need him. I always quite enjoy it when he's abstination. I know. Because. Yeah, air. Because we can have a nice chat as opposed to just going, you remember when I had Chinese air and they were old woman. Yeah. Eating her own legs. A forest gump in a wheelie bin. Yeah, yeah. Brings a certain kind of level of class to it. Dare I say that, you know, she's inept in her own way. In a way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean there's no way. Oh, no, no. There's no one any good working, I mean. No, no, no. There's no like property proper. I, I, I, the only proper DJ is probably Camfield, I'd have thought, because he's been, he's, he's nearly 13 now and he's been there, he's been in the radio 12 and a half years. Yeah. See, he took, they tested him and he's half human, half Vance. Yeah. Which is, which is quite, yeah, he's. Got quite a lot of. I think he's got the 48 chromosomes. Yeah. Tommy Vance has got. Yeah, yeah. That makes one Tommy Vance a little bit extra. Yeah. Because one of those chromosomes is pure Jack Dan. Yeah. It's just Jack Daniels. Crimson. Exactly. There's some Lemmy jeans I think you'll find in there as well. In there. But although I'll tell you what, I share with Camfield a couple of loves, I agree that one of the greatest programs of all time is Colombo. Colombo is brilliant. It is amazing. Yeah. And they're showing them what? There's so many channels showing them now. I think Granada plus show them. I think BBC show them. I think that everyone's got a bit. I think he's made 18,000 episodes. He's still making them, though. No, they did in the 90s. They're. They're not quite as good, but I think the original ones, they're great. He's got this great character and I share that with him. I. You know, I do like a bit of rock. Should we play Rush? Just Spirit of the Radio. I mean, we get. We get canned by people who like new metal and Blair and that, and those trendy bands, all that, the kids bands and that. But you think this is pure. Yeah, I don't think this would feature in X Ray magazine. We've got some great bands in them. They've got Kaloop, they've got Damp, they've got Flap Nibble coming out with their new single. It's an EP and a strap. Not. Not the latest strap. The early strap. The Unrecorded Years, which is the only ones I like by Strep. And that guy in it, you know that. The drummer, Kibble. He's gone. He's got his own scone fringe. He's in for a chat with Christian on the Breakfast show, where you could win a trip to O'Neill's and Camden. This is Rush. Rush and Spirit of the Radio. Everything in that. Let's look quick. Let's put every type of music. Okay, go to Reggae Interrupt. Okay, Opera. Go. Go mental now. Go mental on the drums. Double that, Double the foot. How many. How many bass drums have you got? Just to go mental on it? Yeah, right. It is obscene. That is everything in that, isn't it? How long is it? Like four and a half min. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. That's. That's lovely. People don't play music like that. There's only three of them. I just think of them. Yeah, there's that. And just one day in Canada. Yeah. They just went, right, we might. Let's make. We're only gonna write one single. Yeah. So let's put every type of music into that single. It's almost like a stars on 45. Yeah. Version of Music all the time. They've heard. Exactly. Yeah. Are they still going? Do they still catch? I don't know, I don't know. I have no idea. But that was for Camfield. There was bad company there in rush for Camfield Colombo. That was for Camfield as well. The A team. Do you remember once when we were talking about the A team and I was slagging it off on your show in the old xfm? Yeah, yeah. And I was going, I mean I quite like the 18, but it is too, it's sometimes it's too far fetched to enjoy without it being ironic or it being for kids. And I could hear fuming from outside. I could feel him going. He didn't know who to call. He wanted to call Vance or someone or Lemmy. He didn't know. Right. And then I, I, I said, and if you can't find, you know, find the atm. They outwit the might of the FBI every single week. But an old woman who's having trouble with her landlord can find them. And the door burst open and Campy went. That is because Hannibal sometimes disguises himself as an elderly Chinaman. Yeah. And that was his explanation for the whole series. Yeah. Ah, that was for Camfield. That's lovely. That's for his 12th birthday, which is coming 13th. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Teenager. Yeah. Oh, he's going to, he's going to rock, Steve. Indeed. Oh, the phone's going. Play that break. I'll answer. Oh, it might be Cole. Xfm 104.9 in London. Xfm, wow. Here's a bit of a turn up for the books. Carl Pilkington on the line. Yeah. Where you been? I'm off Phil Arma. Right, okay. What's the matter with you? Just a bit bunged off the mat and got the shapes. Got that sort of that shaky thing again. Yeah, that's because you didn't eat last time when Suzanne was at work. Yeah, well, I think that's what brought it on. Plus she was away in the week and I put some wet jeans on and that's, I think that's what's caused the problems. Where did you put them? On your head? No, they were just on the maiden and the legs felt dry, but just. On the what on the what have you got? The maiden. Maiden? What was she doing there? What do you mean? I'm a maiden that you put clothes on. What? Your clothes? Horse. Well, yeah. Right, okay. So you put wet jeans on. Yeah, so that's why I'm ill on that. I'm having a good time. I've been watching the football. So you're just sitting at home watching telly where you could have been sitting here? Well, I would have been better off there because I've got a chair there. I've got no chair at home at the moment because I rolled it last week. Why did you sell a chair? What? You only had one chair. What? Look, can't we just. I just was calling up to let you know I was all right and. That we're not interested in that. We want to know about the chair. I sold it. I had a little two seater and I sold it because I'm getting a new one. But I've got to wait another month. So you've got to sit on the floor. So you sold a chair before you had another one? She might not have wanted to buy it in a month or something. So I got rid of it whilst I could. She was. Alright, buddy, we'll talk about that next week. Oh, you're gonna be in next week. I look forward to that then. That's a dynamite piece of radio to tune in for the day. Carl sold a chair. Brilliant. All right. Are you all right then? It's going all right. But why did you take this long to call? We asked you to call. Since the very beginning. We've been phoning you. Why is your phone. I heard the beginning. I heard the beginning of the show. I thought, yeah, it's going all right, they're there and stuff. Turned it off. You turned it off? No, no, I put a taping though, because even though I'm here still, I'm still showing an interest in it. Well, you're not if you're watching football and shaking. Yeah, well, I'll listen back to it later. So I hope you haven't been dissing me. No, definitely not. Don't listen back to it. It's not worth it. But we haven't been dissing, you know. I've just been watching football. Right. Did you watch the monkey program last night? You told us to watch the monkey program. We all stayed and watched the monkey program. All right. What's rubbish? Wasn't it obviously, obviously not half chimp, half human. I mean, they missed out a lot of the interesting bits. They didn't have any interesting bits. Those are bits that you made up to make it more interesting. The bits that I told you about about three months ago before they decided to make the program. Yeah. What were the bits that you came up with? Well, they missed out the bits about, you know, the zookeeper Right. There wasn't a zookeeper. Yeah, go on. Well, there was, but they left that bit out. Well, okay, fine. And they left. And they left out the bit where it ran from there. In 1975, it took those that did research. They actually went and filmed it. You read it on the Internet. Yeah, yeah. Chances are you're the one with the facts wrong. Yeah, they, they. I think they also left out the bit when it jumped over three double decker buses on a. Yeah. Evil Knievels motorbike. Yeah. So. I can't believe it. I cannot believe it. Not only do you not bother turning up, but you turn off the radio and start watching football. Yeah, I turn it off, but I've recorded it. I'll listen back later. And what good is that? That sort of. I like to keep, you know, keep it in shape and that. I'll have a word next week. All right. If you receive any phone calls from people you don't know. We don't know anything about that instantly. We don't know why. Why that is happening. That is just going to be a weird, spooky thing, so. And don't bother telling the story about men in black 2 either, because I don't think people would be interested actually. On the subject of Men in Black. What? Have you seen that steam? No, I haven't, Carl. Tell me about it. You should see it. Go on. Why? Because there's this thing in it. Go on. What a stupid, bold, Mancunian tosser. No weirder than that. There isn't anything weirder than that. Hey, guys. It was gangly. Keep talking. You've gotta see it because you wouldn't believe out the likeness. And that's right. It's not as weird. I had a normal voice. Right. He's done yet. He's not even here. I'll tell you what, mate. Ain't worth coming in next week. Oh. Oh. Stay on the line, Carl. Play a record, Claire. Kings of Leo on Molly's Chambers. What do you think of that, Carl? All right. There's a surprise. Oh, another full remark. Steve is not a fan. Now, not only does he know you've been slagging him off behind his back. I wasn't slug, Steve. If you get it out on the DVD tonight, you'll know I'm not slagging you off. It could be your brother. I love the fact that it makes it worse, but he's. Think you're going to go. Go. Oh, he wasn't slugging me off. It does look like me. I do think I'M an alien. I love the fact that you hope Steve will go. He's got a point. It's the. It's. No, it's a spitting image. Yeah, I am. Seriously, Carl. I mean, really angry. I'm so angry with you at the moment. You haven't seen it yet. No, I know because I know what it's going to be and I'm just. I'll tell you why I'm angry, because he doesn't do it in jest. What do you think it's going to look like? What do you think this thing's going to look like? Going to look ludicrous. It's not going to look anything like me, but he's going to pretend it does. Does. Go on. What? Go on. No, it does look like you. Yeah, of course it does. And you looked like the human Z. Well, I mean, to be honest, you did a bit, Carl. You walk like him, you're bold like him. You got a sort of gormless face like him anymore. I don't smoke. That does not arguing with you. I'm not well on that. Oh, you're not well. What exactly is wrong with you? You whinger. Well, it's just. Do you know, like I always tell you about the restless leg syndrome I've got. It's like that all over. So you're just shaking around the house. I'm just. Yeah. What do you look like, Elvis? What are you doing? You're shaking around the house. I tell you, with your bald head you're probably like an enormous vibrator. Oh, that's what you probably look like if you strip naked. Oh, you'll have a Scottish widow coming round. Oh, dear. That's. What's the name, by the way? I heard you talking about that. That's Amanda Lamb. Amanda Lamb who's in the Place in the sun program. Is she actually a widow? Is she a Scottish widow? Man, my husband's dead. Do you want any money? And a bit of my clam? Brilliant. All right. That's the sort of quality you've missed out on today. Well, anyway, you're gonna be back next week, I guess we. We need you back next week. Week. Yeah. Well, do you know that's also. How did you know you were going to be ill today? Because you phoned and arranged this yesterday and I spoke to you yesterday and you didn't sound very ill. I felt ropey yesterday. You've got a bit of a bunged up nose. I still sorted it out. I'm a little bit sweaty sorting out does not mean you phone up Sturgis and send her down. That's not sorting it out. That's making things worse. Have you learned nothing? If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. Yeah, I'm a little. My leg's a little bit achy. Wearing wet jeans. Oh, I put wet jeans on again. Wasn't. It was frozen. Can you hear the venom and hatred in our. In our voices today? We genuinely are upset and angry with you. Yeah. Can't believe it. I cannot believe that you'd. I mean. Oh, right. Well, the thing is that we'll be back to normal next week. Right. We've got Billy Elliot. It doing the film next week. Right. Any prizes? Got some good stuff. Have you got any films with Bert Reynolds in to give away on vhs? We'll. I'll see you then. Great. We're looking forward to it already. I'll see you later. See you later. Hot, hot heat. Bandages. Xfm. We're off in it. That's it. It's all over. Back next week. Yeah. Thanks, Claire. Bye. Total respect. Yeah. Nice one. Keep it real. See?",
