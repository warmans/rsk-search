  "text": "Placebo. The Bitter End. That's the first single to be lifted from their forthcoming album Sleeping With Ghosts, which you can hear in full on the XFM online listening posts. I'm Ricky, your cheeky little devil. Gervais, with me, Steve. All right, ladies, what can I get you to drink? What? I think I'm made of money. I meant half a mile to some at Merchant and Carl. Oh, I'm stressed. I'm stressed. If it's too hard, I don't want to do it. Pilkington. Indeed. Oh, well, it's nice to be back. Rick. Rick. I heard a rumor that you. You weren't gonna be playing great music today. I'm assuming that's wrong. It is wrong. This is what I mean about the, the, the, the grapevine and just Chinese Whispers. I'm not having it. There's some great music coming up. Right. I heard that there was going to be some boring chat. Sorry, is that. Well, I want, I want names. I mean, I don't want to name it, but that's the gossip. I heard totally wrong. I thought it was going to be inane, ill thought out often stupid. No, Carl's not going to talk so much this week. We're going to try and sort of bring, you know, bring it back to real. That's an absolute lie. Yeah, yeah. Great, great, great, great, Great week. Yeah, not bad. Have you. It's going hardly now, aren't you? Well, I will be doing later. Tell you about that later on. What? There's a hook. Can I just check? Because there are rules in place, aren't there? Yeah, there was a big. There was a big bust up in the week. I'm only allowed to wind him up. I am not allowed to wind them up socially now. I'm not allowed to. What am I not allowed to do socially? I think squeezing the head socially has been crossed off. Right, okay. I agreed to that because it got to a head where, you know, Carl was really upset and he was thinking of just giving it, giving it all in, weren't you? Yeah, yeah. Why was that? Because he was just winding me up too much. Yeah. I mean, do you want to bring it all up again? I don't mind. What was I doing? It was, it was just. I mean, I should say now that there was a conversation where it was all. We were all sort of really walking on eggshells. It was frosty. It was a conference call and Carl was on one end. And I'll tell you, it was very much a media. I was very much a un Mediator. It was difficult to sort of keep it serious when I'm saying stuff like, I'm sick of you putting a Burger King bag on my head. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. There's a part of me that's like, I can't believe we're doing this. What I like about it is that I'm laughing and going, well, I won't do that anymore. He's going, you can still do it on air. And like today I was gonna. I came in, I went to Squeeze Z, he went at 1:00. I love those rules. I love between the hours of 1 and 3 on a Saturday. You can squeeze his head. You can put a boot button down white. It's terrible. Oh, dear. It all started last week as well. Really? Because I got in a bit earlier to do an edit for you on some track that had swearing in it. Right. So get in early. He comes in, first thing he does is go to sort of squeeze me head. And my reaction was, not now, do it later. As if it's all right to do it later. So that's kind of what made me think, this isn't normal. We should just point out when we say squeezing your head, what exactly does that mean? I put my hand on the front. I do two experiments, Right. One is the side, because you can crush an egg sideways, so I think that's more dangerous. And I squeeze. I actually put my elbows out and I pressed like a vice and I really go for it until it really hurts. And the front one is it shouldn't hurt so much if I'm. If my experiment's right. I don't know. Well, it was all this. That sort of, you know, built up. Sure. And the research that you're doing there, Rick, is that going to be available online at some point? Well, that was the problem. That's what I was saying to him because it kind of started last week. Well, it's been going on since we've known you, hasn't it, really? Yeah, but it's. I just upped it. I just upped it last. It got out of hand a bit. I looked it to when I. I think it got to ahead on Thursday when I filmed it. That was it. Yeah, that's right. I brought in a cameraman to film me torturing him. And there was some people from the sixth floor being shown around. Yeah, some management and that. Showing probably clients round, you know, sort of. They've probably been on all the different floors. Same with all the different radio stations. You've seen Dr. Fox? This is XFM, the sort of Ulta. This sort of noise going on. Yeah. You see them all look down. I'm saying, don't do that. Right, sure. They might want to spend a load of money. Ye. And he's doing that. He's wrestling with me. He's filming it. So that's when I just thought, you know, and then when. When we're having the argument on the phone, I was saying, you know, has this been some sort of experiment? He said that and of course I lost it. Yeah, but it's all. It's all good now. Do you want to squeeze his head before we play the next game? I won't at the moment because, I mean, we've got to get on. It's not. It's not right. And that annoyed me as well, because I was trying to find out where he was going. I was filming him. I was going, I'm waiting for Carl. Told Johnny he's meeting a mate at six, so. Which annoys me on two counts. And I'm just doing the came, you know, so I'm gonna. I'm gonna follow him and just turn up and go, all right, where you been? But then when I came and he went, I'm meeting a mate, and he told me where it was. So I told him. That spoils my fun, of course, because. You'D want to just try him back. Yeah, I don't want. I don't want him to like it. Yeah. Which is. So it's sort of taken. Pulled the rug under my carpet now that he's gonna let me. Do you know what I mean? It's just. It's a little bit annoying. It's that thing, though, you see, this happened years ago to me, right. When, you know, you get pally with someone and then you wind each other up and then there comes a time when you just go over the line. Yeah, Right. What happened? Well, it was this lad called Anthony, right, who was me mate, and we used to sort of always have a. Have a little fight in the toilet and that. Punch each other. Now I want to wipe it. And the punches, you know, used to get harder and stuff. And then, you know, so he hit me harder, turned that into a proper fight. Yeah, I chipped his tooth on the sink. Right, Right. This happened at school and it was time for assembly and I thought, oh, and he's. He's in the toilet crying, go to assembly. There's a. There's police in there in the assembly that day, telling people about unnecessary violence. And you Thought they were there for you. So I'm like, oh, no, Anthony's gonna come in in a minute, like, crying with all blood coming from his mouth. I'm gonna get arrested. Yeah, yeah. Did you go running and sleep? That was an example, yeah. I mean, it kind of happened because I went out with a girl who he fancied. How old are we now? About eight or nine. I think that's out of order. Going out with a mate's girl. Yeah, but she didn't like him. He had, like, big ears and that. He had no chance. No, but do you know what I mean? Alright. I haven't got the looks like I used to. Sure, when you were eight. But that's before the stress of, you know, having head squozed and that sort of thing. I have aged a lot since having your head squished. I love your own grammar. I know. Is that. That's the past tense, is it? Yeah. Squeeze or to have squeezed. Oh, he did squo his head, yeah. Oh, brilliant. So, you know, what about a bit of bowie? Let's be my wife, Carl. I'm asking you. I think we can squeeze that in. Be my wife, Carl. Come on. We miss me on holiday. No, really? No. What? He's joking, I assume, Steve. Well, I don't know. Can you tell? I can't tell whether he's serious or not. What do you mean? No, no, definitely not. I mean, I might. When I get back, I'll go, oh, just have a quick chat. But I'm not gonna be sat there going, oh, I wish I was back in London for Ricky to. You know, we've sorted the ad problem out. Yeah. No, I still won't. No. Okay, well, that's still what I'm saying. I was with Carl in the week. I think it was Tuesday or Wednesday. And was it last week? There was a program on about the child who was older than her mum. The child that was older than her mum. Yeah. Right. Which was. He was looking forward to as much as Oliver. The. The Humanzi. Humanzi, yeah. Yeah. And I didn't see it in the end. Did you miss it as well? And what it is is this a little. She's got an aging thing. So she. He was telling me about this. It's all from him. He went, what? It is. Right. She's about five. Right. But she's aged, so she's actually 90. Right, right. And I went, oh, God. Really? Went, yeah. And then he went, could she get served in an off license? I went, no. He went, well, that's not fair. What do you mean? He went well, I said she's five years old, she's a five year old girl. He went yeah, but she's got the body of a 90 year old, so. Oh God, let her have a fag. Wouldn'T you Let her have one? Is she? If she asked. Yeah, if you worked in an off license and she wandered in. Right. And so she's 2 foot 6. Well, I don't know because I haven't seen it. I don't know that much about it. Yeah, she's a five year old. It's just an aging process which is a degeneration of the cells. Like what aging is. It's. It. It doesn't mean she grew into a 90 year old woman with a scarf. No, exactly. Around the streets, what did you imagine look like? I don't know. I mean she's aging fast. Yeah. Yes, but it's. It's more to do. It's not. Yes. Yeah, because it was saying that a mum and dad are pretty stressed out about it and I kind of thought well, you'd be forever buying birthday presents. It's not like she's morphing through various ages. My God, look, she's 58 today, 59. We can't keep up. It's not that. It has. Has the same effect as aging on the body so a cellular level, there's a degeneration as quick as if she'd gone through. I don't know. I got this from you, I'm guessing, Carl. It's not like she's watching Top of the Pops one week and she's loving it. Then the next week she's going. I can't understand what they're saying. I remember When I was four and a half, they were real bands. S Club 7 were excellent. But what's this tripe? S club. But if she wants a fag. She's five years old, Carl. But she's got to experience everything in a short spell of time. Do you know what I mean? You've got time to sort of. I think you're thinking of her life like that Fat Boy Slim video where it starts off as something crawling out of the sea and then it evolves really quickly over three minutes. That's not the case, Carl. Her mind isn't. She isn't aging in her mind at the same time. No, she's not living the life, a whole life in like, like, you know, three weeks. It's just her body is. Is degenerating quicker than it should. So if you Worked in odd bins. You wouldn't serve her with a bottle of wine. No, I probably wouldn't. Unless she had some id, which was. Probably cool, isn't it? I said, well, that on top of all her other problems, he wouldn't even give us a glass of. Yeah, a bottle of wine and her. ID wouldn't look right because he's aging all the time. The photo would never match. Yeah, look at my hair there. That was last week. Well, it was 2002. Exactly. We don't know. No, I haven't seen it. So, yeah, maybe we should apologize because that could sound callous and cruel because. I don't know what. I don't know what. The whole. It was just the title. The vibe of the. Yeah, I know. The title that excited me. Like, I'm older than my mum. No, it was. It's the child that's older than her mother. Well, yeah, so that's what that was. Weird. There was some good stuff on in the week. You didn't watch that? Didn't see that. Saw maybe someone have it on video for you. Yeah. If you taped it and, you know, send it in, watch on fast forward. She'd really age then. Imagine that. Whoa. Well, we got some weird stuff to talk about, though. What? Coming up later. What? Darren Brown. Oh, yeah. That was interesting. I know. The fact that the track. We've just talked about him asking me nicely not to squeeze his head when people around. And a girl who ages so quickly she should be served in odd bins. And he goes, but we've got some weird stuff coming up. That's Carl's World. Yeah, that's our song in it, Carl. Leave all this misery behind and it. Turing BREAKS painkiller. That's what I could do. I could sort of give you a little local anesthetic and squeeze your head and see how far it would go before start. Like when I get back off holiday. Oh, dear Rick. I was watching music television this morning just before I came out. I love it. I love it. I kind of agree with Wyclef Jean. Yeah. Just because she dances loco, it don't make her a hoe. No. But I can't help but feel she's not helping a case. I mean, she's there every night, basically getting them out for the lads. I know. For money. I mean, I don't mean that she's a hoe or a whore, as we say. But I can't help but think if you. If you think people are slagging you off, calling you a whore, Get a different job. Because I'll tell you this. You like the money? Yeah, she likes to. She likes easy money. I. I'll say this, if. Well, basically exposing and sort of wobbling around you means tits and ass. Doesn't make you a hoe. What does? I don't know. What does? Look at Carl's head. Just went down there. Just went down. He doesn't like this sort of filter. He's thinking about Maxine. That's her name. Put on your red shoes, Maxine. Oh, is it? Yeah, it's a moving song. What's the horse about at the end? Horse? I've never understood that. Never understood that. Is Wyclef doing all right, is he? I'm always concerned about the Fugees because I heard Lauryn Hill's not her new album's. Apparently not very good. Naz, or whatever his name is. I don't know what's happened to him. He's disappeared off the face of the earth. I got a soft spot for him. Oh, I think he popped up too much. I think it was a bit ubiquitous, jumping up when everyone's, you know. He's a funny bloke as well, Wyclef. He's a lovely guy. He's a good guy. Good luck to all the citizens. Good luck. Good luck to all the. All the lads from the Fugees. Any other bands you're concerned about? Hepburn. What the hell? What has gone wrong with Hepburn? Oh, it does make me worry. It does make me worry. Well, do you want to do some. Give some stuff away? I suppose so. Carl, we could. Yeah, yeah. Set it up. So, what do you think? What is it? What? Which of your many competitions is this? Song's a phrase. Talking of competitions, I remember last week a big argument that Carl kicked Steve off the team because he was getting a little bit uppity and trying to take it over. Pub quiz. Pub quiz. Yeah. But then you let him back in, didn't you? Well, he was all right. He came to me afterwards and said, you know, you're not going to kick me off, are you? I said, well, yeah, he came back sort of, I suppose, begging. He sort of. Was it embarrassing or. Well, no, it's just, you know, he learned his lesson. He realized he's overstepped the mark, like you have this week. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? We've all learned a lesson. Yeah, we've all learned a lesson. But I won the quiz, didn't I? And you didn't. Well, that doesn't matter. The thing Is I won all the money, didn't I? Please bear in mind it's taking part in the counts, Rick. Yeah, sure. I wasn't winding you up in the quiz though, was I? And your all your team was older. Yeah. What's that got to do with it? You've got a collective age, your team of about 300. No, one of them is. Only one of them is actually five, but she just aged a lot. I think when I took the 11 plus we were all around the same age. That's what I mean. Right. Your team was a lot older. What was our average age, would you say? Average age? Probably 30. Right. Yours at least 41. No, definitely. No, definitely. Only two of us were 40 and one and three were about 30. No, rubbish. Yeah. Who's 30? Martin Glenn's. Glenn's about 36. Yeah, yeah. It all helps, doesn't it? And. Yeah, and I was under 30 and. You'Ve got a better general knowledge. Yeah, yeah. We were cheating. We knew more. You just knew more stuff. Yeah. That's not allowed, is it? Proper quiz time. I wasn't winding you up there when I won. I wasn't gloating or anything, was I? No, not at all. When you kept sort of counting it in front of me and like he. Hasn'T got enough cash already. Carl. How much was the prize? I can't say. Maybe gauche. Right. Is that tax free, that money? Yeah, it's a competition, it's a prize. Is that true though? Is that how it works? I think so. Prize money, isn't it? I don't know. Otherwise. Otherwise, I assume you'll be declaring that. Yeah. Will we? Yeah. You'll be paying tax on that. Yeah. Because you know where people. I mean, the taxman could contact you via XFM at any time just to check that if you wanted to. Sure. Okay. Prizes to give away this week. You've excelled yourself again. We've got once again, Scotland Rocks. The very best of Scottish music. Texas Deacon Blue and Jerry Rafferty. Proclaimers are there or not? Don't worry, she's on there as well. Don't worry, it's based on there. I'm just checking to see if mid year and Hu and Gride. Thankfully, I don't know the Rosillos as well. Oh, brilliant, brilliant. That is great. So look forward to that. Is Lulu on there or not? Is she not on there? She's not on there. But the Wets. Are the wets on there? All the Wets or not? Attraction. Brilliant, brilliant. That's on there. So is we Hootie McTooth on there? And is Jamboree. What's this? This is another arbitrary compilation called Strange and Beautiful. The Exist album, which is quite good. The new album by the White Stripes. The DVD Walking with Cavemen. That tv, the show that's on on vhs. It's still got the price on there on vhs, in case you haven't seen it. Fight Club. And the best selling book from Michael Moore, Stupid White Men. So actually some quite good prizes there, Carl. Not bad. All right, Carl, what's this? What's this? Competition. Right. Song's a phrase. It's where I get a line that sort of is said a lot on the show or has been said quite a lot on the show. Yeah. Is this one Stop Squeezing me Head? No. Oh, I could have done that. But what we're doing is the Elephant Man's my favourite film. Is that the phrase? Yeah, that's the phrase that we're looking at today. The Elephant Man's my favorite film. It is as well. It's his favorite film. I know, I know. What is that again? It's funny and sad and it's that you know exactly what you're gonna get. Yeah. They promise you an elephant man. That's exactly what you get. Yeah. Have you seen it, Steve? I have seen it. It is good in it. Yeah. Yeah. Do you remember at the beginning, think. Of that, having that as your favorite film. Of all the hundreds of amazing. I mean, I mean, I mean it's. A good film and it's a moving film. Yeah. But I can't imagine the film I would watch endlessly again and again, care. About a bloke with a elephant again the other night. It's one of them that, you know, just sort of reminds you. You know what annoys me when he. I am not an animal. He is. Well, I mean, he speaks like one. And what does he look like? 1. But it was a bit unfair because they never let him look in a mirror because he's a bit odd looking and it upset him. Yeah. So his hair was always a mess and that made him look worse than he actually was. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But good film. Get it out if you haven't seen it. That's the phrase today. Do you know, my friend introduced me to that film. And if you remember at the beginning, there's a big montage because he is working in a zoo, isn't he? Or he's been kept in a zoo. And there' sequence of various of elephants, I think actual elephants kind of Rampaging. And it's just quite a sort of moody, atmospheric monster. Any king of the elephants. My friend said to me when we watch this, he said, what happens is he gets trampled on by some elephants and that's what makes him look like an elephant. And I went, right, and I watched it, I thought, that's not the case. And I tried to explain it to him. And he's to this day still convinced that the Elephant Man. It's like when Spider man gets bitten by a rejected spider. It was his man, wasn't it? Elephant Man. The power of an elephant. Was it his mom who got. He never forgets. Be careful. Is it his man? What? Wasn't it his mom who was pregnant and then they ran over her and. No, I don't think so. That's the impression I got from it. No. You are joking, aren't you? No, I thought. I honestly. Anyway, right, so the phrase is. My favorite film's the Elephant Man. These five songs make up that. That sentence. Yeah. Right, this week. Have a listen, see if you can work out the songs. Email in ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk right, and you win. All that stuff. Steve just said, so. All right, here we go then. That was mostly done. Genius. Let's hear it again. Five songs there. The Elephant Man. Not so hard. This is my favorite film. Well, I thought we'd make it a bit easier. Make it a bit easier. Just. Just one more. Email over ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk Brilliant. A bit of a hip hop hooray. A bit of a rap classic, although you may not have heard it before. Yeah, I like to send a shout. Out to all the players clubs throughout the world. I know they got a players club in Chicago. Basically, they then go on to give shout outs to lots of players. So we'll end it there. That was rapping for Tay and the song players club from 1994. Still sounds brilliant. It's still hip hopity though, isn't it? It is indeed, Rick. Let's have some adverts. Excellent. Xfm 104.9. I'm looking to raise with me Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl the Cayman Pilkin. Pilkers. Little Pilkers. Little baldy roundy heady Pilkers. Oh, yeah, there's gone. There's a what's her name? If people go to the website, there's not a what's her name, an actual what's it. You are joking, Carl. No, it's just you reminded me Little round bottle there. Yeah. If they go to. Xfm.co.uk yeah. Ricky, there's a picture on there. You know that picture you did? Oh, that. I drew the one you drew with me. Open it. On what? Xfm. Put it on. Yeah. Did it look good? Can you get into it? I'll have a look. Yeah, I'll have a look. What is it? Xfm.co.uk Ricky. Right. And there's that little picture and people can sort of put bids in and then the money goes to me, I. Assume, as I drew it. No, it's for some charity thing, so. Because I. I've read. I read something. I think there's been a bit of at least £50, which is pretty. No, there hasn't. Got. I just saw it earlier. I deleted it because I thought someone was winding us up. You deleted it? Well, I didn't know, did. I? Didn't really. You didn't keep me informed. Well, it just. Oh, he's a buffoon, Carl, isn't he? I think. I think you're an idiot, but sometimes. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just gonna check. Just gonna check. The power list. Top hundred most important people in radio. What's this list? Oh, it's just the most important people in radio. Oh, 56. Ricky Gervais. That's annoying. 56. Let me see. So there's 55 more important people than me. I love the fact there that I've beaten David Mansfield. He's a controller of capital. Yeah. Arbitrary. The Radio Academy Power is the top 100 and you're what, number 56, Ricky Gervais, XFM. I notice we're not mentioned, Carl. What's your thoughts on that? You know, little stinging there. I just thought, considering the amount of work you put into this show. Don't get me started. Are you on here elsewhere, Carl? No, too busy. Chris Moyles is number 96. Oh, that's good. That's good news, isn't it? He'll be off the list by next year, I hope. Go on. Right, who's number one? Number one is Phil Roberts. I don't know who that is. Right. Wouldn't you think that Marconi would have got a mention? Marconi. Now, what station's he on? That's the point, because I got one in television. You thought John Logie Baird would have got a mention? Yeah. That's great. Although it's not ever, is it? It again. I'll slip out of that by next year, I'd have thought. Oh, dear. Just checking to see. Oh, yeah. Dr. Fox. Good. He's on there at number 39. I'm assuming his medical qualifications have also. Yeah, that sneaks him up the list. Yeah. Typical Pete waterman. Yeah. Number 35. That makes sense. Important guy. Can we just give them the website so they can read this at the Ledger? Because this really isn't radio, is it? All right, well. Xfm.co.uk no, that website, if they want to see the most. I don't know where it is. I'm just saying. Xfm.co.uk Tricky if you want to see that picture. And whoever bidded 50 quid, if you can send the email again. Whoever bid. Whoever bidded. We should start picking you up on your grammar. I mean, we're hardly ones to speak, but, you know, I squished. I. I'll tell you what, I listened back to Lutons. Carl was worried about last week's show because he said there was too much screaming and shouting and. And just nonsense and eating. It was a bit like, it's a knockout last week. No. Yeah. And I listened back to it and. And it was without doubt the most appalling piece of radio I have ever heard in my life. Really? I didn't know what I was saying. I was in set and said, eat it, eat it. And he's going, you're going, carl, they're eating a hamburger. It was bizarre. Just half an hour. If anyone didn't know us or I'd never heard, it was just like going, heart144.xfm144. Listen to this burger. Eat the bass. Go. Coming out. As bad as it was, Absolutely. Honestly, it was like a mental ward. To be fair, though, at the best of times, you sound like you're setting the evening standard. Oh, God. Oh, we should have the worst bits available, should we? Just the worst bits of broadcasting ever. So where. Where I didn't finish the sentence or it was just shouting or a record. What? I mean, it was swear word slips out and just put them all on a cd like, you know, like Pinky put out the rest of his phone calls. Exactly. Yeah. I haven't got that. The greatest radio show in the world ever. Yeah. Now that's what I call bollocks. Calm down. That's just cheapened it. Oh, no. Player record. All tits. Good to see those boys still rocking. That's AC DC. He shook me all night long on XFM 104.9. I'm looking, James, with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. We got the results of the quiz. Carl. Yeah, I'LL just play it one more time. It was Songs of Phrase. Is this the last time we're doing this? I thought so. I thought it worked better this week because it was actually doable. Yeah, I think that makes a difference, Carl. We haven't done Carl's an Idiot yet. Carl, you're an idiot. Have we? Oh, that's a reason to keep it. Maybe we can end with that one when you come back. Right, well, the five songs that made up this little thing here was Mysteries, Beautiful Blues, Eels, Innocent Man, Billy Joel in My Favorite Waste of Time, Owen, Paul Boehm, Rhapsody, Queen, Girls on Film, Durand Duran. It sounded like this. Elephant Man. He's my favorite. The Elephant man is my favorite film. Hang on, was Bohemian Rhapsody in there? Yeah, he is this, though, right? Yeah. Well, we're gonna give that to Piley. He just calls himself Piley. Ian Pyle. Good work, Piley. What's happened to Anders? Well, I was just gonna say, actually, we've not had correspondence from Richard Dickey Anders for some time. The Dick meister Dickmeister General is naughty, Insulting ways. Yeah, Anderson used to email regularly. If you're listening, get on your computer. Get in touch, mate. Why don't you tell us what you. Think of the show? Hold on, though. To be fair, he was listening when we were pretty shoddy. If he's listened to the last three weeks, I think we're owed a little apology from you, Dickster. Exactly. Absolutely. Listen, Piley, we want to send you all those goodies, including Scottish rock, but we don't have your address, so email in your address and we can send it off to you. All right? Yeah. More adverts. Yeah. There's Snoop, beautiful XFM104, 4.9, Gervais Merchant Pilkington. Carl had a treat in the week, didn't he? He couldn't believe his luck. We know Darren Brown. You know Darren Brown, the. The sort of magician, mind reader fella. It's more special than that. Well, called me up in town, said, do you mind for a break we bring along Kyle. He went, pleasure. Carl's very cynical, saying, well, he won't get into my head. Yep, Great, wasn't it? It was brilliant. He went, can I ask him questions? I went, well, no, he's social. He went, I'm not coming. I went, well. Well, I asked him, I want him. No, he did that trick when he said, you've got the winning ticket. I went, don't. It was not gonna tell you. He's a magician. He went, well, it's not worth it then if I can't quiz him. But he came along. I still did though, didn't I? Got, got in there with the questions other people wanted to know about. Yeah, yeah, go on. What did you ask him and what'd you find out? I said, how do you do that? I love the fact that the first half hour, me, Steve and Derren Brown were convincing Carl that he didn't see a ghost when he was five. Yeah. And then we got onto the tricks. Yeah, well, you, I mean, it will live in my mind. He won't get inside my head. Yeah. And he got inside your head magnificently, Carl, didn't he? I mean, were you not amazed? I mean we. Darren promised actually that he would come on the show in the future and then you, the listeners can see how he can baffle, amaze and just generally freak out. I think we should film everything that happens, Right. Because it's just a waste because you're only getting half it when you hear what Carl has to say because his face honestly says a thousand words. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? It's just. I think we should film it and just put it on a DVD of Carl's facial expressions. This is Carl thinking he saw a ghost. This is Carl thinking they were going to clone a man moth. Yeah. It's just different faces. So do you want to try and explain what he did and what marvel do so much? Right, yeah. He comes in, he sits down. I'm a bit, sort of, bit skeptical straight away. You're spooked by him straight away. Yeah. There's a weird thing about him. So anyway, he sat there and I'm watching him because he was naked, checking, you know, seeing, seeing what he's, you know, looking at and stuff. So. So anyway, he gets his, gets his paper out and I think, right, he's gonna do a bit of trickery in that. And he says to me, right, write down a number and a name, Right? It was between a two digit number, a two digit number and a name of anyone, you know. Yeah. Right. Now the thing is, I thought the name because I was telling Steve earlier about the, about the kid at school who I fell out with right, over that, that girl who was called Aris. Yeah. So that name was like in my mind ready to go because I didn't want to use anybody's name who were new sort of now because maybe you've mentioned it in the past. So I mean, I couldn't say Suzanne. I knew anyway. Yeah, yeah. Well, do you know what I mean? So I picked a name. Yeah, well, I thought you might have been thinking about Antinora, so I picked this name, right, that you three didn't really know about. Right. Number just came to mind. Right. So 42. We were never thinking 42. 42. Right. He said, right, just keep saying it over and over in your. And I'm there and he's saying all these sort of different numbers at me and I'm trying to throw him off a little bit. Every time he said a number that was nothing like 42, sort of smiling, looking a bit nervous. Yeah. Don't know if you caught that. Right. I just. All I could see was you looking sort of blank. When he said, let your mind go blank. He'd realize he picked on the wrong person then. So you had to squeeze his head to get it going again. I said, I said, so Darren, if in doubt, he'll be thinking of monkeys. And. And Darren looked at Carl and he said, were you thinking of monkeys? He said, I tried not to. And I thought of them. All. Right, that's true as well. Yeah. Right, so. So I'm there, I'm there thinking of these numbers and that. And he's. Then he said, right, let's just talk about other stuff for a bit. Right. So I was like, well, I'm not going to say anything. Yeah, right. Because I don't want you to catch me out. But then when we were talking, I was trying to like, knock him off track. I mean, I wasn't. Oh, do you know what I mean? I played a bit ball with him. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was like, say, because we were talking about aliens and that as well, weren't we? And I was saying, well, you know, they might come and land again in 2060. Clever. You know, I mean, dropping in different numbers and that. And so doing all that playing on his own game. And I think I had him for a bit on the road. Yeah. So anyway, comes down to the, the time when he's telling me that the name and the number. Yeah. And will they explain what he actually did? I mean, that was. He just went, he said, just think of a number at the end of it. And. And he said, oh, is it an I? And you went, it wasn't an I, but there is no. Okay. And anyway, he got, he got, he got the name Harris. Then he went, he went and said, are you an extrovert? And he wrote down these numbers. Yeah, he. He wrote down some numbers and he said that if you're an extrovert, these are the Numbers you tend to choose. If you're an introvert, these are the numbers you tend to choose. And he wrote them down and he said, I don't think you're really an introvert. I don't think you're this, I don't think you're that. And I think he came up with the number 32, didn't he said to you, you're thinking number 32. You said to him, no way. You couldn't believe your luck, could you, when you'd caught him out. But he said. He said it's either 42 or 32, didn't he? Yeah, well, no, but that it was beside the point because then he said, you know, rather brilliantly, if. Hang on a minute. If you just add up these numbers here, that adds up to 42. It was a magic square, numbers. That's 42, that's 42. I got diagonally there. That box is 42. The numbers that added up on the page, whether you go across, sideways, down, across, whatever, always added up to 42. Yeah, yeah. Right. Which. And he's got the name Harris, which freaks you out. It freaked me out. I kept saying to him, how do you do it? How do you do it? And he wasn't telling me. I was talking to people at work about him and one lad said, apparently the trick that he uses is the same thing that Hitler did. Play record. No, no, seriously, just apparently it's the same thing because he was saying, what? Play record. No, just let me finish. Because now I've even ran it by other people to check if I'm on. This true player record. And come. Because the people in the XFM office. Yeah, I mean, they're pretty wise. They're up on that stuff. No, he used it in a different way. Me Play Record. No, hang on, let me hear. It is. It's power of suggestion, apparently. And when Hitler used to do his big speeches to people. Yeah, as well. Supposed to be. Play. Come on, finish, finish. Well, that's. That's about it. Ian Canfield, a few different people. All right, the big. Yeah, the big thinkers out there, the brain boxes. But anyway, right, it's because. I mean, Magnus Magnuson works sonic, so now, doesn't he? All right, what was the PAX one? Was it Jason that blew me away, right, that. The fact that he got the name, he got the number. Spooky bit. All right, I'm walking home. I called you up a couple of times and I left a message on your phone because it was just amazing. Not only was he Good at magic. But his maths was brilliant. That thing adding up to 42 was like, how did he do that? I mean, we didn't even make a big deal. He said that to me. He said, all Carol Vorderman's got is the maths. Yeah. I mean, imagine him on Countdown. Yeah. He didn't even know what they were going to write down, you know what I mean? So a bit of a wasted talent. I should see him again about that. He asked him, he said, damn. I said, why are you doing it on mucking around on telly? Then he went, sorry, why are you mocking iron on telly? Yeah. He said, you could make some serious money. I think Steve went, well, he does all right. He went, nah. But he did that, the ticket thing all day. Yeah, but didn't you say to him, you should be working for the police force? I said, yeah, he should be in a police station. He could help people out. I mean, it's not a daft idea, is it? Not really. Right. So anyway, right, so I get home still, I'm calling different people up. Walking home, I couldn't believe it. Yeah. I called Suzanne up, telling her about it and she's like, slow down. She's like a little kid who's just been on a fairground ride or something. Yeah, yeah, slow down. All right. So I'm telling her, call me mom and dad up. My dad wasn't that impressed. No, of course she's like, well, it's all been done before. But then he wasn't impressed with little Donkey, was he? He's not impressed by much as he go. So I get in. He probably had to nip out down. To the phone box, Right. Do some thieving. Yeah, yeah. We've forgotten bread. No, I'm just going on the phone box. So. So. So I get into my flat, right, and what they flat where I live, they put the post in, like, these little pigeon holes, right? And I don't normally check them out. I'll leave it for Tuzan to do. Right, sure. But this time, for some weird reason, I thought, right, I'll. I'll check it, see if we've got any post. Open it up. There's only this. A letter for Ms. Harris. Yep, there it is. Bonafide in front of us, a letter addressed to a Ms. Harris. Well, does she live there? No, it's my address. She doesn't live there. Did she ever? Dunno. It doesn't matter. It's weird, innit? But we've never had. Normally. I think there was a Guy who lived there called Yaki Shoki. Mr. 42. It was definitely wasn't an arist. Right. This is the first time we've had a letter for this woman. Yes. Right, but what are you claiming? Because Darren Brown himself admits that it is not paranormal. It is not supernatural. It is a trick. It's a trick. But he would say that, wouldn't he? Hitler said that. Play a record. Well, can we open this? No, it's illegal. No, but I'm thinking if it's for someone's like, 42nd birthday, you can't open that letter. Go and put it back. Or put not. No, you cannot open that letter. Why not? It's. You can't open someone else's mail because you think Derren Brown's supernatural. What if we steamed it open, then resealed it? No one would know. It's only a letter. You can't. Well, yeah, you can, but I don't want any part of it. Carl, I think you should open it. No, you open it. I'm not opening it. It's against the law. You should open it, though. No, we won't open it. Then they won't send you to prison. Look, forget it. You'll get off Cure. There's no cure. I'm looking. What? I'm tempted to open it. Do you want to steak? There you go. No, I'm not. I'm not gonna open it. But I think you should. Definitely. Six Different Ways by the Cure from the album the Head on the Door. We've enjoyed that. The head on the door, Carl. Oh. Bit of a coincidence. It was only four weeks ago you were talking about a head and a door. Exactly. Got a number on it. Oh, dear. So we're not opening it? No, I can't open it because as the producer, Right? Oh, yeah, because you're standing in society as such. That they'd make a real example of you. Yeah. A producer of a tin pot radio show. Once a week. Yeah. He should know better. He can press buttons and talk at the same time. Send him down. That You. They wouldn't try you in an adult court. You would get away. Get away with it. Just. They'd hear you speaking for a little while and they would. They would. That the judge would end up squeezing your head and letting you off. It'd be like those people who train monkeys to break in. Do you remember down in South London we talked about in the past and they were going around robbing stuff and they trained them to do it. Yeah. I didn't think those monkeys Would have got in trouble. It would have been the keepers. So, you know, I think XFM would probably take the wrap. Will you open it? No, I can't be seen to open. Open it. No, he's a writer. Director. Exactly. So am I. I can't be seen to open it. I'll give it here then. Right. I'm having no part of this. That's against the law, but. Right. I'm having no part of it. Open it. Come on. You started now, Right. The thing is, right, if it's important, we can say. Maybe she's listening, but. Do you need distress? What? It could be anything. What are you going to say? We're going to say. Oh, and if you are listening, Ms. Harris, you have got gonorrhea. Call the clinic. Do you know what I mean? It could be anything in. Oh, dear. Oh, well, I think. I think my talk did. Well. What? What is it? It's the number 42 on there. What is it? Can you say, Be careful. What? Let me see what it is. What is it? Dear sir, madam, your periodical dental inspection is now to you. Would you kindly contact the surgery to make an appointment? Harris. Mrs. Harris, if you're listening. Listening. Your periodical dental inspection is now due. You'd like to. You might want to contact the. Yeah, but the dental surgeon that you normally go to, she's got. Could have a faulty tooth. Faulty tooth? 40 tooth. I don't believe it. 42. Oh, my God. God, that Darren's good. Darren Brown's good, isn't it? Oh, dear. Some blur. Carl, is that really seven and a half years old? Blur? The universal. All right. Yeah. Just make me think. Sure. Carl, I asked you in the week, didn't I? How old was that kid when that was out? She wasn't born, so she was about 30. Oh, well, I think that's the first time we've officially broken the law on it. What? I don't think we've broken the law before on air. Are you all right with the dentist appointment? Well, we haven't broken the law, Steve. He has. You're right. Yeah, we're fine. And he should know better. He's a top producer of a tin pot radio station. Carl, Ricky and I were doing some writing in the week. We needed a little. Get a little book of zodiac types. What's your thought on. Just to make sure it was good luck, you know, to be writing. Yeah, yeah. What do you make of all that stuff? Horoscopes. Do you. Do you have any thoughts on that now and again? I'll Read it. But sure, I'll believe it if it's good. Yeah. If it's not, just go, what star sign are you? That's perfect though, that. But that is, that. That's that raison d'etre that is those people who. Do zodiacs exist on that piece of philosophy. Yeah, I'll believe it if it's good. Exactly. And that's why when you have breakdowns, people don't go, you're a nasty little piece of work. You're a pug, ugly little twat. And you're never amount or anything. It's things like you're probably too generous for your own good. Yeah, you, you like to be a bit of a distance, but you like to love. You're a warm person. It's always, always stuff like that, isn't it? People go, I suppose I am too. Yeah. Yeah. That is me all over. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? You're a creative person. Person who thinks they're not a creative person. Exactly. You've got a wonderful sense of humor. Yeah. What. What starts on you. Mine changes. I'm on the edge. Right, okay. Even makes that complicated. It even makes twaddle complicated. No, I'm just, I'm just. It changes depending what paper you read. Yeah. All right. 23Rd of September. So I think most of the time I'm a Virgo, I think. Oh, well, I'll tell you, write that. Down now, listeners, 23rd of September. And come around and give him the bumps. What? I mean, well, according to this. I mean it. I. I mean, you've been criticizing this, Rick. Sure. You've been saying that there's maybe not, not anything in the Z. Hang on, let me just read. Is this going to change my mind? Am I going to eat my words? The typical Virgoan words. Okay. The physical appearance of the typical Virgoan. Yeah. High forehead. That's not true. Cranium may seem too big in comparison with the face. Look at Carl. Look at Carl. But how specific is that? Has an extremely large forehead, has a high hairline. That's not true though, is it? Maybe quite tall. What are the blokes like? Often has one foot turned in more than the other. What? They've just described Rain Man. What is that? How can I be specific? Well, that's why it sounds like Carl. One foot turned in. Yeah. Oh, have they even bothered doing one for you? Because there isn't many people. Hang on a minute. Let him finish. Stick. No, I'm just saying. Go on, what are you saying? I sort of think I'm fairly average looking. But I'm saying have they wasted a page in that book for whatever you are? It started off me being dissing him and stuff and you've been nice. Hang on a minute. I don't think you can be a Virgoan because it says that they are normally quick, alert and intelligent. But. No, actually I have to say it says here behavior and personality traits of the Virgoan as a child is an excellent mimic. Can learn many things in a short time. Not really sure if you is it rarely questions authority, but frequently questions facts. You never question facts. Yeah. You never question authority. Scared of authority. Yeah. Yeah. Your usual time is very upset if teased. That's true. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. Can't take a bit of stick. Too much pressure. If you can't stand the heat, guard the kitchen. Yeah. What to teach a young Virgoan. Myths, fairy stories, make believe daydreams and how to use imagination should all be taught to young virgoan so they have plenty of magical moments to remember in their adult years when they are often alone. I'm changing my mind. I know. This is good stuff. This is really good stuff. All right, well, let's see. What are you. Well, I don't think we should talk about that. Yeah, let's have a look. It says that we're going. I love some of the specifics of this. Vergone is an employer. He's excellent as the boss of a small company. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't get him on a Tuesday. It's probably stamp collecting then. Yeah, he loves a bit of hadock. Okay, let me look at mine. Oh, that is good though, Carl. Is it? That is you all over. I've changed your mind. It's brilliant. It's a real science. They've really put their work in with this one. Let me see. Sagittarius. Sarah Jones. Sagittarian is a happy, playful little clown. Little greets everyone. Oh dear. Yeah, yeah. Let me see. Sagittarius at home. He's only going to read the good bits though, ain't he? If that's it. What? What could it say? Have they done yours in sort of small print because you've got special eyes. I don't know what that insult is, Carl. What kind of an insult is that? Well, he's happy with that. Look at his face. Who's done me oh dear to me. Back together little baby bird on XFM 104.9. Gervais Merchant Pilkington. Gervais, you're cancer is that right? Yeah. Just looking you up in the little zodiac book. Sure. Again, I've really changed my view. I used to dismiss these out of hand. These are bang on about. You may have remarkable teeth. Perhaps prominent, irregular, or in some way unusual. You have got quite strange teeth. Who doesn't know when they're English? Even if slim, may appear broad or plump. Plump, maybe. Plump. Or tend to put on weight very easily. Yeah, correct. Yeah. Behavior and personality traits. Loves delicious food and drinks, but almost always dribbles, even when past baby. How specific is that? It's true of you, though. You know what that is? Because I was born at a certain time of year and that's what happens. I tend to dribble. Yeah, well, no, that is fair enough. I think it starts to fall apart, though. Why? It says intelligent, handsome. No, no, it just says takes work seriously and does not like frivolity. I mean, a man who spends most of his time squeezing people's heads and struggling them to the floor. I did squeeze his head. I squozed his head many, many times. Although it does say that you. It says about your loves and your loves and hates, your likes and dislikes. You apparently, like anyone who loves his or her mother. Mother. So specific, please. It won't do. Listen to the Gallagher boys and stop crying your heart out. On XFM 104.9. No need to. It's monkey news. So now's your time. Time for monkey news. Can we have the J jingle? Oh, chimpanzee that monkey news. I love the jingle. Right, well, can we say that jingle once more? Yeah, let me queue it up. Oh, chimpanzee that monkey news. Oh, it's brilliant. Got a lot to live up to now. I'll be honest with you. Often that jingle is more fun than the monkey. Yeah. So you gotta excel yourself this week. Well, it's. There's been a lot going on in the monkey world. Yeah. I was looking at the. The Guinness Book of Records that we bought last week. What you bought? What that I bought? Is it still wet? Ours was cleaning the tea off it. I was having a. Having a little read through and there was some monkey stuff in there. There was. This isn't the actual story. I'm just telling you. Yeah. What it's like looking up monkey news all week. It's like behind the scenes. It's like the Making of Monkey News, which is actually available on DVD. It's, you know, 12 minutes unseen footage. Just the making of Monkey news, which is my favorite bit, in a way. If you enjoy monkey News. See how it happens. See, you know, from conception to. So it's all put together. Yeah, go on. Yeah. What's a typical monkey news day? Well, it was. There's some stuff about a monkey in the Guinness Book of Records, I think it. It had the record for asking for a cup of coffee in 23 different ways. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. That's good. Just to show the monkey news is getting bigger and people are covering it. Donald McIntyre, he was on BBC on Monday. He was on Channel 5, wasn't he? No, no, he hasn't moved over yet. This is something that he did for the BBC. Right. So that was pretty good. That was about. Well, it wasn't good. It's pretty. Pretty sad really. What he was doing this thing. Do you know, like last week we were doing Cheap as Chimps. Yeah. And someone emailed in saying, you know, Donald McIntyre's doing cheapest chimps. Really? And it was about. I bet he wasn't. I bet Donald McIntyre did not do a program called Cheap as Chimps title. No. But you could tell where they'd got the format from. Sure. I mean, sure. And it was. It was about gorillas and how much you can get one for. But the problem was because they're that pricey, they were sort of. I mean, I don't even want. If it's cool, then don't. Yeah, forget it. Yeah, it wasn't a bit. Okay. I mean, in, say, in the making of monkey news and cheapest chimps. Not. Not anyone's harmed. There's no monkeys. No. Go on. All right, well, anyway, today's. Today's story. Z nailed in. So you didn't even do anything towards it. So when you say, I've been working on monkey news, what, you. You printed that out? So is the making of monkey news you checking your email? Well, I'm always looking at different options. You know how much is going on. This one makes me laugh when he says he's really busy. Yeah, I'm doing other stuff. And I'm doing other stuff. People are sending in monkey news. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You get an email. Is it from Reuters? Well, listen, it's from Steve. Okay. Now what it is is this monkey, right? Yeah. Don't know where it was, but there's a bit before the monkey anyway, right. Is this. No, listen, shoot me, right? It's a bank. There's this bank, right. Busy bank, normal day, everything's going normal, Right. Busy bank. People going in, doing what they do seeing about mortgages and stuff. Y. Everything's normal, everyone's happy. Right. So anyway, it's quite busy. One day, fella comes in with a gun and a balaclava on absolute good. Well, I'll tell you now, Kyle, if this fella turns out to be any ape or monkey related species, you're never doing this again. You'd never. So just. If you want to finish it, it's at your own risk. But. But if this fella who robbed the bank turns out to be a chimpanzee, that's the end of monkey news. Okay, let's hear the end. It's a lovely day in a lovely bank. Everyone's happy, everything's normal. The man comes in. In the balaclava. Man comes in. Is it a man starts waving a gun around. Let me finish the story. Starts waving a gun around. Yeah. Right up to no good. So everyone's singing. Oh, God, you know, wishing didn't come in here. It's not going to be a good day. Or how tall is the man? Shut up. Let's hear it. Everything you know. Oh, God. He's telling everyone to get down on the floor. Y. In English. In English? Yeah. You think so? Yeah. So everyone's panicking. Everyone's getting on the floor, thinking, this is it. This is, you know, it's all over. Yeah. Just when you think, you know, it could. It's all bad news. It's all bad news. Doors swing open, happen. Little monkey wanders in. God, it's worse. Shut up, Rick. Little monkey wanders in, right? The robber's like, what's going on here? He's telling it to get down on the floor. I don't think it was taking any notice. No, it was just busy asking for coffee. It runs in. I don't know if it was gonna withdraw or deposit or whatever. It wanders in, right? Goes up to the robber. Where did it. Where did it come from? Shut up, will you? Let him finish the story and then ask questions. That's only fair. Okay. Wanders in, runs up to the fellow with the gun, takes the gun and the bag of money off him. Everyone's like, yay, you know, we've been saved. Then the monkey starts backing out with the gun and the money. Shut up. Sit down. Sit down. I'm having this. It does a runner with the. With the money and the gun. No one's seen it since. You are an idiot. I mean, you are. You have said some stupid things in your time. What are you talking about? It's a story that happened. No, what are you talking about? What do you mean it backed out? It came in. Whether was it as an accomplice, was it an opportunist monkey robbery? What are you talking. Think, Carl, think. I know, it's mad. That's the idea of Monkey News. We're telling people how, like, our monkeys are pretty, you know, they're mental, they're. Up to no good. What do you think? They've never seen the monkey since. Why do you have a getaway car waiting? Did he swing his way to freedom? Where was this? There's no details. Don't talk rubbish. Well, Steve, Steve emailed it in, he's got it off the net. And the funny thing is. Yeah, the funny thing is it wasn't just him who sent it. I had that a couple of times. So a few people obviously read the story and said, you know, that'll be good for Monkey News. It doesn't say anymore. It doesn't say if he went off to Spain. It doesn't say, you know what, you know, if he's on Crime watch. Doesn't say any of that. It's just saying that's what he did. That's the story. And that's what Monkey News. I've heard that they're making a movie version with Phil Collins, so I look forward to that. And Judy Waters. So that's. That's this week's Monkey News. If you've got any, you know. No, don't bother. That's the end. No, that is the end. End. That's the end of Monkey News. No more Monkey News. This is bit Queen. It says it here in this email, Rick. It's got to be true. Right, 17 to 1. That's for you, Carl. Cuz you're going on holiday. Do like to be beside seven Cs arrived by Queen. Rick, we've had an email from number one fan Richard Anderson. Oh, I'm opening it. I haven't read it. Loving it, isn't he? What does he say? Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well. He likes it. He's from Richard Anderson. It pains me to admit it, but your show is no longer appalling. Go on. Congratulations on being only slightly rubbish. Excellent. Jeez. Hey, we're winning him round. Yeah. I'll tell you what he love though. I know what he's a big fan of. Well, yeah, excellent. Nice. Through that one again. Always Metal Mickey Suede on XFM 104.9. Wow. Nearly over with Ricky, Steve and Carl. I've done another Little sketch for you, Carl, because I was excited by the fact that we raised that money. So I've done. Well, it's not. It's not over yet. It's like people go to the website and if they think it's worth More than 50, they can say, I'll give you 55 or something. Put that little one on. It's all three of us in it. Well, they haven't done that yet. No, but they could put that on next week and they can frame it for them, can't they? If they have a look. A look. Xfm.co.uk forward slash. Ricky can have a look at it if you want it. Just pay some money and now. It'd be worth a bit of money, won't it? A few years when we're all dead. Now, listen, Carl, you're going on holiday. You need a little rest, don't you? Yeah. What's it. What's the. What's the vibe. What's the vibe of the day? What's the. What's the. Just a crack on holiday. Come on. Where are you going? Madeira. Right, good. It's for Suzanne's dad, Right. My girlfriend's dad. He's 60, so, yeah, that's the average age in Madeira. Yeah. My mate Damo went to Madeira and he was worried about sort of terrorism on the plane. And he looked around, he thought, well, if someone gets up, someone arrest them to the floor. And he really looked around and he was the only one he realized could have got out of his seat quickly enough. So you'll enjoy it. It's quite quiet. It's nice. It'll be all right. I mean, it's the first time a mum and dad have been away, so whatever. Abroad. Yeah. So they're worrying about. They just don't understand the rules and stuff. So they're panicking a bit. And then in the week they're gonna take livestock. Yeah, well, it's getting like that. It was like, are they filling loads of durags with heroin as we speak? No, but do they know about passports expiring? Don't they? I mean, they're not completely stupid. They know about all that, right? Yeah. And he called up in the week, one of the questions said, what's the best thing when you're going abroad? It's the best thing to use to carry tea bags. So it was like, what are you worrying about that for? They'll sell tea bags out there. He's like, well, we want to take our own. He's like, they'll Sell tea bags. Yeah. And he's worrying about that. He's saying, can I put it in a glass jar? So put it in a glass jar. He said, I'll bubble wrap it. So he's bubble wrapping a tea thing. He's just. I mean, it is annoying me a bit because it's meant to be a week off from. From you annoying me and already he's niggling me. But you are easily wound up. You are a very finickety little fussy person. You don't like any. The slightest bit of pressure. See, I thrive on pressure. Working here, working there as well. It's always doing stuff. Monkey News. Oh, yeah, Monkey News. I got an email, read it to on air, it's rubbish. But that's one feature. That's my video and that's all I have to do. I'll tell you what, when I'm away next week, do Monkey News and see what you can find out. All right? Oh, there's a challenge. See what you can do. I've already told them about the Guinness Book of Records one, so you can't use that. Right. We're gonna find the best Monkey News ever. Carl, what was it you said to me about. Because, I mean, the thing is that you don't really like people, do you? That's the truth of it. People annoy you, don't they? They wind you up. Yeah. What was it you said to me about friends? You don't. He doesn't like friends. He doesn't want any more friends. He doesn't want any friends. Is it because one day they'll ask me to album change a tire? Yeah. What was it? It's always hassle. Well, the tire he sits and swings on in his back garden, you mean? It's just they call up, they ask for stuff they want favors doing. Yeah, they. They wanna. They wanna pint. They want to chat to you because they like you. I know. They're a pain in the ass. I. I'll tell you what, Carl, you're better off without a mate. Although, to be fair, Rick, friends like you. Yeah. You're not judging them on me, are you? You're not judging all. Just that they do sort of know. You know, some friends will never touch you around the head or I'll see. You for a week, am I? You should get a little squeezing. I am going to get a little squeezing. Can I come around there and squeeze you? Squeeze him in now. Play the last cheese while we go to. Is that Got the time for records? Quick squeeze. That's the. That's like a Benny Hill slap there on the. Yeah, all right, That's. That's enough of that. Okay, I'm not. Squeeze it, squeeze it. All right, that's it. Excellent. For a week. Yeah. All right. See you next week. See you later. See you, Rick. Have a good holiday. All right, excellent.",
