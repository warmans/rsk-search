Yeah, you'll know her from the Claire Sturgis show. But we know her from our early days on xfm and, you know, we're good friends. It's sort of like old times in it. Carl is. Had a little surprise birthday present. What's the story of this Claire? Because I don't know. Well, you know, I came in on Monday expecting to see his little smiley face as usual, and it's always not here. What do you mean? His girlfriend had surprised him and dragged him off to the Caribbean for a week. Wow. No caner, isn't it? Oh, can it. I mean, I don't know. He likes the Caribbean. He likes the crabs. Yes. I thought he was bored of the Caribbean. I thought he didn't enjoy it last time. No, he loved it, didn't he? No, I don't think he did enjoy the crabs. Tunisia he didn't like. Right. He's been traveling, hasn't he? I know, yeah. He didn't like Tunisia because there's flies the size of matchboxes, of course, and. And midgets in the kitchen. There's nothing wrong with that. Yeah. Midges or midgets? Midgets. Right. It was midgets. He wasn't saying anything bad. He said that there were lots of midgets in there. Lots of midgets in the. And I thought it was. He'd gone away to some sort of like, theme hole. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But no, this is, I think, gran Canaria. All the canaries or whatever, it's. And how old is Carwell? 30. Is he 33, I think. Yeah. Oh, so it was actually a birthday present. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So. But, but, but that's all right. So have you got a competition that you can regale us with? Because obviously Kyle provides a lot on this show. Hold on. We could do White Van Clare. White Van Claire. Yeah. Are you familiar with this? We ask you questions, topical questions. Just getting your opinion, really, on the. The week's news. Okay. Yeah, but, you know, I'm a little bit, you know, a little bit simple. That's right. Just a little bit. You know what? What? I always sit on the fence. Oh, why? Well, don't sit on the fence. The worst thing there was, she was saying I'm a little bit like, you know, liberal you went simple. Yeah, I didn't know. I thought I'm a little bit. What? Coked up, I think. Who knows? It's Sturgis Any be possible. But. But the other thing is with Carl, we didn't know how good value Carl was until we asked him sort of intelligent questions. He looks quite intelligent. Well, this is it. I mean, I don't think we've probed you enough. We don't know what, you know, your views are. Me enough. We don't know what your views are. You know, this is what I'm saying. We don't know where you stand. I mean, don't sit on the fence. This is. This is the new cla. Sturges. Yeah. All right. We're going to find a personality in there. Claire, let's go back to the old days. How about a bit of the Smith? That was beautiful, Rick. Go on. Oh, you've been practicing everything. Smith's Cemetery Gates. It's a lovely tune. Lovely song. There's one bit that worries me about it. It's sort of like a. Like a teacher warning because you must contrive prose and poems and the words you use should be your own. Don't plagiarize or take on loan. It's sort of like. What are you telling us now? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Going. Thanks, Marcia. Yeah. Actually, yeah, that's not mine. That's Wordsworth. Well, I'm going to write my own. Yeah. Yeah. It's weird, isn't it? Queen is dead, though. One of the great. It's not my favorite album. It was voted best album. But this means what I love about Smith. They just seem to get like. The Smiths is just a brilliant name, don't you think? It just captures everything about. Yeah, you know, we've got a thing about Bad. Bad. Yeah. Well, I was watching. I was watching VH1 Classic Smooth last night and I love it. Sade always on. You can always get another bit of shadow. But Foreigner were on and. Well, I don't know which. I can't remember which tune it was, but the album I noticed it came from. Classy album title. Ajean Provocateur. Oh, it makes my skin crawl. From the album. I imagine there's a band called Ajahn Provocateur and they're from Wigan. It's a. It's a girl singer. She's 35 in a tight dress and it's four blokes with ponytails. Exactly. Doing covers. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Here's what they remember, then. They play a wedding. They Go. We're not doing a wedding again. There was people, there was cake being trodden in. Exactly. Children were just sliding across the carcade floor. They weren't listening to the music. Yeah, well, we've got a gig at the Marquee coming up soon. It's endless. Guest list, five quid in. If your band's are Jean Provocateur or Agent Provocateur. Have you ever been in a band called. Yeah, but. But that's gotta be one of them, because it's not. I don't know what that title says. I don't imagine Foreigner. I've got that sense of intrigue and. Well, one of my worst names, but. Okay, but it's the worst. Yeah, let's start. Worst album titles. Okay, I'll kick off with Tapal. Bridge of Spies. Bridge of Spies. Is that the one that featured China in your head? I assume so. I don't think I did too many. Bridge of Spice. Who did this album? Beggar on a Beach of Gold. Beggar on a beach of Gold. It's got the likes of Collins written all over it, but I know it's not very close. Mechanics Mike and the Mechanics. Yeah, of course. I don't know what that means. Good old Mike is a beggar on the beach of gold. Let's look around. There's some money. He's saying. Don't be a tramp. There's. There's some money there, mate. I don't know what it means. I think it means that everyone else is rich, but he's still poor. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, I like it. Yeah. Oh, that's a bit deep for me, Steve. Maybe you just need a little asterisk at the corner and then a little explanation at the bottom of the record. I'm thinking about this. I'm not quite sure what it means. Oh. Chumbawamba. Well, you know what? What can I. Uneasy listening. Yes. I bet it was from the Chumbas. Are they still cracking on? Are they? Because I think they used to live in a squat. They've done about 400 albums, them and the Levelers. Yeah, it was the best. Chamber one brought the levelers. Good question. Thanks for asking that. Yeah. What's the. What's the telephone number, Claire? It's a 087-00-800-1234. Or you can email ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk worst album titles ever. It's like real radio. It's just like Chris Moyles. It is, isn't it? Exactly. Oh, we've Got the big fat guys on the telly, you know, he's kind of cheeky sidekick and my comedy Dave, you're almost as funny as Miles. Fingers crossed. One day. Right, Sturges, you've brought in the record, haven't you? What are you gonna play? Do you know what like a bootleg is, Ricky? Oh, I've stacked a lot of them up on white label. Yeah, go on. Okay, well, no, this is quite good in the. Ian Baker bought in the other day. It's. It's a bit of Dre, a bit of Snoop Dock mixed in with Crowded House. I thought you'd love it. The juxtaposition there is exciting and it sounds. That's true enough. Play it. Smoke D the weather episode. Snoop Dog, Dr. Drake Crows. I love that. Enjoyable. That works for me. Steve, what you think? No, it was nice. She started off all right. We give. Should we give her one more go around? Applause for cl. Yeah, that's brilliant. No, that's excellent, that. I love that. Rick, the. Yeah, the phone. Oh, it's just gone. No, I tell you, the phone board had lit up there. Really. There was a call buzzing through on. Call came through. A call came through on line one and Stu just missed it. Kyle would never have missed that. He knows how valuable they are. I'm sorry, that was probably someone with an amusing album title. I know. I did get one, Steve. I did get one. Do you want to hear it? Yeah, go on. Okay. This is from Al, who says what about this? H to he. Who am the only one. Sorry? H to H E. H E. Who. Am the only one. I don't know what it means. No. Van der Graaff generator. Oh, well, no wonder. That's the thing that you. One of those things at the museum that you wind up and you touch and it makes your hair stand on end. Yeah, that's the scientific thing, innit? I've given up, Steve. Yeah, that didn't really make me laugh either. I'll be honest. I'm thinking that the whole kind of amusing album titles thing, we should abandon. I. I thought that. I said it. Be honest with you. I thought it was easier than this. I mean, Chris Moles makes it work, that kind of crazy comedy. Okay, let's try it. Radio Magic. But obviously, and I don't think our listeners are into that stuff. I just don't think they can be bothered to get to the front. I don't think a lot of them are able. I think a lot of them are, you know. Do you remember when. Do you remember when we spent about three hours trying to get to the Chris. Through to the Chris Moyle Show. Vaguely. Yeah. What was the. What was it? He was doing this competition and it was. It was titles, song titles, with golf. About golf. Like, so you go, like, drive the cars and that. And. And I was phone. I was getting so excited. I wanted to phone up and go, Duran Duran, Golfy Golfy, Golf, golf. And I just thought. And it might have. Oh, God, 30 quid just to ruin Chris Miles's competition. Yeah. That was a long time ago. Yeah. When we realized, you know, he was a great talent and one to watch. Yeah. Before we'd enjoyed his new TV show. But anyway. Yeah, that's not. No, that's cheap. It's j. Anyway, what should we talk about now, then? Because that was. That. That all went well. I mean, that's 20 minutes. That's 20 minutes done. And we've nailed. We've nailed amusing album titles. We've done that. That's fine. So we need a new gimmick now. I'll tell you what. You know, you know. You know when you go out, you take an umbrella, you leave the house and it's a really sunny day. Yeah. And then you come out and you. Go, oh, I wish I bothered with that because it's in the way. But then, right, imagine when you go out, right, Raining. It's raining. No, no, you go out without an umbrella. Okay. And then it rains. What's going on there? Oh, all been there. If you've got, like, funny, weird observations of things that happen. Like that. Yeah. Stuff like that about umbrellas or any kind of sort of accessory, this is. Going to be brilliant. 700, 800, 1234. Just comedy observations. Stuff you thought of, wacky stuff you thought of. Tell us what stuff you come up with. Get the Sony people on the phone. This is dynamic. Suede positivity. Absolutely. They could always do a good chorus, couldn't they? They could indeed. I think we could play Pink. Is it just. Is that really way out you're saying that you can't play Pink? I like that new one. Yeah. But whether or not it's in the building upset. Do you know who that's written by? Do you know who that's written by? Trying to call the nurse, but she's being a little bitch. This is a little interesting, you know. Let's get the party started. I'm coming up. Yeah. You know who that's written by? Well, the way you say it sounds a like. Is it Radiohead? Tom York? You're thinking. No, no. Let's get the party started. I'm coming. I'm coming up. Careful. I'm coming up. Let's get a party started. Another one. More guess. Is it Johnny Rotten? This is the truth. It's written by that woman with the goggles and the big hat that used to be in 4 non blondes. Is it? It's written by her. You're not looking. You're not thinking of Snork, are you? No, no, no. I often. I oft got the two confused, but no. So a goggle. A sn. Goggle. And the big hat. She had a big hat, didn't she? And a pair of goggles and kind of sort of a sort of look about her. What do you mean? Goggles? You can't say gypo. What do you mean? Goggles? Yeah, it's a terrible derogatory term. She's like. Well, she looked like some kind of stranger and she sort of had like. Matted dreadlocks and selling clothes pegs. Yeah, listen. Lucky. Lucky Heather. Lucky Heather, yeah. She had a big leather. When you got stopped with lucky Heather and you didn't buy it when you had some bad luck. I had some bad luck about 10 minutes later. Yeah. So I always stop and buy something. I've got shed loads of it at home. I don't know when you got. Throw it away. They don't tell you how long you've got to keep it for. For the good luck. 6Th of January. Yeah. Keeping it after. That's bad. Like. I'm getting confused again, aren't I? No, what it was. I don't know which myth to believe in. Right, stop it. Let's go back to. I've got a party started. Yeah. That is so Fleagle. She's. Is that her name? No, that's one of the Banana Splits. Now you confuse me. Fleagle's the one with the big teeth and the goggles, right? Snork is the one with. Basically, to be honest, I think it's an elephant. Okay? I think they've. They've pretended they've made up an animal. So many people listening who don't know who the Banana Splits are. The Banana Splits, right, listen. They know the Banana Splits are. And Even people under 20, you know, Snork Fleegle, Drooper, who was the other one? If you can remember the name of. What's the number? Because I actually want to know. This. This is what radio's for when I can't think of something, they tell me Drooper and Snork I have no idea. Fleegle Drooper and Snork droop around. Fleegle. Bingo. Nice. Well done. Don't bother calling that particular tragedy or that has been avoided. Bingo. I don't know what it looks like. Yeah, there was one anyway. There was one that's sewn up. Eyes Drooper. I think. Sorry, go on. No, anyway, my point was this. Go on. Pink. Oh, I can't be bothered. No, really. I think we can play that new one by Pink. You can sort of play Pink. Why? Because it's too poppy. They just won't allow pink on XFM. They what? They will not allow pink on XFM. They what, wait a minute. That's Red. Rag to a bull. Someone's telling you that you can't do something. That's crazy. Right, let's get the new Justin Timberlake single. Rick, you'll have to nip down and have a word with Foxy because we haven't got it up here. Really? Yeah. Can't you call someone at Capital Radio? Well, you know. What's that one by Busted? That's what I go to school for. What about ABS Dynamite? Abs? The new one from ABS Dynamite. Well, play a record and we'll discuss this Pink thing. We do a bit of Cat. Oh, cat Stevens. Yeah, Cat 4. This is Sittings. Lovely piano and everything. Is it? Oh, this was the tune we were originally going to use as the theme music for TVs the Office. That starts again on Monday, I think, as well. Just play Cat Stevens and Sitting. I couldn't find Pink Rick, but I've got the S Club Juniors. What do you think? Pink is all right. Just because it hasn't got the credibility of, like, new punk and new metal. It's a good tune. It's all right. We've never been snobby. We've never worried about credibility, have we? Hearsay. They're all down there. I'm gonna get them. I'll tell you what, if you're gonna do that, I'm just gonna play adverts from now on. Supergrass Grace on XFM 104.9. I've been forgetting to say that. Yes, it's all gone to pot. I'm Ricky Gervais, with me, Steve Merchant. Hello there. Little Carl's not here. Claire Sturges is there. Hello. Yeah. Cracking now. I think we can play Pink, you know. Well, I don't know. I mean, I don't want to be responsible for it. No, I mean, I don't. I don't have a problem Particularly with the lady, you know, she's made a good effort with it and I think. But apparently it's. It's either number one or it's gonna. It's likely to be number one, really, this week. So it's not that rebellious. Me. It's not particularly rebellious, no. But I don't know. I mean, what worries me is whether the audience will turn against you and that you'll lose all musical credibility. Really. I had an email just now and I think maybe this answers why we didn't get very many calls about the. Give us a crazy band name or an album title. No, no, no. They think maybe they're all at the. The march, the big march, which I. Makes a lot of sense because I would. I would imagine a lot of the sort of losers that listen to our show. What's the march? Probably also agree that they should go and protest about a war. Oh, it's the anti war, Mark. It's the gates to war. Well, I don't really know the ins and outs of this. This whole thing, really. I mean, it sounds like it's a. Yeah. They were asked if they wanted a war and they said no. Is that so bad, Steve? No, I mean, good luck to him. I don't think he's gonna have much effect, to be honest. You don't think. No, I don't really believe him. I don't think he's worried in the light in the slightest. A couple of sort of dropouts and some sort of junkies are in the streets, you know. Well, you say that. You say that, but what's their names? Specials Free Nelson Mandela. Eight years later he was out. That's true enough. That's absolutely. I forgot about that. I think there are. And Live Aid sorted out world hunger. Yeah, that was so. That was. I can see the difference there. Ebony and Ivory. No more racism now. But musicians, that was done, Rick, you see, Musicians were involved there. Yeah, I don't think any musicians are involved this time, I think. Well, I think they've probably taken their. Their bongos and their digital tablets. You've got to see, they're walking down now. Loads of ponchos. Yeah. You were gonna wear a poncho once. You thought it'd make you more of a hit with the ladies. Oh, but they're so now. Ponchos. They are so now. So you'd have been ahead of your time, as ever. You see, I think if you wait a couple of years, those clogs will be in. Exactly. This is what I'm hoping This pipe. I like to think that they're gonna. The pipe. The pipe is definitely on the way back at some point. What do you think of a lady? Sorry? As a lady, what do you think of a man who smokes a pipe? I think it's lovely. Very sexy. I wouldn't want to sn. It takes your breath. What, because I've given up smoking, Steve. Yeah, it. It takes. I won't be giving you a blowback. I don't know what that phrase is, Rick. I. I gambled with that phrase. I don't know if A blowback. I think that could be obscene. I've got no idea what I'm going to. I think it is very, very sexy in a sort of a Valdunican kind of way. He never smoked a pipe. Did he not? No, he smoked a goat. All right. About smoking a goat. If you look at pictures of the great sort of thinkers of our time, and, you know, maybe they're at college or university in the sort of 1930s, you've got those great. You know, the great thing of people who became the great artists of our century, and you see pictures of them in Oxbridge when they're in 19. They're all smoking pipes in tweed suits. Yeah. No, young people now are smoking pipes. I fear that it's going to be dead in, like, 15 years. I don't think anyone's gonna be smoking pipes. But I think again, you feel like maybe it's me at a certain point. Maybe I've got to try and bring it back. Bring it back. You know, then we could be seeing kids in Top Shop on a Saturday. Let's not forget sniffing. Snuff. Some snuff. My nan used to sit there with two brown stains just dribbling through her nose. Lovely. Yeah. Snuffing some gin. Well, this is it. Because my friend always said if he won millions of pounds, he'd spend it all trying to bring back, as a fashion accessory, the cape. Because you can make such an entrance with the cape. And a cane. A cape and a cane, yeah. And a top hat. I wish people had to wear hats. Now. I see. I can see my shape and size. I look like Bertie Bassett. You like Basil Rap? Well, I'd look pretty good. Wow. Can I sweep into a room? See, I think you look like. Don't get this wrong. Don't take this wrong. We're mates. I think you look like a freak with a cape on. Okay, so. All right, well. And at which point would you take it one step further and add the Deer stalker, you know, and go the whole Sherlock Holmes. Yeah. I'd have the cape, the pipe, the deer stalker and I'd solve crime. It was great. It looked like you could be my fat companion. I could be what? I sort of like get padding and stuff. Yeah, no, I like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like to solve. I'd like to solve more crimes, if I'm being truthful. I'd like to. I would love to solve one crime. I wouldn't mind if I solved it. If they please came to me and said. I went. I just look at the first block. Go in. Yeah, just get it off the streets, you know, I mean just like tick done that. Yeah. But I just thought there'd be something quite. I feel like maybe I. Because, you know, like in, in TV shows it always used to be, you know, they were like. They were adop actor who also solved crimes. They were a plumber. They solved crimes, Quincy. Yeah, but you know, a couple of sort of BAFTA winning writers solve crimes. That's good. What did Heart To Heart do? They just millionaires. They were just a couple. A millionaire couple who would invariably sort, you know, every week though. Every week. Cut to heart. Murder she Wrote. She wrote it and she solved it. We sold it. It's brilliant. Murder she did wouldn't have been such a good sort of thing. No, no. But this is why you don't seem to get that anymore. You know people who do one job for a living, you know DJ who also solves crimes. The DJ who solved crime. That was Shoestring. Was he a dj? Yeah, he wasn't he. He was a private on the radio. Is that what that was that the. Thing they did not Private eye, private ear. Is that what they said? Yeah. And how did he solve it? He worked out clues for callings and stuff? No, he used to leave the building. He didn't just sit there and play records and then try and guess. That's great. Give us a call on the usual number if you've got any idea who murdered. Now it's Snitch Hour. Got a letter here. I know a lot of my friends are big fans of Midnight Caller. Yeah, it was one of those late night things in America, wasn't it? But it was he a dj. He solved crimes, didn't he? I don't know if he'd solve crimes or just solved. If you've ever solved a crime. Email puzzles. He had one of those Puzzler books. Weren't you on the front cover of Puzzler once? One of those things you Get. Weren't it Puzzler? Were you? Was I? No, I don't think so. Oh, it was your other friend. So was Puzzler a rude thing? No, no, it's one of those things. That those puzzle books you can buy. You do for coach journeys. And they just put. They just put people's picture on without permission. Yeah, I know. People are just like, well, I didn't give permission. They just find like. Like celebrities and they just get their picture and they stick them on the floor. They would have used me then. Would they? Well, I forgot. I didn't. I didn't. Hey, Pink. Should we play Pink? Yeah. Oh, man. I don't live by the rules. Be on your head. Here we go. That was the Strokes and kids of. Kids are mental. Yeah. No, you're all right. No, shut up. No, the thing is, I think if we'd introduced that as just. And we didn't mention who it was, and we just said, this is the new one from one of those trendy new bands, you know, the Boomtown Rats, these listeners would have happily accepted it. Yes, it was. They knew it was pink. And the phone lines have gone crazy. We had upwards of two calls. I'll tell you this. We have between two and four calls and. And they've not enjoyed it. Why do we do this show? We don't need to do this show. Because you love us. We could be on Radio one. Oh, man. We could be on Radio two. Probably. I don't know. Virgin, I think, called once. Someone's just email. They just said Pink. Sounds like Run for the sun by Bucks Fizz. I can see what we're thinking. I can see what they're thinking. What do they want then? Well, yes. Okay. What's the phone number again? You know what people like. I know. Do you? I never understand who. Phones are ready. Who tries. It took us like two hours to fail to get through to Chris Moyles phone radio stations. Can you please play the new one by the Strokes? You just buy it or you'll have the album. Why have you got to hear it on the radio? What difference does that make? Some guy talks at the end and the beginning of it partially ruins the song. I can't understand who phones up for request. We're really alienating our listeners now, aren't we? We're going. We don't care what you think. Go and buy it. We're gonna play what we want and we don't care. Yeah, I mean, we're not being particularly funny or interesting. We haven't even got that to fall back on. I'll tell you what it is, Rick. Arrogance, Laziness. When you've got a hit TV show on your hand and you've won the awards and you're doing and you're making the kind of money that you are at those massive corporate gigs, yeah, where they're paying you thousands of pounds to turn up for 10 minutes, you don't need this rug. I mean, Steve, don't you get that then? I'm afraid I don't, Claire. No. No. We carved it up early on that Steve would not be making the so of money that I would. Yes, and he shook on that. That was written contractually. Yeah. So I think you did shake on that. Oh, yeah, it would. And it would be horrible to go back. I don't think he realized quite the difference. Yeah, but success. I don't think he'd want me to welsh on it. I don't think he'd be happy with himself if I gave him any money. I couldn't live with myself if you gave me some of that care. Well, what should we play then? What should we play? Some states. Thank God for that. Electric soft braid. Same way every day. Is that what you want? Is that what you want? Do you mean me or the listener? The listener, sure. Is it? What? So they didn't like so they want good music? They see, apparently, Rick, they would prefer good music to. They want good music, do they? Are you sure they want good music? They appear to want good music, Rick. Why? Wait a minute. What you thinking? I was thinking of playing a really good record next. Oh, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no. They. They've w me up now music. They don't. Right. So I will do a little deal with them, okay? I will play them a fantastic piece of music as long as they promise to turn the stereo up to number 10. What about the neighbors, Rick? Think about the neighbors. What, you think they'll annoy the neighbors? They. Maybe I want them to annoy the neighbors. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Rick. You know what that was? What? It's the sound of the rule book being torn up. Yes. Yeah, Rick. Yeah, yeah. You think I'm playing with fire? It sounds like it. Maybe I like getting burned. Oh, careful, Rick, careful. Because you could scold your hands, but what about your elbows, right? This is a great piece of music by one of the greatest bands ever, okay? It's one of their best songs. Yeah, that's okay. It is long. It's a long tune. Well, you know, What? What? What? You can't handle it? You can't. You don't want eight minutes. Eight minutes of cracking music. Yeah. Listen to this. Switch off your radio. No, seriously, turn the radio up. Turn it. Crank it up. Crank it up. Go rock it up. That makes up for Pink. Oh, man alive. Oh, it's amazing track. It's incredible. It is. I mean, incredible. It's textbook rock and roll. But that. When I was growing up, I had two favorite lyrics all time, and one of them's in there. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Yeah. It sends a shivering spot. It's fantastic. And the other one was, it's on America's tortured brow that Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow. Nice. Yeah, that is nice. Got a phone in? This would be a competition. What should we give away? Office. We haven't got any, have we? Just. Why don't you just sign your signature on a piece of paper or something? That's got to be worth something in a couple of years. Four quid. Yeah, £4 you get on ebay. Cheapen the piece of paper. Yeah, it's not. If it's a rubbish bit of paper, which I probably would sign. There's an email here from Davey. No, wait a minute. Look at that. Oh, my God, they've gone mad. They answer it, put them live, they might know the answer. Hang on. We'll give them some. We'll give them some cd. How do you. How do you. Why do you figure that out? Let me just read this email. Go on. If you're having to play. It says here, if you're having to play extra ad breaks and eight minute long songs, it just goes to show who provides all the material for that radio show of yours. Did Carl secretly write the office as well? And I think to myself, it's like, what? What do you want from us? The most incredible rock and roll tunes ever laid down on vinyl. And you're whinging. I know. Because you'd rather have our inane banter. What kind of a person are you? No, they'd rather have Carl's name. Don't big your roll up. Leave. I've just had a phone call from a very nice girl saying, where's Carl? I said, well, you know, he's back next week. What's wrong with me? She went, no, you're lovely, Claire, but Carl comes the other two down. Sure. Really? Can we just see if someone's on the phone? All right, what are we gonna give him? We're gonna give him some CDs. Anyone there? Hello? Hello? Oh, there's someone there. Oh, I've got a bit of headphones on. Oh, hang on. What was the. What was the lyric? Stay there, please. All right. It's on America's tortured brow that Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow. Life on Mars, David, it's easy as that. What's your name? Name? It's John Ball. John Ball. John, I'll be honest with you. We got nothing. We got nothing to give you. That's not good enough. No, we'll get him some. We're giving it. Yeah. We're giving an office. We can't keep doing that, Rick. We've got nothing else. They don't give. They don't give us anything, do they? They don't they? It's the wonder we get into the building. No one's around on Saturdays. No one cares. Office dvd. Yeah. What would you really like, though, if you could have anything? Yeah, Office dvd. See, there you go. Brilliant. Stay on the line, mate, and I'll get your details. Excellent. That was a competition we did. That was like real radio. Well done. It was like real radio. Now we've got to play David Bowie, haven't we? That's what they do. No, but Foxy would have it lined up. You'll have a heart attack. Am I live on air dramatic radio and that's Sony Award winning. I know that. As you remember, when Tony Blackburn had his breakdown on there, I think. Did he win awards for that? I mean, it was pretty impressive. It was pretty tense. Yeah, but Breakdown award. Have a breakdown. Excellent. This year's best breakdown on the Tony Blackburn. Yeah, but for Tessa. Tessa, marry me. Yeah, it was something like that, wasn't it? Can you play the same song again and again and again? Must be fascinating radio. That sounds like capital now. High five. We've done there. Oh, well done. Well done. Are we owned by Capital? What happened last time? Sure. And now Richard park, who owned Capital, he's is the grand master. What, his grandfather? No, he's a headmaster of Fame Academy. Oh, is he? Yeah. Okay, let's play record now because you. You have to lie down because you're just getting so worked up. And now I can tell when there's an excitement and enthusiasm and sweat. Beads of sweat run down. It started off so badly, we had nothing. Then I did a competition, gave away some things. You've got an email that really annoyed you, haven't you? Well, we can talk about that later. Yeah, but yeah, whenever I see beads of sweat, I know, because that's not the Ricky Gervais. I know. Okay. It worries me. You never work yourself up into any kind of sweat. Okay, let's just play out. We're going so well now, aren't we? What about a bit of Beck? A lovely bit of beck. Just to chill everything out. Just calm everything down. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah. All right. Relax. Okay. There you are. You said he's gone. Yeah, yeah. Beck. Beautiful, that. Good shot. Brilliant. Yeah, I enjoyed it. Lost cause xfm 104.9. It's going well in it. Oh, I'm loving it. All right, let's do something else then. I'd love to reach some average. Oh, please. There it is. Life on Mars with that great lyric by David Bowie. Indeed. Although it's not quite as good as what was the one? Was it Jeff? Lynn. The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one. And yet they come. Yeah. And still they come. Get. Where'd you get that? A lab. I'd like to. A million to one. But it's. It's a million to one. And still they come. They didn't know the odds. I go, what are you doing? It's a million to one. It's a million to one on you. We should have put that on. You didn't tell me you and notified us. We could have split it 50. 50. I could have moved it a little bit. I could have gone, wow. I could have probably got them up to a million and a half. Gorg. What? Now you're here, we're never going to get good dogs. Gorg. The chances of that. The chances of that happening were mini. What have you come for? They probably come for that. Well, why didn't you sneak it? They come for that quash drink, haven't they? Again? You could have snuck. What are you doing? No. And flown back and then made another. You know that fella we come for that drink you call Quash? I bet he'd get off with Snork. Are you thinking of weird stuff again? You're thinking of crazy ideas again. What about those. Those smash aliens? You got something on them, have you? Yeah. You know they went out, right, without an umbrella. Poured down. I knew it would anyway. David. Barry, this is spiraling. Can I just mention Lynn? Lynn, who's just phone. Because she was queuing up all night outside the Apollo for Bowie tickets and she got a pair, so she's dead. Can you dedicate that to everyone who's queuing up? So, yeah, yeah. And I wanted to tell you about the time Bowie came into xfm. To talk to Zoe Ball. David came in. Did. He was just recently. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not going to mention her name. She works in the office. Charlotte. When he walked by her desk, which you have to do when you come to the studio, she didn't actually meet him, shake his hands or make eye contact, but she actually cried because he was in her vicinity. Really? She looked. She actually burst into tears when he walked by. Do that. So, you know, you've got something in common. A little something in common with. Yeah, but they whimper and weep when you're. I mean, it's sort of like. There's a lot more screeching. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A lot of screaming. Tell them about that email you just got. Right. I got told of the. I nearly said the fans. People who happen to be listening to xfm waiting for the person after us who's on next. Natasha. Football show. Right. Steve was genuinely annoyed. I laughed. Right. Steve was genuinely annoyed. He doesn't like. He doesn't like rudeness or people insulting him from a distance. I'm not sure I can find it. Oh, what was it? Oh, you got to find it. Well, hang on, let me. Oh, hang on. This is good radio as well. The sound of. Was a mouse clicking in the distance. I just keep talking. What? Come up with some magic. What was Scooby Doo all on about? Talking dog is a bit weird. Is it? And then. Right. What was that? Wacky mouses. I don't know what it. So why did they run the cavemen if they can't. I've got it. I've got it. Right, okay. This is an email. This is an email that was sent through. True. Right. This is my feeling. I think if you're going to email an insult, you've got at least be clear what the insult is. You can't. You can't make me do the work. You can't make me try and guess or figure out. No, it's like sending someone hate mail and they have to pay postage. Yeah, exactly. If you're gonna. Exactly. Or making. Yeah. An obscene phone call. But yeah. Yeah. The Postman Just you 25ft before he. Had you let them. Yeah, go on. It says Merchant. It opens with Merchant. Who are you call sad, exclamation mark. At least my mother still don't cut my hair. Merchant, who you call sad. At least my mother still don't cut my hair. Is it an anagram? I don't know. I feel like it's been translated from the French. Yeah, it's a Japanese fellow. Exactly. And he's got a Japanese English dictionary. It's just literal. So how do you know your mum cuts your hair then? Have you said. You've never said that on there, have you? It's not true. Can I just say, I think your hair looks really nice. I've known you for about five years now. It's lovely. I love. I laughed at you needing someone to say it. It looks fine. Yeah, it looks good. It looks fine. It does look good. It looks good. He's got a little bit of product on it. Maybe. Maybe Gavin had his fingers all over it yesterday. Yeah, I have my hair cut by Gavin of West Hamster. Is that is what it's called? Gavin, Obviously a bloke who works in. Is a Gavin who works in. He. That fudge stuff. Sorry, no, no, I use a form. Of clay, a molding clay. Yeah, that's. Yeah, Gavin recommended it. Gavin recommended it and I've been very happy so far. Oh, not though, Rick. What do you use? I don't. Yeah, don't. I just thought, well, that's obvious. No, I just sort of like comb it back and whatever away it falls, really. Yeah. But you had more questions about Gavin. Yeah, no, I was up seeing Gavin yesterday, just having a haircut. There's no. Nothing untoward. And. And I was. And I went, I popped past Habitat, there's a Habitat and it's quite a trendy kind of designer furniture shop or whatever. And I popped in there, I thought, I'll pick up the. The sort of brochure, the, the catalogue that there was a big stack of the new catalog. You were stunned by the prices. You're going to tell me, aren't you? No, I'll tell you what. I was about walking out with the guy went, hey, where you. Hey, where you going with the hair? It's a great looking haircut, but where are you going with that catalog? I went, what do you mean? He went, it's two quid. You've got to pay £2 for a catalogue from Habitat. And I was. And I said, well, I could go down to Argos, I can get as many as I want for free. I go crazy in Argos. I can get them little woods to the mail order people. They'll send it to my home. Yeah, I gotta pay 2. There's lingerie in that one, you know, you've just got like some furniture and stuff and I'm paying two quid from. If there were some ladies draped over the kind of fighting cabinets, I'd be interested. What did you say that? You didn't say, I can go down to Argus and get as many as I like. What did you say? Yeah, I did. I did. I said. I said. Well, what are you talking about? This is. I. What am I paying for? Is it weird charging for a catalog. Just to tell me what I might want to buy? It's sort of their calling card. It's like paying for a poster or a sticker. Exactly. This is what it's like. It's almost like paying an entrance fee to go into the shop. Yeah, that's a good idea. It's a good idea. It's a good. I mean, because it's good to just walk around and browse. So. I mean, I'd buy a quid to walk around a really good shop. Yeah. But I'll tell you this, the. Yeah. If Habitat maybe had some kind of like sort of center fold. Why don't you do this? I'll tell you what, A great shop like Habitat, you pay a pound, right. If you buy anything that comes off the thing. If you don't buy anything thing you've. You've paid them to stop wasting their time. It's an incentive to buy. I wouldn't like it. Sure. I wouldn't go in there. I think it's a terrible idea. Well, anyway, that's, that's, that's. What should we play? That was a sideways look at the. The world of high street shops. I think you should play the award winning Miss Dynamite. Yeah, Miss Dynamite. Good that in it. It's cracking. Yeah, it's very good. Yeah. Mercury Award winning. Absolutely. Well done. Yeah. Good luck to her. Good luck to her. I must have it. I wanted the streets, but she's a very good second choice and, you know, wish you all the luck in the world. All the luck in the world. I'm looking at your hair. It's not bad, is it? And you've. You have bigged it up. So you're quite So I assume you didn't go to a barber. You've got this. This is a hairdresser. This is Gavin of West. Okay. I'm gonna ask you now, right. And I'm not gonna take the mickey, even if it's a hundred pounds. I think you're a fool and I know you wouldn't pay that much. Much. But it's obviously more than the fiver then, isn't it? How much do you pay Ricky Gervais for this haircut? I paid the princely sum and I was proud of it. 22 notes. But that's right. But I went up to 24 because I was pleased with what I asked. A little tip for him. Two quid tip. Two quid tip. I could have just given you one of those habitat catalogs. He'd have been pleased with that. Slap that on the desk. Yeah. And he'd have gone, thanks very much. You'd like to go. I'm gonna be honest, Gavin, that is not free. Exactly. If that'd have been Argus catalog, then throw me out of it. Insult. Look at the price. Price good. Two quid. Yeah, that two quid is yours. Yours. You're taking that? Would you prefer the money? What should we do? Oh, we're usually play a new one around this time. What new adverts have we got? Plenty here. Come on. Come on. Are you in? No. Badly Drawn Boy. I imagine that start in a British film. Film? They're jumping on a London bus and they're going around London. Well, of course, the film about a boy he did the soundtrack for. So if you were a little bit more up on films and stuff, you'd have already known that that idea has been done and you would have embarrassed yourself and there wouldn't be egg on all our faces. Oh, thanks very much. Sorry about that. I'm eating. I'm very messy, aren't I? What have you got, Steve? What you got for me? I'm glad you've asked. Thanks for asking. This is a Stevie Wonder track. Now, I hope people aren't as offended by Stevie as they were by Pink. I'm sure they won't be. I mean, for goodness sake, he's one of 20th century's greatest artists. Yeah. This is from an album not one of his more famous fulfilling. This is first finale. This is a track called you'd haven't done Nothing But. Rick, here's a little quiz for you. A little pop quiz for you. There is a very famous backing vocal group here. I mean, they were famous in their own right, but here they're doing backing vocals. I'd like you to identify them. And there's a. There's an office DVD wigging its way to you, Ricky, if you can spot who it is. Okay. The pressure's on. Oh, magnificent. Do you not enjoy that? Excellent. Fantastic. Stevie Wonder. You haven't done nothing from fulfilling this first finale. It's quite tricky that the backing vocals. They'Re not particularly prominent and it could be. Anyway, that's why I just go for someone that's a vocal group with it. I don't know, is it obvious or is it very obvious what it would be that they would back him. It's not obvious that they would back him, but it's obvious that. I mean, they are huge stars or they were huge stars. And what is. Was it my. So what, mid-70s, early-70s? Mid-70s? 1974 is the album. There's an office DVD wing. It's not the Jackson 5, it's the Jackson 5. Is it really? There they are. Well done. Well, there you go. Yeah, I mean, that's how big Stevie was that you could ask the Jackson 5 just to stroll in. There you go. Some fairly non descript backing vocals. First. First album I ever got. Jackson 5, was it. Which one? It was the one with Rocking Robin on it. Nice. Did you rock to that? I imagine you did. I walked around to that. How old were you? Eighteen? I was about, I suppose, I don't know, 11 or 12. And I. One of those little cassette players when you had to press down play and watch it and a little handle that came out. They're brilliant. Yeah. And I had one CD with it. Well, one tape. One tape, yeah, sure. And. And you bought it yourself, did you? No, no, that was Christmas present. Lovely. And that was the only one you had for like, imagine like a year or something. Just one tape? Yeah. What was your first record purchase? It was a Disco Fever compilation. Well, actually called Disco Fever and I got it because I. I loved. Yes, sir. Were you embarrassed about having your mobile on or what? Something's vibrating and I'm assuming it's a. Mobile, so it's my boyfriend. I did turn the ringer on. Off. Sorry. So what, it's a Disco Fever compilation. Yeah, yeah. Featuring Bakara. Yes, sir. I can boogie. Cracking. Yeah. And space Float on, I think. Which is what I want. What I want. Yeah, that's one. Yeah. The floaters. Yeah, yeah. Always made me laugh. Larry. Yeah, My name's. I don't know. Magic Fly by space. All right. Do you remember that? No, no, no. I don't know if my first purchase is cool or not really, because I suppose it seems like it was. It was the Greatest Hits of the Strangling Is that is always Strangers. Quite cool. That's scary because I. Yeah, I finished school by the time that that came out. I think that's scary. The greatest strangers that. My parents didn't have any records in the house. They had. I think they had the Jeff Love Orchestra. Plays big war theme tunes. They had one of those Top of the Pops albums with a woman wearing a neckerchief on the COVID Yeah. And. And that was pretty much it. And the 1812 Overture, you know, played. I had one of those with Mozart, Mozart's 40th on it because that was. That was released at the time. Oh, that wasn't obviously Mozart's 40th birthday. That been a wild swing. If he made it that far, that would have been great. I'd love to hear that on. On record. How old was he when he died? He was quite young, wasn't he? Didn't live long. He was a boy wonder. Yeah, he's one wonder. It was like Ali Jones. It was all over by the time he was 11. What a lot of people don't realize about Mozart was that he also, in his spare time, used to solve crimes. Yeah, that was why he was so. That's musical crimes, plagiarism issues, things like that. We have indeed. We brought that right back. I hate to interrupt you boys. We have got to squeeze one more song. What should we do? What should we have? What have we got there, Claire? Well, I've got this. This one I want to play you. What is that? You want to play the electric 6? It better be good because if you end a show with it, I mean, we've had lots of faux pas. Really bad. It's going to be possibly the biggest song of 2003. Then life. This is it. Thanks very much indeed, Claire, for Carl back next week. Yeah, but. Yeah, yeah, yeah, just. He doesn't care, does he? Can we could just quickly say. So you're on Parkinson tonight then, Ricky? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay. And the office starts. What is it, Monday? This is easier, this, isn't it? And there's a DVD winging this way. I guess I do want one. See you next week.",
