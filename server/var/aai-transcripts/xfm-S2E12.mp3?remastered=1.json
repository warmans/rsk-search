I'm Ricky Gervais, with me, Stephen Merchant and also over there, little Carl Pilkington. Indeed. See the right up in Heat this week? No. Is it good stuff? Basically, Carl's show? Yes. Which. Which is fair enough. No, I mean, he's the only one doing any work. We thought no one had noticed, but Heat were on it straight away. Yeah, they. They picked out. I read it to him over the phone. It said two hours of music and everything. Like Carl Pilkington, he does Educating Ricky. Where a strand where he educates Ricky and Rockbusters, which is loosely based on Blockbusters. Says you. You know, basically you'll be tuning in for that. And I read that to car and he went, oh. And I was gonna drop it. So he believed the hype? He believed the hype, Yeah. I think you've got to. I mean, it's like you've got to. Mix it up is what you're saying. People are saying to you at the moment, are you going to do another series of the Office? It's kind of like that. I've got to decide whether it's to move on with it or do something dead. Is it dead in the water? Yeah. Yeah. So what's your decision? I mean, maybe. Are you. We'll probably keep it for this week. Sure. And see how it goes. Okay. You've got anything else on the back burner. Any other ideas? Nothing. I'm still sort of. Do you know, I came up with a load of game ideas. Well, I remember there was one that was based on fast food. Yeah. The rice is right. The rice is right. Now, just when the rules pass me again, we had to identify whether it. Was a Chinese rice or steamed rice. It was a Chinese restaurant or an Indian restaurant. But is it true that you played this at home with your girlfriend and it was clear you could always tell which was which because one had an Indian sounding name and the other was Chinese sounding. No, I managed. It did work once. I managed to pick some sort of duck dish. Sounded a bit Indian. Right. But then it wasn't for the Bombay duck, was it? Which is actually a piece of fish. You don't know. You don't know. He wouldn't let me put, you know, that whipped cream in the fridge. I saw that. I thought, that's fun. Yeah. He wouldn't let me put it on him as shaving phone. But every week we have this do you know, the other week, Steve, I didn't tell you this, right? He comes in straight away, you know, I'm trying to talk about sorting the show out. What. What we're going to do. Are we going to keep it good for two hours and that grabs a pen, he says, let me draw 666. On your head because you can see the scow. Seriously. No, I said. I said, don't do that. He goes, all right, then. How about we meet halfway? Put 3, 3, 3. Every week it's the same thing, but. I quite like the cream. Did you get any cream on him at all? No. Is it the spray cream in a cheek? Yeah. He said, no. Can I just make some, like. Just spray some glasses just on your face. Father Christmas. It's nearly Christmas. Hello. Come on, It's Ricky Gervais's show. Yeah. Should we play a record and then come back to this mayhem? This crazy mayhem? Yee. Coldplay, the Scientist. Have you seen the video that? Great. It's just brilliant. I. I think I might have worked out what. What is. He's. He's walking backwards. It's all filmed backwards, but he's singing forward now. The only way I can work out they've done it without CGI in it and cheating with the lips is that he had to learn it backwards and did it sort of like bit by bit, do that. He was on Zoe's show, like, about a week ago. Oh. He sang it backwards. So he learned phrases and they filmed that. But he didn't know the whole song, did he? They must have. He couldn't possibly have learned the whole song. He must have, like, stopped it and. Dunno. It's a great video, though. They always do a good video. No, it's very good. Very good indeed. So it was. Yeah. The Scientist on Xfm141 I'm rich man is with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkerton. I had a bit of good news this morning. Go on. I was on the Tube coming down and I don't. I don't want to sound arrogant, I don't want to sound pushy, but I was at Green park and I'm fairly certain, rick, it's not 100% corporated. I'm fairly certain that a woman pinched my arse. So what do you think of that? Yes, There's a lot of pickpockets around. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. My wallet was still there, really? But even if it wasn't, you know, that would have been money well spent. But the wallet was still there. So how. What do you think of them apples, eh? So what, does he just pinch? I don't. I can't confirm it at this stage exactly what happened, but it certainly felt like a pinch. I looked around, there was a woman behind me. Right. She was fairly old. She was. I think she's probably in her mid-30s. Right. Kind of reddish hair. Right. I don't know if she's listening. Right. But she knows where I am and so I don't know how to proceed, really. Rick. I don't know if it's worth putting up some posters around the Green park area just to try and corroborate. If you saw a woman pinch the lanky guy's eyes, you could probably get. In contact with British Round and look, go back over their cc. Exactly. CCTV cameras. Yeah. And then they could probably zoom in and, you know, so identifying sort of birthmarks or she might have been holding somewhere that I could hire a private eye. Yeah. Again, money well spent. Well, so there you go. You know, I'm just saying. I'm just saying maybe that, you know, maybe things are looking up. Things getting towards Christmas. The worm has turned. Hey, I don't. I. I mean, you know, it's a little sexy story to get the show going. What do you make of that then? You're quite damning. What's your answer? Well, I mean, you're quite. Quite a tall fella. Sure. So she must have really wanted to sort of reach up and. And have a pinch. She did it with her teeth. He didn't say she was a dwarf. No, no, but Steve's taller than, you know, his ass. Yeah, but his ass isn't 6 foot 9, is it? His ass is about 3 foot off the floor. 4 foot what? 4 foot off the floor? No, I don't think so. About three. She'd have to be a. To have to reach up to pinch Steve's ass. He is very tall. But I don't know what your point is there, Carl. You just. See, you're just trying to, you know, you're just, I think maybe just a little bit jealous. Just a little bit of jealousy. Well, do you know what happened to me on the way in? Go on, homeless person. Call me a. How did he know? Do you know him? Is that why he's a local? He's like the local Big Issue fella. Oh, yeah, yeah. And you know, he knows me. He sees me walking up and down. Oh, that's how he knew. Yeah. Right. So. So normally I have a bit of A chat with him in that. And I walk past him and, you know, I can be a little bit cheeky with him because I've been cheeky with him in the past with stuff. You pinched his eyes, you know, saying stuff like, God, you're always there. I mean, you got home to go to and stuff like that. Yeah, just breaking the ice. Just breaking the ice. And he laughed at that. Right. Last time. So I thought, I can be a bit cheeky, right? So he goes, do you want a Big Issue? I said, nah. He said, come on, I've got loads of them. Right? So I. I sort of said, oh, when I was a kid and I used to do a free paper around the free papers one, I said, just put them in the bin and go home. And he went, yeah, but how am I going to get any money doing that? You. See, I can see his point. He is homeless and having to sell newspapers to get 50 PO quid or whatever. Yeah. And sometimes I treat him. Right. And today I didn't have any money. I had a takeaway last night and I normally give them a quid and I felt bad not being able to do that because I didn't have any money on me last night. Right. I couldn't look him in the eye. Did you explain this to the homeless person? The traumas of the takeaway without the tip? Did you explain that? You know, you've had it hard as well. Look, you don't have food delivered to my warm flat. Yeah, it was. Yeah. You don't know what that's like. You don't know what the trouble is because you can't have food delivered to your flat because you haven't got one. So please don't look at me like that. You should have said. But most people ignore him. At least I gave him a bit of acknowledgment. And so, yeah, took the mick. Yeah. I didn't think I was. I just was being friendly. No, I know you've got to be. Careful with the homeless because I. This is. This is true. And this is. I, you know, when the clocks went. Was it. The clocks went back recently, so you got an extra hour in bed. Yeah, And I was at Cash Point with a friend of mine and there was a homeless person sat by the Cash Point and, you know, we would get some money out. She said, spare some change. And my friends were, he's a bit awkward. He's just trying to make conversation with her. He went, oh, clocks go back. Extra hour in bed. Oh, no. I gave her two quid I felt so bad. He didn't do it intentionally. He didn't realize what he said. Just making conversation. It's tricky making conversation with the homies because there's so many areas you've got to avoid. You know what was on the telly? Yeah. You know, although I get recognized by a homeless people and they are. They. I don't know where. Well, you gotta remember that's very much your demographic. Yeah. You know people who watch tv. Yeah. In Dixon's. Yeah. There was a. Well, they can smell the alcohol on you. They think you're one of them. Oh, I've had to cut down on that. I'm. Oh, I've been really good with this training thing, the box. Oh, oh. Play a record and I'll tell you about that. I had my first week of training. I'm, I'm in trouble. I'm struggling. What do you want to play? What? We've got a bit of, have we? Stone Roses Classic. Feeder. Come back around. Xfm 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. All right. Yeah. So I started my first week of training for this charity, boxing. For those who don't know, I'm fighting Grant Bovey, Anthony Turner's husband. It sounds arbitrary, but it's actually because he's at 41 and about my weight, a bit taller, I think, but. And we've never done it before, but. No, it'd be fun battling someone for charity. No, but it's. And I can't believe my luck because I've been a fight fan for, like, 30 years and, and they took me shopping, they bought me all the gear, and the training's great. It's really hard. I mean, it's. I imagine it'd be really hard and it's probably slightly harder than I imagined. And the only bit I like. So the, the I, I, I don't like all the exercise and all the stuff you've got to do. I like the bits that look a bit like something I've seen in a Rocky film. Right, sure. You know, we did that thing with the, the string along the ring and I have to pop up and punch and that was great. Right. Skipping's not bad. I'm trying to get good at that. I like that ball that you open. Are you any good at that? Getting good at it? What's that teaching you, that particular thing? It's just the rhythm, is it? It's rhythm. And of course, your arms are up for that long, so it, you've got to keep Your guard up all the time. Yeah. So that teach you to keep your. Up. At 6 this morning, you broke some raw eggs into a cup and then you ran up the steps of the town hall, didn't you? I know. With loads of people following me. And I shouted bo at the top. No, I'm not going mad. I'm not going mad. Just, just, just, just, you know, once every, you know, every other day. But I'm struggling now. I've, I've, I. I woke up saying, it's like I've been hit by a car. Yeah. Just everything aches. The message I haven't used. But anyway, I had a meeting the first time with the people, the program makers, because they're following me for a month and everything, and Grant as well. And they said, oh, you need a sort of nickname, just for a laugh. And I went, oh, what's Grant is. And he said, oh, I think he's gonna use Gorgeous Grant Bovill. I went, oh, I don't know. Oh, gosh, I've got to go against that about Ricky Gippo Gervais. Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, I had a freaking Frank Maloney meeting the next day and it's sort of, you know, you gotta do this nickname. And the bloke said, oh, I checked out that name. You can't call yourself Jip. I went, well, of course I can't. I was joking. I said, what is racist? I was joking. I was making a joke about me bit. And then we went, oh, I don't know. And then I went down to get the. Buy all the gear from this shop. They'd have a dressing game made. Yeah, yeah. And I was picking all the stuff. I was going, oh, look, that's like Nazwar. Oh, look, that's like Ali War in there. And I'm gonna have that. I'll have that. Picking all the gear and everything. And there was a couple of boxes down there, sort of like looking at me thinking, who's that fat bloke taking that boxing at 40? And I said, I wasn't it and look good. Oh, yeah. How you doing? I went, oh, yes. How long you've been in the game? So I've been boxing 20 years. So how many fights you had? He said, about 40. And I said, oh, yeah, help me, I gotta think of a nickname. And I thought, I said, I thought Ricky Balboa Gervais. He went, right. I went, or Ricky Marciano Gervais. He looked at me and went, what about Ricky Martin? Oh, dear, absolutely. Just. I'm not respected yet in the boxing world. No, sure. But I mean, only a matter of time. Well, I think they're gonna go see you fight, Rick. Everything's gonna change. So have you actually, have you actually punched anyone yet? Have you actually. Not any, no, no, I punched pads and I punched a. The bag and I've sort of sparred in that. I know you get a chance to win. Well, as I suspected, my, my punching powers are right, but my fitness is, I mean, I felt like I was smoking. Yeah. You know, but there's, you know, bits of lung that haven't been had oxygen in them for 20 years. Yeah. And it's ridiculous. And also because it's not only it's being filmed, but there's other fighters there that are ridiculous. They're like machines. Right. And it's that thing, I go, I can go, right, I can, I can come out on top, but dying now of a heart attack, but never give up. Or I can sit down and go, I'm sorry, I'm, I feel ill. And I chose that one. And of course they took them in. Well, of course. But I mean, you know, soon, you know, as I said, I haven't got the respect yet of the boxing fraternity. But how long have you got then before. Four weeks. Okay. So, and, and do they think that they can turn you around health wise in that time? No, they're gonna, they're gonna, you know, they're gonna teach me the basics and see how it goes, you know, But I mean. And each round is four seconds, is that right? Yeah, yeah. Two, four second round with a two. Hour break in between each one. Sit down meal. So give the number. I want, I want serious suggestions of my fighting name. Nothing insulting. So we can actually use. Well, let's give out the email that's always the easiestfm.co.uk what's the number, Carl? Oh, 8 700, 812 34. It doesn't have to be in the middle, it could be at the beginning, like the rage. Okay, yeah. Ricky the rage. Sure. Ricky the man. Play a record. Talks to me about my life. Yeah, yeah. A couple of emails are already coming in Russia. They're flooding in, Rick, inevitably as boxing name suggestions for you. This is one from Matt, I think he's given a couple actually. Ricky the pudding. Gervais. Ricky Big Mac Gervais. There's a theme here, Ricky. Pasty J the pasty. I quite like the pasty. As Carl said. He said, the thing is, if you have a really good nickname, it's embarrassing when you lose. Whereas if you just call yourself yourself, it's not so embarrassing when you lose. Carl. This is doing so good for my ego. Do you know what I mean? If you have, like, killage of ace. Yeah. And then you end up, like, vomiting, choking on your own vomit, upside down, hanging out the ring, what happens if you win? Do you have to do something? Whereas there goes the pasty being stretchered off in the first two minutes. Yeah, not such a problem. There he is being lightly basted. Chuck down in mind. What do you mean? What do I have to do? Say if you say if you beat Grant. Yeah. Say if that. If that happened. Yeah, yeah. What. What happens next? What do you mean? What happens is. What do you think? Oh, this is a. A contention fight for the big one. Then we make Ricky, too. No, but, you know, do you know if they're planning on making more money? Because it's for Comic Relief, isn't it? So what happens on the next. No, it's. No, it's for charity. Comic Relief would make sense. Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Right? Yeah. It was last time. I think that was last time. Sport Relief. He's not sport. It was last time. Yeah, but this is. I think this is a program where. And how do we. Sorry, how does this. How do you make money for charity from this? Do we. Do we pay to. To sort of. For how many punches to the head you're going to take? No, no, I just. How are you going to last? I assume the BBC donate money or someone or a sponsor or whatever. So. I don't know, just. Right. Donate. Because it's actually a program. This is more about a program with a. I see. A charity angle. So. Yeah. So as if. If you get, like, killed, there's more money and food to go around. Maybe. But no, I mean, the thing is, what's the next step? Because if they go, like, right. Yeah. Well done, You've won. Thank you very much. What do you expect? That its winner stays on. Yeah. In a fair where I go there, I'd let people punch me on brunette manning. Yeah. Yeah. And then my twin gets up. Yeah. What? What? Do. What? It's just a. It's a program. It's not gonna turn pro. It's like faking it. Yeah, but what's the point if it's not going to go anywhere? Well, sorry, him fighting Grant Bovey in a ring, he's not entertainment enough. Yeah. What's the matter with you? I was gonna get his face pummeled in. That's gonna be hilarious. When I did Boxing at the youth. Club once when he did boxing, he fought once. He fought a little weak kid because it was his first day. Battered him. Next week it was someone else's turn and he got bad and he left. Yeah. I said, right, I've had enough. Yeah. There was a ladder there that I had to work. Right. And I decided after the sort of the first step, I thought, it's not for me this. Yeah. If you win, it's all kind of like, Right, well, yeah, the world's your oyster. But it's a program. It's just a one off program, isn't it? It's like, it is like you got to treat it like faking it. Yeah, but faking it. Right. That little gay fella who ended up being a doorman, he's actually doing that as a proper job now or something. He loved it so much. Do you seriously think I have any intentions of getting into the fight game and leaving entertainment behind? What's the point then? What, what do you mean? What's the point in. What's. What's the point in watching television? It's entertainment or educational. I, I watch it to sort of soak in. Well, this is educational. I'm learning a lot. I am actually learning a lot. And it's. I can't believe my luck. I've got professionals telling me, you know, hopefully how to lose weight and punch hard. That's just fun. It's like, like having golf lessons. But say, I mean, here's an example, it's a nice way to plug it. We've got Rockbusters coming up in about 10 minutes or something right now. Look forward to that. People email in and they don't just do it for fun, they do it because they know they've got some good prizes lined up. Right. So they're doing it because it gets them something. Yeah. My prize is that I've learned something in life, I've gone through an experience and hopefully I'll come out in some way better if I don't get mashed. That's it. That's surprise. That's why we do anything, isn't it? I think this is, this is example of you, Carlos. You give up too easily. Yeah. There's no point in anything. I did, I did Crusaders for. I think I lasted that out for about four weeks. What's Crusaders? Well, it was me mate, right. He was religious. I'm not really. But no, I mean, you believe in ghosts though, and shadows pushing people off bikes. But. Go on. But it's the same time I think I told you once before that I went to the church with this lad because I sworn he said he was going to tell me dad. Yeah. Effing and jeffing. So he said, is that how they. Get people to church nowadays? I love that. What kid? That. Yeah. He hasn't got. Got the idea of the protection game. There's nothing in it for him. Either you turn to religion or I tell your father. Right. So. So I went to church with him and that. And then the next week he said, I know, that was rubbish. And you didn't enjoy it. It's when I got kicked out for messing with a tennis ball in the pews. Right. I don't think we've heard that, but I don't think we could possibly go into that now. Summed it up. Yeah. So, well, no, no, come on, we'll. Come back to that. You had a tennis ball and some pubes. No, in the pews. Right. But anyway, so I went there and I said, I don't think much of this church thing. It's a bit boring. Sorry. And so you went to church and you ended up in the Crusades. Crusaders. What it is, it's meant to be the fun part of religion for kids. Right. I mean, mate said, oh, you want to come along? It's, you know, you go on a Friday night. Yeah. And do it on a Sunday as well. So I went on the Friday night. It was brilliant. He had sabotio table tennis in this dead big old house. And what do they do at the end? Say, I hope you enjoy yourself. Remember, God gave you all this. It's sort of, you know, enjoy the simple things in life. You don't need computer games. You can play table tennis and talk with your friends. Yeah. And blah, blah. So, yeah, that's all right. I think you'd be happy in a young offenders institution. You get to clean the toilets there. But don't forget, Carl, I think God invented Nintendo too. Right. Well, anyway, so that was all right. I loved it on the Friday. Yeah. I mean, mate said if you go for four weeks, four like, weeks in a row without missing a day. Yeah. You get a free badge and salvation. I don't. I don't. I don't like all this sort of being stuck in stuff. Yeah. I mean, it's like, oh, every day. Right. So anyway, so. So you've got to come again on Sunday. So I thought, well, we'll have another game of table tennis, it'll be all right. Yeah. So anyway, I go on the Sunday. Who was this who was this servant of God. Right. I go on the Sunday, it's like a totally different club. There's no table tennis. That's how they trick you. No, sabutio. Yeah. They start handing out Bibles. Oh, it's like a timeshare thing. They trick you. So. So I didn't go again on Sundays. Let's go on the Friday. Just go on the Friday. Brilliant. I've amazed no one else saw. The thing is, there used to be loads there on the Friday. They won't even notice if I'm not like. Yeah, I mean that. I'm not showing up on a Sunday. So anyway, carried on. It was just this kid in the vicar. Oh, I love that. You got one over on the church. So I was loving it, right. Playing table tennis and that. And then on a Sunday they found out where I live. And the head fella started coming around, knocking on the door. It's God. He's everywhere. Why did he knock? Politeness. The fellow who, like around the club, he started coming around, knocking on the door and I saw him coming up the path and I said to my mum, oh, it's the fella from the Crusaders. She didn't even know what I was. No, she thought you were off nicking hardcats and stealing cars. Yeah, yeah. Clue what I was talking about. We brought you up. So I said, look, just tell him I'm not in. Tell him not in. And she had to keep doing this. And they were coming round every Sunday to try and make me, like, go on a Sunday. It was really important that I went and that I was abusing the system and all this. Anyway, I didn't go. And then. Why didn't they just tell you on next time we turned up? On a Friday? Yeah. No, because there was so many people there on a Friday. You just get mixed in, in the crowd. Yeah, it was jammed. It was well popular on a Friday. Yeah, yeah, right. But anyway, on one of the Sundays it was. It was quiet for a bit and they stopped coming round. So I thought, right, I can go out again, Right. On a Sunday. Because I used to avoid hanging around the house. Reign of terror. Incredible. So I thought, great, they forgot about me. Yeah, everything. I can carry on in sort of normal life now. Yeah. And I was playing out in the avenue. Fella comes round, oh, and he goes, there you are. Oh. You know, you're always busy on a Sunday. You enjoy Fridays and that, don't you? I was like, yeah, yeah. He goes, well, come on, you've got to come with Me and I couldn't get out of it. I mean, it's like, what could I say? Charlie says, right, yeah. So anyway, nearly killed me in a car crash. So that was the excuse I used. Next time he had a Mini, right, and he was driving us there and he hit the curb, nearly sort of turned over the Mini. It was like three of us in the back. So I said, that record. So next time, next time he came round to pick us up. I said, look, really enjoyed it and that. I said, but ever since that journey, I really, you know, I don't. I don't want to get in the car with you again because it scared me a bit. And I said, all right, then I didn't have to go again. That's all right, isn't it? That's extraordinary. Yeah. He almost killed you in a car. It's a parable. Thank. Thank God no one was hurt. Yeah, I remember that. Your life moves in incredible ways. Yeah. Rather like. God. Yeah. So they're probably around there now, aren't they going, is he coming tomorrow? What we got? Well, we talk about the prizes next. Well, let's talk about the prices. We've got the. Yeah, we've got the big game rock busters coming your way soon. Rick, I know you're excited about that and I. Is there more Educating Ricky this week? Have you got that planned? There is. We are struggling on that feature a bit now cuz I feel like we. We've covered a lot of topics. Yeah, I know. Well, I know about hairy Chinese kids and deaf people that hit their head and can hear again. So I don't think there's lots more to learn in life. Hives. Hate to say I told you so. 104.9 will be Steve Merchant and the amazing Carl Pilkington. Right, prizes. Yes. Rockbusters. Yeah, it's one of the big exciting quiz shows and this may be one of your last chances to play. There's rumors that it's gonna get ditched, Rick, that Carl Pilkinson, the creator and mastermind behind it, it's already grown tired of it. It's often the way you heard them earlier on the Very Best of the Stone Roses from that we played I Want To Be Adored. That's one of the prizes. That's a nice little Christmas compilation. Second hand now then really in it. Second hand. Yeah. 50 years of the greatest hit singles. I'll tell you, there's some great stuff on here. Oakland's Rick with Bohemian Rhapsody. One of the. One of the biggest number ones of all time. If you've not heard that enough already, you're followed then by John Lennon's Imagine, Candle in the Wind, Elton John. You've got all on one cd. Stephen. Well, these are some of the greatest rock mines chosen. Some of the best songs by some of the best artists. Paul McCartney's Mull of Kintyre that's on there. We've got. Let me see. That is pretty impressive though, because they are real big classic number ones as opposed to, you know, the. The. By the artists they didn't really care about. You see those things on this is not available in the shops and it's, you know, the second best song artists have done. It seems odd that we're giving away on XFM because it includes Robbie Williams. Angels. Yeah. Atomic Kittens, Hole Again, Spice Girls, Want To Be Connie Minogue's Can't get out of the Head. And I think it closes. Well, it almost closes with steps. Tragedy. That's the penultimate track. It ends, though. Any ideas? Big, big hit single. But did they know it's Christmas? Band Aid, perfect for your Christmas party. Sure. We've also got the Groove Armada current album. Is that from there? Yeah. And signed by the man himself. The Big Beach Boutique dvd. Fat Boy Slim's concert on that. Brighton Beach. And there's all kinds of treats on there. And includes a. An audio commentary by Norman Cook. I don't know how that works. Three hours of him going. This is where the needle almost jumps. Watches. I did a little bit of scratching. I'm not very good at scratching, but just look forward to that. I'm putting a. Put in a different track. You see me there? There's the crowd. Loving it. Excuse me. I'm just waiting. But this is where I. I put. I go from. I go from Conga Squad to Basement Jacks. Yeah, look forward to that. That's one of my own pop on what you see there we. I got Praise. You ready? That's slightly dusty. I just had to wipe that down with a damp rag. Yeah, look forward to that. Plus, I suppose this is good if you're a fan. This is a box set of the first series of Linda Green. I think a new series starts this week or has already started. I'll tell you what I found while I was clearing up, Rick, because I know there's not a big movie this week. We normally give away a big movie. I was moving house this week and I found a video that you're more than welcome to if you're a fan. No, it stars Kurt Russell, executive Decision. I've got that to give away if you're interested. Executive decision. Steven Seagal in a cameo as well. So I think he's. I think it's on TV this week, Rick. So if you miss it this coming Friday, you don't tape it this Friday. Well, here it is on. Bring it in. Because I think Carl's excited about that. I think Carl would like to win that, wouldn't he? Great prizes there. How about if you come up with an extra Rockbusters today for the. For like the bonus prize? I don't think I'm the man for the job, Carl. I think it has to come from your unique take on the world, Carl, you don't. I don't think you've quite worked out why you're funny and why things you do are good. Go on then. Right, you're ready then. So just in case you haven't heard it before, I give you some initials of a band or an artist. We're not doing Rockwesters now, are we? Yeah, I thought, well, we could keep that going then. We got. I love educating Ricky. That's my favorite thing now. Well, what do you want to do, Steve? It's just that you've. It sort of bigged up the prizes. And so this is only by email. Give the email address out now for people to write it down now, Carl. Right, it's ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk ricky.gervais fm.co.uk Only entries on email. Yeah. You're gonna get three clues. You've got to get them all, right? And you win all. You win all those prizes, you said. Okay, Carl, go on then. Right, and just a quick example, one of the first ones we did, it was like AK and the clue was exploding pet. Yeah. And it was automatically. Right. So you understand how it works. Now, these are your clues. The first one, that army has got some well nice trenches. That army has got some well nice trenches. Excellent. And the initials there are DW. Do you write some of the questions for 15 to 1? Go on. So that army has got similar phrasing trenches. Okay. Okay. The second one, what were the initials there, Carl? Mattress dw. Dw, yeah. Right. The second one, the top of them curtains are all wrecked, all the materials all worn. He acts it out there. We've got to get him on telly. We have got to get him on telly because his little face and his gestures. That's the second one. The initials being H.V. okay. The top of those curtains, erect all the Material's all worn out. Right. HV and the final one. Here's the final clue. I was in Texas the other week, right. I tripped and landed on my knees in a puddle. Wh. For that one. So I was in Texas. I tripped up, landed on my knees in a puddle. So that's. Wh. Is it great? It's fantastic. Okay, time to join the record. You're playing for these compilation albums. We've got the Fat Boy Slim dvd, Linda Green on vhs, and of course, Executive Decision starring Kurt Russell as well. Oh, God. Bob Dylan. Just Like a woman on XFM 104.9. Couple more names, boxing nicknames for you, Rick. This is from Josh. Ricky Blue Eyes, I quite like. And he's also put Toad Rage, which I quite like. I'll tell you, our number one fan is emailed again. I'm pleased to announce Richard Anderson. Dickie Anderson. He was in touch. He loves this show. He's such a fan of the show. And this week he's emailed in. What actually is the point of your show? Is it to confuse, irritate, depress or what? All of those things. Dicky, thanks for noticing. Oh, he loves this show. He's such a fan. He's such a fan because last week, you remember Carl, he emailed in to say that he'd rather spend his time counting his feet than listen to this show. Presumably he's done that. How many feet? Incredible. Yeah, but he loves this. Yeah. So, thanks, R.F. thanks for listening. See you later. See Elliot, work it on XFM 104.9. Because Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Educating Ricky. Yeah, try to do a bit of that. Well, the clues are coming in furious. The answers, I should say. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So go on. And. Oh, this is what. Yeah. Rockbusters is well underway, Carl. Don't worry, you've done your work, then. Okay. Right, come on. Right. Educating Ricky. It's my favorite bit. Now, you're just gonna tease us, aren't you, with three headlines and then I'll choose one. Then we've got the other two as well. Yeah, that's how it works. And at the end of it, you learn some stuff. Like I say, I'm struggling a bit with. With knowledge. Yeah. At last he confesses. Yeah, go on. So the three headlines for you to pick from. We've got first one, we'll have a big fire tomorrow. I got a feeling there's some vegetables involved. Yeah, go on. Maybe second one. He's a bit of a nuisance. Okay, right. And the third one. I'll bake on in the morning if you're sick of having ear. Oh, that one. I'll bake on in the morning if you're sick of having me. Right, I'm having that one. That's brilliant. Right, well, it's a saying. Do you know, cold shoulder. Giving someone the cold shoulder. Yeah. All right. If you have someone around at your house and, you know, you try to get rid of them and they're hanging around and stuff, and you're like, oh, I wish. I wish they'd go, I'm tired, and that. Well, years ago. When? Literally years ago. Well, ages ago, sort of. I think it said medieval times, yonks. Ago, then yonks again. We're going back quite a bit on this. Well, you know when you find out these books. Well, I just popped down when it was. Just make a note. I don't think it says all the time. It just sort of says, you know, a few years back. Yeah, no, no, it doesn't. Never. All right, I'll make an effort next week. Okay, so. Oh, it's annoying that. Because my girlfriend said to me, just make a note at the time. They'll stop having a go at you. Yeah, yeah. And I kind of thought, oh, all right. Didn't, didn't. Listen, I don't think it matters. Anyway, in this one we're looking at the saying, right? So it's giving someone a cold show. That's shoulder. Shoulder. Right. And what it is, right, ages ago, there wasn't enough houses for people, right, because there wasn't much money being made. You know, they weren't big businesses, people weren't earning good money like they are now. So there wasn't as many houses, right? So what you. What you ended up getting is like, you know, the rich people having a nice place to live and the poor people were, like wandering about, you know, looking for places to live in that. And what they ended up doing is the ad. Like, people would go around to the mate's house and say, look, I haven't got anywhere to live. It's a bit cold. Can you let me stay? Right. So they'd go, all right, then you can stay a couple of days. But they ended up staying for, like, weeks. Yeah, right. So to sort of get rid of them, what they'd end up doing, they'd be making the dinner and they'd be making a lovely dinner, like a bit of meat, nice warm meat and nice veg gravy. This happened every time, did it? This is where the saying came from. This is what happened, Rick. This is every time it was in. That vague book, the book of vague things and stuff. Right. So. So, yeah, so they'd be making a nice meal. But what they did, they looked after all the family. The person who won't go home, they just give them some like sort of a cut off of cold meat. Right. So they'd say, you're giving them the cold shoulder, meaning. Right, okay, that's. That's rubbish. Okay. Absolute cold. Why would that necessarily work? Yeah, yeah. Why. Why do they always. In every situation when you want to get rid of a lodger, well, still feed him every day, but make the meat lukewarm. So he always leave then. Yeah, this food's lukewarm. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna become homeless. And they go wandering. Hold on, are you giving me the cold shoulder? Yes. Do you want me to leave? Yes. Just say leaving. No, I like to do it cryptically. That way in years to come, someone will have a little saying about it. Well, that was. I'll bake on in the morning if you've had enough of me, we'll leave that. I'll be gone in the morning if you've had enough of me, come back. While the others just tease us again with the others. We'll come back to Loose. You've got He's a Bit of a Noose and we'll have a big fire tomorrow. Nice. Looking forward to that. Nirvana and their version of the man who Sold the World. The David Bowie tune. Good, good tune. Good. From that new Nirvana compilation. I like that version. Like the David Bowie version. You can't decide, can you, Rick? You're torn. In fact, I like the Lulu version as well. Is there a Lulu version? Maybe we should play that one. Yeah. Was this recorded, what, in the 70s? I think she recorded it about the same time. Right. As David Bowie. I don't know if he released it as a single. I think it was just on a. Yeah. So off the album. Interesting. Carl is studying. Okay. What's the next one? What's the educating? I don't know. See, like I say, I was looking around and there's stuff that is interesting. I was looking on the web, but there's no point. Well, it's just that I found one about what's the point? About a lad who. Eight years old but he's still breastfed. Now, I don't know if you can get anything out of that. Is that what his mum said? What do you mean? I don't know if I can get Anything out of that? You don't need to. No, it's just that, you know. Where did you read that? That was on the Internet. Oh, well, yeah, you're always unspecific when you mention it. It's just it was on the Internet. Well, I'm trying to think what I put in. I think I put in Y to see if I'd confuse the computer. You are. No, honestly, I did a search putting Y and he came up with funny things that, like, why is this person doing that? And it had a picture of this eight year old lad sort of, you know, on his mum's nipple and it was saying, you know, is this healthy? You sure that wasn't asking you that question? I put in Y just the confused computer going, what do you mean? Stop it. Yeah. Oh, look. Yeah, Last week I was walking home with him, him and I went, he was saying something stupid. Now I've got a competition for next week, let's do a phone in. And it's called Carl Pilkington, Genius or fool. Yeah, right. And he went, no, no. I went, why not? He went, well, they'd be confusing because they say there's no difference between genius and being a fool. No, no, but it's rubbish. And people say there's a fine line between madness and genius and, you know, it's a ridiculous sound bite. They don't say there's a fine line between genius and an idiot. Well, the people who do are idiots. Yeah. So what would you do there though, just to sort of wrap that little thing up? What would you do? That lad loves his mum's. His mum's milk. What are you talking. What are you asking me to come up with? No, I'm just a title for the story. No, no, no, it's just, it's just what would you do? What do you mean, what would I do? Well, it's causing a bit of a problem in the area. What area? In, in America, I think it was. Oh, America a problem, are they? George Bush is worried about this kid who's breastfeeding 8. Imagine it like this, Right? Right. So, Carl, what are you asking me about this furious story you saw on the Internet? I saw on the Internet, this eight year old lady likes his mum's milk and it's saying, is this right? Should he? No, it's not. But what, what do you want Ricky. To do about it? It's not his responsibility. Yeah, but, but the little town that he lives in, they're all causing an uproar, right? Going, this isn't Right. You know, I can't let my kid play out in case he's in the garden with his mum getting a bit hungry. Right? So what should they do? Because his mum's saying, well, he likes it. Yeah. And he, you know what? So what do you do? I don't know. The laws. No, but I'm not asking you to sort out the laws. I'm just saying, if you lived in that neighborhood, what would you say? If you went up to him and said, look, everyone's getting a bit fed up with this. What? What? What? What would I do? What do you mean, what would I do? What are you asking me? Right, it doesn't matter. No, no, no. What are you asking me? What are you asking me? And Steve and the public saying it's safe. You live next door to this woman. Yeah. Right. The kid's hungry, 8 years old, he's out playing on his bike and he goes, ma'am, I'm getting a bit peckish. And he goes, all right. So she whoops one out and he starts having his. Having his milk, right? You live. You live next door, you're putting your washing out and you see this going on. You're getting a bit sick of it because it's gone on for months. Eight years. Why is it your business? Why. Why are you such a nosy neighbor that you're concerned? What would you do, Carl, let's turn it back on. What would you do? What's your solution? What would you do? Well, I thought. But I'd say, right, why are you doing this? And she'd say, because he likes it. And I go, all right, then, put it in a bowl first. And you think that would sort that out? No, because I was thinking about the whole thing, right? And you do that when you're a baby and everything's all right in it. Yeah. No one bats an eyelid. That's a little baby having a bit of milk from its mum's. Yeah. You'd almost say it was natural, but. You grew out of it. It's like you don't see. It got me thinking about things you don't see and you don't see. Did you put this into a computer? Show me things you don't see. What else don't you see? Well, you don't see. Like an old man having a Twix. You never. So what? You know the terrible thing about all this, Steve, is he's right. You don't see a lot. No, I know. That's a terrible. What they have got, right? They've made old man's hoffies, haven't they? They've come up with wor. Is that a song? Oh. Oh, God. You don't see. No, listen now. So they've got their wors, right? Look at him. You think he's giving a lecture at Oxford. It's not going anywhere. No, go on. Sorry. Go on. I'm just saying, right? You grow out of things. Yeah. And the old man, I'm sure when he was a kid he'd have a twitch. Now it doesn't look right. So he's having. It doesn't look right, so right. I don't think Werther's originals were specially designed for old people. I think they were sweets that just happened to have been made for years. That's why old people eat them. They didn't go, hang on, there's a market here. I've noticed old people aren't eating Twixes. Quick, let's make some old man sweets. But the little advert, he gives it to his grandson as well, doesn't he? Goes al Wor's original. It cuts, though, before he throws it back in his face. And get me a Twix and a damn curly whirly. Granddad, you old fool. Electric Six Danger High Voltage on XFM 104.9 sums up the show. Danger High Voltage, Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Urchin and the Amazing Carl Pilkington. So other things you don't see. Carl. Got any other ones or. You obviously been thinking about this. What confuses you when you look out your window? What confuses you with the world? What would you walk around going, oh, that's a bit weird. I remember when you're in Edinburgh, you're confused because you saw someone put in a parking ticket on some rubbish, which confused her. Yeah, that was weird. Yeah. The world's a crazy place. I mean, whatever you look at. Do you know what I mean? Like what? Like what? Well, anything. I mean, you could look out the window there and you'll see something. You go, why are they doing that? Yeah, Doing that for. Yeah, this. Maybe we should bring back White Van Kyle. There's some interesting questions this week, Rick. Yeah, we could pull that out the bag. Shall we do that? Just get Carl's take on the worlds. Let's do it. Let's do it. I'll tell you what, we'll do that in a second. Let's have another educating, Ricky, because I think you got sidetracked with your. Your talk of. Well, just the other thing on things you don't see. Look at the way. When I went to school there was two kids with them big heads now never see them. Sure. Yeah. But no one else saw anyway. Carl, it's only you that saw two of them not related and wouldn't hang around with each other because you think they thought it would be too obvious. Webbed. Webbed fingers and big heads. That's amazing. And there was a kid with the pigeon chest, so. Oh, yeah. And the. And the lady with the head like a bag of spuds. Let's not go through these again. It just raises too many questions that can't be answered. Yeah. Right then, so we've got. We'll have a big fire tomorrow. Yeah, go on. Is that the one you want? Let's go for it. Right. I think this was like around the 1700s. Just bluffing. Who was the king then? Go on. But it's. It's about the word bomb. Bonfire, Right? Bonfire. Bonfire, yeah. Do you know where it comes from? No. Go on. Right, what happened? It's got nothing to do with Guy Fawkes and that. Which is what I thought when I saw it. It's got nothing to do with that. But ages ago at 1700s. Yeah. The didn't have enough houses like I mentioned. Okay. Yeah. So if that happens, you get people living on the streets, you get diseases, people aren't cleaning properly. So you get more deaths. All right? Yep. So think about it. You've got all these dead bodies lying around, they're running out of space because it's like. I don't know, don't know why they're running out of space, but. Okay, they haven't, they haven't got. Got much. I don't know why really. I was gonna say buried him, but there's probably more land back then than now. He doesn't need anyone else in the room. We could leave, we'd come back and he'd go, I'm sorting it. Yeah. Anyway, for some reason they. Presumably if it's going to be they burnt them, it's presumably to do to that it also killed the parasite or whatever's carrying the parasite on them as opposed to burying them and not killing the disease. Well, yeah. So that's that. There you go, you've worked it out. They piled them up and they turned it into a celebration because there was a lot of fed up people at that time. Is this to be the word bond? Meaning Good. No, no, no. I'll tell you in a minute. Go on. So you've got all these people who are, like, going around and, like, oh, you know, so. And so died the other day. And, you know, nearly every week, someone they knew was dying. So you can imagine like. Like, just constant, like, being depressed. So. And they've got all these bodies lying everywhere. It's like, oh, God, what are we gonna do? So they said, we're all too fed up at the moment. Said, let's. Let's make this a better world. This was 1701 by the time they got together. Yeah. So they said, what we need to do is have a big party. So they said, yeah, yeah, you're thinking. So they go, right, well, we'll put all the bodies. Yeah. In a big pile. And they're all diseased and that. They set fire to the bodies and they said, let's have this as a celebration to remember them by. And, you know, we'll have a drink and that and have a chat. We'll have this big fire going. And it came from bone fire. Ah, right. So it was. It was all the bones. Bonfire is bone fire. Yeah. Excellent. Yeah. That's interesting. So that's. That's how it came about. Yeah. In the 1700s. Yeah. That was. No, probably. I reckon it was 1600, probably earlier. I reckon it was the plague. I reckon it came from. But interesting stuff. Interesting. So that's. Did you celebrate Bonfire night? Is that a big celebration for you? Do you like the fireworks? I. Sick of fireworks. I just think it's. They're rubbish. Yeah, I'm. I'm not impressed. I've never been impressed by fireworks, even as a kid. You know, you have to go to, like, sort of community, kind of get gatherings of the bonfire and fireworks and some local vicar or whatever would come out. Pattern. But I also think the adults think the kids love it and if they just got together and said, should we go see it? They'd all go, no. Yeah, absolutely. Let's not go this year. What would be better is if the vicar had wheeled out like a massive rocket. Yeah. Climbed in, gone, last one to the moon is a bender. And then fired himself off. Now, that I paid to see. That's a firework display I'd like to see. As it is, it's just. Oh, dear. Yeah, yeah. I'm not keen. No, sorry. What clue was that? That we'll have a big fire tomorrow. Bone marrow. Bone marrow. Genius. Play record. Oh, God. Speaking. Van Morrison on vocals. That's them and gloria from the 60s. Fact. Adverts. Car. All right. Watch this. Go on, go on. Just get on with it. Because I just can't believe what you just said. What? What we're doing, are we? Final one. Yeah, Right. The last one, like I said. No, no, no, say. Say the record. The record you played. Go on. This is free association. Yeah, brilliant. Yeah. And what did you just say to me just before this was end standing? He just looked. It just looked over at me and went, are there any animals without a brain? Hang on a minute. No, no, no, no. Right, right. And I went, yeah, there's animals that. He went, I wasn't talking about this. But it's sad. There's a lad born without a brain and he laughs a lot. And his hearing and his sight's okay. I'll go, well, that's impossible. If he's without a brain, all that is impossible. When he went, well, it was in the magazine. No, it was in a book that somebody sent. Right. And I didn't want to bring it up because it is a bit sad, really. Now this, you know, young lady. There's a picture of him sat there with his mom and. Carl, Carl, forget it. It's impossible. There must have been more to the story. He can't not have a brat. Hearing and sight is a concept within the brain. That's all it is. Right? The ears are just receptacles. They're just. Yeah, so. But that's why it was in this book. It was a book of mysteries, Carl. You know, if you. If you. If you. If you're reading a book and you see a photo and you guess at what you think the story might be, that doesn't make it true. That doesn't make it. I looked at it because I thought, he looks like an appy, like. Sure. And I read about it and I thought, that's weird. Like you've said, the fact that he hasn't got a brain, but he can see and he can hear. No, impossible. Impossible. Okay, go on. I don't know who to believe. Listen, we haven't done it for a while. White van man. I thought there's some interesting questions raised today and I think it might be nice. I think we've set Carl up again the last hour as a person that people want to know his opinions on the world. Yeah. Yeah. Well, if you're not familiar with it, on Saturdays, the Sun newspaper asked, asks a typical white van driver, questions his opinions on the week's news. And we thought we'd throw these in the direction of Carl. And then. What do you make. What do you make of this teenage thug, Carl, Mickey Carroll, who spent four months in jail and he's won 9.7 million on the lottery. Is that justice? When you think of all the good people that are going hungry and there's a lad there and he's won. Did he buy the ticket before he went in? No, I think he bought it once. He'd come, mate. So he's. He's done his time. He's done his time. Fair enough, then. He's. He's been punished. Yeah, right. He's bought a ticket, he's had a lot of bad luck now he's having a bit of good luck. Next one. Are you concerned that now he's got all that money he could turn into like a sort of mastermind villain, you know, like a James Bond style villain. He's got a criminal streak, we know that. Is that a concern for you? Imagine that he could build some kind of underwater. With my lawyer's hat on. We don't know that. Well, he'd have to prove that he didn't have a criminal streak, I'd say. You've been in jail for four months. Yeah. Sometimes people are bad because they haven't got any money. So he might be interesting. Angel of gold now. Yeah. One in five children aged between 11 and 16 go on booze, binge sessions at least once a week. That's terrifying news, isn't it? Kids, they know. They know too much now. Yeah. Yeah. Listen to this one. Right, Go on. My dad had me niece in the car, right, running her to school one day, and she's in the back of the car with a mate and they chatting away about stuff like kids do, and they got onto the topic of one of the mates who said, I mean, you've got to remember. Nice. This point was probably about five or six, something like that, right, in the back of the car talking about My Little Pony, whatever it is they play with. Subject changed. Oh, that Lisa in our class, she's a lesbian in. Right. That was the top. That's what they were talking about. Yeah, chatting away about it. Just openly talking about lesbianism and probably. You know, this is the topic that they're talking about in the pub when they're having out drinking. Yeah, yeah. But they might have thought a lesbian was a, you know, a funny word or something. You know, the ins and outs of it. Do they? It's weird, though, in it, because when I was. When I was younger at school, you didn't like. I mean, you swore a little bit, but it wasn't like major swear words and you sort of did a little Bit of nicking, but nothing like to get up to now. I mean, my. My girlfriend, when she was about 7 or 8, she was walking to school with her mum and she called her a C U N because she thought it was a big. She said she thought it was a big furry animal. She said she was being nice. Where'd you do that? Where'd you do that? Just heard it at school. So they might, you know, they might not know what it means. Well, I'll tell you, you know, I have to. I'm gonna have to use kind of euphemisms here to tell this story, but when I was at school, I learned, you know, the stronger version, it's not the same word, but it's very similar with one letter change. I'm going to use twit. Yeah. You know the word I'm thinking of? Yeah. But I'm gonna use the word twit to replace it. Right. And I said. I went round. Do you think that's what. Yeah, all right. That's what I think of. And so can I say. Am I allowed to say. It's weird, though, because some people look from Cornwall, you use that, like saying twit. So if people listen, Cornwall, a twit. Is a pregnant goldfish. Well, I learned the stronger version of twit. Yeah. Twat, for those that aren't sure. I learned this in school when I was, like, 10 or whatever. And I didn't know what it meant. I thought it was just a stronger version of twit. I thought it was just if you were really annoyed with someone because they were a real twit. Because I is worse than I. Exactly. Apparently. So Carl would be a twit. And so I started using this at home because I didn't realize what it meant. I started using this at home. Oh, you twit. You're a twit. And send it to my dad. You're a twit. You. You know, not saying twit. And my dad didn't know what it meant either. That's great. I can believe. So he started using it as well. Right. So then we'd be driving in the car, he'd be saying to my mom, you stupid. Do it. Pull over, pull over. You know, saying this that I learned at school from Mark Johnson what it really meant. Yeah. Stopped using it, obviously, finding out it was quite an offensive word. Yeah. Couldn't. I didn't want to bring up to my dad. Dad. I didn't want to sit my dad down and say, dad, you know, that Word we've been saying. Yeah. You know what it means. So now to this day, I've never brought out with him. So we'll be driving, you know, he'll be. I go in for Christmas, we'll be driving around, he'll be calling my mum that word left, right and center. I think she knows. I think she's just embarrassed or she's just upset and she knows what I mean. She goes, why does he keep calling me this terrible word? But he's the only one, I think, in our family who doesn't know what it means. No one's got the guts to say, I don't know whether I should tell him this Christmas. What a twat. I know. Good to hear that again. Always good to hear that. Suede animal nitrate. Carl's all flustered cuz there isn't a record setup and he's getting all tizzy. He's been more worried about his competitions and sorting out, putting records on. Ready? Well, I'm after Steve's song for a Love. Well, I'll tell you what, you. Why didn't you carry on with your Educating Ricky section? I'll have a look on the, on the screen. We'll keep it going, Steve. Yeah, go on, go on then. Right, okay. We've had, we've had a few emails. Anyone got it right, Carl? Anyone? Educating Ricky, that's the final one. We've got to get that out of the way. We gotta get Rockbusters as well though. But we've only got five minutes left. Come on, just do Educating Ricky. Right. God. The, the last one that we haven't done is he's a bit of a nuisance. Go on again. Not really, not really that interesting. Thanks. No, again, I spoke to you in the week and he had much better things like when I tell you about Brian Blessed climbing Everest and for some reason it made him. Played havoc with his belly and he followed through and he had to clean up. Shat himself. Yeah, using ice. Why did you tell. Why are you telling me that Brian Blessed. In what way is telling me that Brian Blessed shit himself once in any way educational? Because I was saying how he was climbing Everest. Right. Give it to him, he's an actor and that. But he gave that a go. Yeah, right. It played. What's the point of that? You'd say, wouldn't you? You'd say, God, he's, he's, you know. Oh, so he's all right. I mean, me doing a boxing match, there's no reason is rubbish. But him climbing Everest and himself. Yeah, he did. It's commendable. Right, and he's only gonna like go and do it again. He's going to climb it again. Yeah, but he might not shoot himself this time. What's the point in going, Nothing's changed up there. Yeah, well, it has. They probably cleared out by now. Right, but it's. Sleep on it. I can't even telling you this one because. Come on, do it or do it now. Steve, how we doing? Look, no, no, never mind that. Look, just tell me what that means. Oh, he's a nuisance. Oh, this is so annoying, Carl. I'm gonna go mental. Talk. Right, listen, I'm just putting. Right, right, nuisance is a bit of a nuisance. Yeah, yeah. Apparently the old fella who used to hang people. Yeah, yeah. He used to be able to tell somebody's weight just by looking at him. Right. That's a bit of a bonus fact. We'll be the judge of that. The thing, the thing that I wanted to tell you. Yes. Money for old rope. Do you know what I'm saying? I can't even be bothered. Yes, you're going to tell me now. Come on, Carl. I mean it. Basically, money for old rope came from the. Right. What was all that about? He can tell someone's way and blind blessed himself. What are you. What? No, don't you. No, tell me that now. You nearly made me swear then. Just. I'm getting really annoyed. I'm getting really annoyed. Night now. Tell me this back, Carl. I'm gonna go mental. Come on time. Trying to know one of people. Years ago when people used to be hung. Right, right. If you didn't like the person who's been hung, you'd go, God, I really don't like him. And, and so you never forget that. If they're being hung, we take that as rare. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So they never forget afterwards to get the hangman to get the rope and to cut it up into little pieces and he'd sell them. It sell the little pieces of rope to people. See that, Carl? That's the most interesting thing if it's true that you've come up with. Right, okay. And so what's, what's. So they sell the rope. They sell the rope and it's money for old rope. Money for old rope meaning like, you know, God, it's easy to make money. All they have to do is cut it up and sell it. I'm seeing a goal. I'm not so convinced. We're really tight. We haven't even Got time for a last stroke? We've got an ad break and we've got to give ourselves out. Okay, give the answers then. This is ridiculous. So, Steve, do you want to pick a winner? I've got a winner when you give us the answers. Okay, so the first clue was that army has got some well nice trenches. Yeah, that was dw. Who's that? Dandy Warhols. The top of them curtains erect, all the material is worn. Hv, that's Holly Valance. Oh, he got a phone call saying, I haven't heard it. And she went. She was. He was talking to her off air and she went, what is it? All right. He said, you know the thing around the top of the curtain is a Palmett, not a Valance. And he went, cut her off. Yeah, but my aunt is always making balances on everything. I'll tell you about that next week. Right. I'm looking forward to that. Is this the one that farted for five minutes? Yeah, yeah, the very same. Yeah. Right, so we'll talk about that. I was in Texas. I tripped up. I landed on my knees in a puddle. Wheel yet? Wet knee, Houston. Right? Wet knee, Houston. Yeah, you're a maniac. So who's a winner? We've got Pete, Catherine and Laura in Newcastle Upon Time. They're listening online, I assume. And they're digital. Those great reasons. Remember, they got loads of stuff. They got the DVD here, they got Linda Green, got Stone Roses. They got another combination and executive decision. What did you read about Brian Blessed? Is it actually true or have you a lie with someone else? It was an interview with him in it. And what did he say? Come on, what did he say? He said I climbed Everest and I played off it with me belly. Let's talk about it next week. We really run out now. Oh, you're a fool.",
