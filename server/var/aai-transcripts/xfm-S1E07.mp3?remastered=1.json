  "text": "We don't know. Yeah. The problem with me is it's like when you multiply anything with naught. Exactly. Nothing ever happens. Yeah. Okay. Shame. And I'm a fat little ugly fella like Reg Varney. Well, there's people there that you don't like and you sort of. You could go up to afterwards and almost like metaphorically flip the bird. What's that mean? Last week. Yeah. Flip red. You dirty. No, middle finger. And. And see, And I married Steve. Single. No. What are you talking about? And there are lots of people there. I thought it was a euphemism. Who you haven't got on with in the past. And then they're all being really nice to you. I'm talking. We get on with everyone. What does flip the bird mean? What does that mean? You've got that hipster thing. The finger. Give me. Skipping the finger. Yeah, but I thought there was a dirty metaphor. No. You're always thinking this. Don't bring me down to your level till at least five minutes. Coming up after the rate we've got Steve and Ricky and lovely Claire. We're driving their desk. Right. Claire. Hello. Don't bend over like that, Claire. Put a longer top on or something. You're up, boys. You're very studious. There we are. We're working hard. Just working out what we're going to play. What? Order. I love the way you even live the pretence. What about some Foo Fighters mixed with the Strokes? Ricky? I wouldn't mind a bit of Strokes. Or New Order. What should we kick in with? Undecided yet, Rick? Probably got some ads to help us decide. That dilemma. That dilemma will be revealed in just under four minutes. Stick around. Merry Christmas, New Order and Crystal on XFM 104.9. Now listen to us. So obviously with Steve Merchant. Well, they like to know. They like to know if I'm here. They don't like to know. The fans do. Yeah. Now, that was one of my favorite singles of the year. Yeah. It's a good song. And that's what we're going to be doing in this program. We are going to be playing some of our favorite songs from the year. It's absolutely true. We're also going to be playing some songs that maybe we don't like exactly. Just for the hell of it. Yeah. Because we're crazy guys. Yeah. We never know what's going to happen next. No. Guess who's pressing the buttons? We genuinely don't. Well, you know who's pressing the buttons. You can see her but the audience. We don't know what's going to happen next. Claire Sturgis. We've got Sturgis in. Claire Sturges. XFM's Claire Sturgis. Yeah, she stayed off it for just a day. She's not. She's just. She's clean for a day. You're Metadone or what you want? No, no, I'm clean now. You can actually clean. Well done, well done, well done. Congratulations. Yeah. Clean for Christmas. That's beautiful. You're still thieving though, aren't you? Still the thiefing. Just can't leave the thief. But at least the money now goes on like, you know, 40 Benson as opposed to a little five pound starter. It's lovely. Y. Sweet. It's nice to see a little. Little miracle for Christmas. Rick, it's beautiful. Yeah, yeah. I'm already in the Christmas mood. Are you in the Christmas mood? The thing is though. What? She's still got left over from it. And these are the scars and the reminders of your smack head thieving days are those little homemade tattoos on her face. Exactly. Yeah. She looks like Seal and see? Handsome Quink. Exactly. Oh, but no. Merry Christmas to you, Claire. Yeah, thank you. Merry Christmas. You're still living in the projects? Yeah, still keeping it real. It's a tiny Tim. I tell you what, she. She's a bit like Jesus Christ in a way. Yeah, yeah. Blasphemous. Please play a record. Linkin park and one of their songs. Gervais. Quick, come on, mate. He's got. He's coming back from the kitchen with a couple of cups of tea. It's like he's won an award. He doesn't care now. I'll turn up if I want to. Maybe we should do a twin spin. Sturges, do you want another record? Here you are, Paul Weller, the changing man. The mod father. That's true enough, as they call him. Absolutely. See now you. You told the listeners that I was just too big to be here because I'd won some award. I was actually making the tea for all of us, wasn't I? It's awful. That's not the point. I shouldn't be making tea. A man, my position. Yeah, you're right. You shouldn't be making tea. It's just awful. What? How do you. How do you actually go about the tea? You understand how a cup of tea is made? You know you've got to put a tea bag in there. No, but this is weird, right? Because I actually can't make a good cup of tea or coffee and it's strange. It must be something metaphysical. I put all the right ingredients in, just like everyone else does and I'll build a cattle. But people do go that. Can I tell you where you're going wrong? Go on. Laziness. Why? Because you literally don't leave the tea bag in long enough. You literally dunk it in there and throw it away. I was trying to get back in time because I wasn't sure. I saw you talking with Dermot O'Diddley, so don't give me that. And I've been around to your house before. There's been times, Sturges, when I've tasted the tea and it tastes like washing up liquid. And I said, what happened? And he went, there were some bubbles in there. Yeah, well, you know, I've rinsed out with some water for a second. Well, yeah, but I resent having to make tea. Yeah, but don't teach me a lesson. You like, don't offer someone a cup of tea and then think, I'll teach them a lesson. They won't be asking for tea again. But, yeah, I've had to go and. Get an extra tea bag and dunk it in here. It's ludicrous. I know, it's mad. It's pathetic. Anyway, it's Christmas. Let's not. Let's not disrespect. Let's get cheery. Can I tell Sturgis what you got your family for Christmas last year? I just remembered when I was outside. Please, please. It was a joy because Gervais is a generous man and he's a thoughtful man and he's got a lot of brothers and sisters and a lot of nephews and. And nieces and stuff. Well, I got about 20 people to get. No, exactly. So it's, you know, it's a tricky business. That's why, I think. Was it you got him Â£200 worth of lottery scratch cards on the. I. I had about a minute. I was getting a lift down to Reading and it was my mate Jimmy, and I went, oh, no, I just got to get the presents. And I just. I ran into the 7:11 opposite me and got Drew. It's the scratch cards that's amazing. It's such a working class dippo gift, isn't it? But did any of them work? Anyone win any? Yeah, yeah. I mean, some people were down. That was a present. Hard luck. That's the risk you take when you accept this present. Some people are up 70 pounds, so they had a great Christmas. Just bear in mind that there's, like, some children who are, like, seven or eight, you know, scratching off scratch cards. They gotta be 18 to claim them. And just the rest of your family, sort of. I can imagine. Just wrestling them off. You can't claim it anyway. No. Have I won? No. No, you haven't. No. I've got three dumbbells. Three? The same. You don't get anything for that. Not in this game. Unlucky. Are you gonna do that again this year? Maybe. Yeah. Mercury Rev, the Dark Is Rising. That sounds a bit like a tribute to Neil Young. Beautiful. I thought it was lovely. We're gonna play some lovely records, some beautiful songs today. All right. That's true. What did you call me then, Steve? Did you call me something else before? I didn't hear. I thought maybe you'd call me, I don't know, Jonathan or something. No, I don't know. I don't know. I did. I didn't hear. I got paranoid. Christmas. We were talking about Christmas. Yeah. Gifts. What's wrong? No, I didn't know what that meant. What, were you having to go at. Me because I went on John's Ross show? No, no, no. I thought you'd said something. You'd said my name by mistake. You'd said someone else's name when you're talking to me, but I didn't hear that. So when I heard you just go, steve, I thought you were correcting a mistake you hadn't made. No. No. Okay. All right. See? Blunder. What did you call me? Fatty. Good. All right. We're talking about Christmas. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it is, because it's just the fact that it's the right time of year to talk about it, to be honest, it's topical. So let's carry on. Go on. Shoot. Well, I just wondered if your Christmas gift buying had always been as thoughtful as it is. Oh, well, no, that was. See, that was actually, even though it was thought pretty lazy and thoughtless, it was quite generous in a sense of. Financially. But I remember. Oh. Oh, God. Now, even though I sort of come from working class family, my dad was, you know, a laborer and my mum was like housewife. But I was spoiled at Christmas. You know, I didn't have, like, pocket money or gifts that. But, you know, she'd get out of a catalog and pay for it for the rest of the year. So I did have great presents. Yeah. And because I had older brothers and sisters, they were earning, so I had good presents and it was okay for me to, you know, give them nothing. Or do a card or something. Rubbish. But then I remember one year when I just suddenly realized I was too old to be doing this. It was like. It was like, you know in Jaws, when it pulls focus. Yeah. And you go, oh, my God. And I just realized that's the worst present you've ever. I think it was about 12 or 13. And I remember it now. My sister had got me a Cat Stevens album. Great. I think a birdhouse and like a quiz book or something. And it was my turn to give her a present. And it was a bottle of shampoo that I'd found in the bathroom and wrapped up. It's a big jumbo. One of those Tesco's, you know. Had it not already been used? No, I don't think so. Mum had bought it. Like, you topped it up with water, wrapped it up. I just. No, I just gave it to her and she went, oh, thanks. I thought, oh, really? That's rubbish. That's really bad. It's rubbish, isn't it? That's really bad. I know, Yeah. I remember one year I really wanted a scaletrics. I was going, what scale? And my mom's going, no, you just get bored of it. I know what you're like. You'll get bored of it and we'll have spent all that money and you'd be bored. I was going, no, I won't. I love it. I love it, I love it. I play with it forever. And I said. And she was going, no, you won't, you won't. And I was, I will. I love it. And so she bought me scale electrics and I unwrapped it and I was using it. I was using it. I was bored instantly. Yeah. I didn't tell her. I pretended I loved it and said, like, I'd always be playing it monotonously, hating it. I know. I'm loving this, Mama. It's actually brilliant. You were wrong. You were so wrong. I'm loving it. I know things are scale electrics. I think it was great at the time, but I think it was an XFM party, actually, years ago when they got scale electrics. And like, loads of us think, oh, yeah, I used to love it. Rubbish. Yeah. Really? It's tiny. It's about 2 foot long. You go, put it back. Put it back on, Dave, put it back on. Exactly. You want it to at least kind of change into a robot or kind of come off and just drive around the course. These days it's all virtual, Steve. That's true, isn't it? In your Mind we all take a. Pill, don't we, Rick? And then we're in some kind of. And then. Yeah, I am Ayrton Senna for a little while. What about those bloody computer games? No one's reading a book anymore, are they? What's a tree download? Well, I'll tell you what, I'm going to play a song now. I think I've dissed you, too, for about 15 years, but I got them wrong. And I'm going to play a lovely track off the latest album. It's the last track on the album, Ground Beneath Her Feet. It's from all you can't leave behind. Beautiful. And it's. I think it's one of their greatest works. Live Forever, Oasis. Still good, that one. It is very good. That's 1993. 94. Long time ago, eh, Core? All those years ago when they were setting out, they were great. And they'd. Oh, yeah. Before they became embarrassing. Well, they might. They can still come back. They can still come back. Their last time was not as good as their. You know, their first one and two and, you know. But, you know, who knows, Steve well, Exactly. Yeah. It's been a good year for hip hop. Rick, can I surprise you? I've gone off hip hop of recent years, but I've. I've been charmed this year by Bubba Sparks's album. I thought it was fun. I think De La Sol had an album this year. Yeah, that was good. I didn't mind the Jay Z album, I see. I like to cut a track on there. I actually quite like. There's a new outcast compilation that I don't know if that's out yet or maybe it's just gonna get. I was disappointed by the album. I bought it on the. Well, Rick, am I surprised There's a new little comp. I like the Owl and the Cat and the Dog. Little compilation. Rick has lots of tracks from their previous albums and other singles. And it's a good little dynamite buy. Maybe something for the new year in the sales. Just gonna make a note of that. I'm gonna buy that on the way home. Do it. But the album that I was particularly charmed by, Princess Superstar, is now. A lot of people been dismissing her as a bit of a novelty. So. Rapper. They said the same about Timmy Mallet, so don't listen to them. Don't listen to them. That's what I'm saying. So another trip we played a while back, Untouchable Part two, which was dynamite. And this is another track. I think this Was a single. It's called Bad Babysitter. She raps very quickly. But listen carefully because the lyric on. And slow it down a little bit. Okay, honey? Now, the name of the restaurant and my cell phone number are on the refrigerator about it. Steve, from the album Princess Superstar is Princess Superstar and Bad Babysitter. Did you enjoy it, Rick? Yeah, I did. Good, good. Yeah, I like that. Yeah. That's two. That's two out of two from the album I've liked. Exactly. I think I'm going to buy the album on the way home. Make a little note. You've got Outcast, which has not actually been released yet, but I'm sure you can pull some strings. I'll. Yeah, I'll get someone onto that. Good. Okay. XFM 104.9. It's the Ricky Gervaise show. Absolutely. Can I stop you there? Go on with Steve Merchant. Thanks very much. No worries. Yeah, cheers. We're talking about presents here. I just remembered something else I had. I was. I was just into science from, like the age of like, 56 to about, so 18, 19. I'm still into it, but I studied it and I absolutely loved it. And I got a microscope set when I was about, I suppose, 10 or 11 and just looking at butterfly wings and just anything under there, like 300 times. Thought this was amazing, right? And in it came these little shrimp eggs. And you could look at them and then you could sort of. You could breed them. You had to put them in salt water solution and then keep them at a certain temperature and they think, oh, and the nice little beach. And they'd come out. What I did speed up the process a little bit. Popped it on the electric fire, right? We had a fake. One of those fake plastic coal things with one of those little metal things that turned around from the heat and made it look like flames. It didn't. I'll be honest. It didn't. Because who the hell was fooled? Yeah. Coming and go. You've got a lovely roaring fire. Yeah, yeah. The flames are encased behind that plastic coal. Exactly. But I love it. Popped them on there. Left in there for a little while. Bit too hot. Came back, just melted, really. Just dry. And the thing was slightly warped so them shrimps did not see the light of day. Once again, your laziness and skillfulness just. I got to speed up the experiment. Absolutely. I. I can advance nature. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Do you stand in front of a. Microwave just going, come on, come on. Yeah. A minute and a half for soup. It's ridiculous, isn't it? Yeah. So majestic. Yeah. But I learned the lesson. Yeah. Now I. I make sure the shrimps are the right temperature. Exactly. That's terrible. You reminded me of something I was going to say then, but I can't remember. I've embarrassed myself live on air. That quiet. No one was there thinking, I wish Steve would say something now. It's crazy story. Yeah, I know what it was. It was about. You said about the. About the sort of the fire and the idea of kind of buying a p. It's like when people buy a fake Rolex watch. Yeah. And they. They tell people it's fake. Utter waste of time. Yeah. You told me that. It's like, what? You're not. I'm getting one over on the Rolex people. You're right. And that's so. But the point is, why buy a fake Rolex watch? I mean, why buy a Rolex watch? They look nice. Yeah. And it's. But it's a transparent display of wealth. But it's when there's like a builder who you knows on like five pound an hour wearing a Rolex. You're joking, aren't you, Steve? Podcast can get upward of Â£550 a day. So you've embarrassed yourself. I don't know anything. It seems like I don't know anything about the building industry anymore. Unbelievable. Do you know, once my friend showed off this watch that he'd bought and a guy had, sort of dodgy bloke had sold it to him on the street. Yeah. And he'd been up in London and some guy on Oxford street had sold him this watch and it looked really good and it worked fine for years and it just looked class. And I thought, wow, that's brilliant. And I came to London for something and I walked up and down Oxford street for two and a half hours trying to get sold a dodgy watch. And I'd be going up to people like selling lighters, going, yeah, not interested in lighters. Got any watches? Yeah. No, I haven't got any watches. Go down to the perfume guy. And I got into the perfume. You any watches? I love the idea that they saw you go down watch and they go, no, it's a bad advertisement, mate. If people see you walk around with this, it's not good for trade. What? How dare you send me one of those stolen watches. I can't do it, mate. More than my job's worth. Ten Benson Blacks now. It's a great tune. I love it. It's sort of punky, but it's got More in common with stuff like Steppenwolf. And my only worry is that. Are they like sort of 18 year olds who like Gomez are trying to sound like they've kind of had a rough hard living life? No, no, they are old 40 somethings. Well, no, no, they're not. They're sort of. But they're. They're dirty. Yeah, good. Do you notice that Steve Taylor, the man with the knowledge, just popped in there to speed us. Merry Christmas. Yeah. And I noticed, Claire, you said something like, has he got another kid? Did you say? Yeah. How many children he got? I think he's got the two now. Yeah, clearly he has got the knowledge, hasn't he? In every sense. Yeah. I imagine he's a great lover. Hey. Well, he knows I'm actually got wonderful fingers. He knows what magic fingers. Well, he's actually got little, little toady hands. Right. He's. He uses a lot of utensils. Yes. He's got, he's invented all these little things that go with. And it just. It's over very quickly so we can get on with learning pleasure gloves. Yeah. Because even when he's making love, there's a stack of trivia books. Exactly, exactly. So, well, he can tell you about kind of great shags of the past. Yeah, yeah. Oh, he's. There he comes. Here he comes. Oh, look, I love him because you don't know this, listeners, but he looks like Penfold. I'm a danger mouse. He does, he does. He hasn't stopped him breeding. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not. You call it breeding when it's humans. Come in, come in, come in. Hey, Christmas tree. Like Steve Wright in his posse. All right. Merry Christmas. Hi, hi, hi. So tell us, are you a great ladies man? Were you a great ladies man before you were married? It's not something I talk about. I'm married now because. Right. Because he's sort of like got a little shaved head and he's got a beard and it's exactly the same cover, sort of. Sort of ginger hair. He looks like a tennis ball. It's just hair. Exactly the same length all over his face. No reason for me to come in was that abuse was happening without me here. Yeah, I know I've come in. You just continue but say hello. So it's with your blessing and I think we're nice say merry Christmas. Hi. Merry Christmas all listeners. See you on at five o'clock, aren't you? Yeah, right. I'm gonna make a note of that. When I bought those two albums, I'm gonna listen to Steve Taylor, the Man with the lords on at 5:00 on XFM. Isn't it incred because he's been in since 11:00 this morning just compiling information for every record he'll be playing. Yeah, the show's only 20 minutes long. But, you know, with him it's because he's got to offload it. Yeah, he's got to talk about all the time because it's only, you know, he's got a huge brain. It's warm information playing Next. Claire, you bored? Sorry, we'll be boring you, you two. Oh, it's just that list. Isn't that cute? Yeah. So can you tell us about Star Sailor? What do you know about some interesting facts about Star Sailor? Into the microphone, into the micropole that goes down the laudy box and out to the radiograph in the homes all around Eng Lloyd. They're rubbish. Thank you. Steve Taylor, Controversial view. Still, he has bred people hives. Hives before that, Star Sailor. It's been a bit of a punk sort of show, this, isn't it? In the year, you know, the whole year has been a little bit of a. I blame the Strokes, but you see, I. I enjoyed punk. You were too young and don't care for it. But I have to say that if. If punk the first time around was as exciting as I found it this year, then I. I've missed out because I've really enjoyed it, really. So I want to go and play you all. All things like. And, you know, things like that. Now, are they as kind of melodic. Though, as things like the Strokes and. And White Stripes and so on? Are they kind of tuned for the White Stripes? In fact, I've picked a very bad example because they were sort of like pop punk and Polystyrene was almost. She wasn't a. Wasn't a joke. But they had saxophones and stuff, so it's not. It's probably a bad example of Ernie. I mean, just. I mean, the Sex Pistol summed it all up. Yeah, sure, sure. But. Well, we enjoyed that, don't we? No, we did, we did. I have to say that although there has been a nice bit of sort of punky sound this year, for me, it's been very much a year for the geek. You'd have thought I'd enjoy metal, though, isn't it? These people in their bedroom playing sort of computer games and loving over the world. It's just mad, isn't it? It's absolutely huge. Suddenly Linkin park and. But see, I don't mind things like, you know, Marilyn Manson because they're, you know, they're having a go, they're having a bit of a laugh and, you know. But it always seems so parentally uncool to me. When I was younger, anyone who was into that kind of music, I just thought, loser. And that's. I mean, that's coming from calling the pot black. Yeah. Imagine that. It's the year of the geeks. Not just because of new metal, but also kind of just these fantasy films with the Harry Potter stuff and now Lord of the Rings. It's like everyone's obsessed now. It's cool to play Dungeons and Dragons now. I can't get over it. I'm stunned. Scary, isn't it? I was never into that rubber. I've always thought it's. It's like. Yeah. It's like people who are still obsessed with Harry Potter, they go, I'm rereading Harry Potter for the third time. And I think, listen, I haven't read it. Okay. I'm sure it's very good, but you're rereading it for the third time. There are books out there written by adults, for adults, with, like, sex and other exciting things. Yeah. And it's Harry Potter. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'll just read, like, in case you missed something the first time. But maybe they're learning the spells. I just. I'm stunned by it. I mean, I. Have you read it all, Claire, are you all up on this? Well, I actually went out and bought the first Harry Potter book and lost interest halfway through because there was no sex in it. It's like why I never go to see any Disney films. There's never the prospect of any nudity. If that's. If there's no chance. I think you're buying. I think you're actually buying the wrong books. Right. What you want to buy, Steve, is a pornographic magazine. Tell me more. Wow. In there, you see what you get. Ladies. Other ladies. Sometimes ladies. New D ladies, Sometimes ladies. Stereophonics. And the theme tune to BBC2's the Office. Handbags and Glad. Absolutely. So I think we should be playing Christmas songs as well, though. A great. Great. Is it really? What? The theme tune to the Office, I. Think I meant is. Yeah, I think. Is war really over? It is. Thanks, John. It is, yeah. Yeah, it is. Yeah. That's what worked there. To be fair. Rod Stewart did it first. Yeah. And we don't use the Stereophonics version. No. Or the Rod Stewart version. Too expensive. Exactly. To re record it. Yeah. Yep. A little known facts. Yeah. You should save that for the DVD. Or Steve Taylor would have blown it anyway. Would need to come up with the knowledge and told him everything. I was thinking Fairytown, New York. Beautiful song. Can we find it? Be nicer to dig it. I'm sure everyone's playing it at the moment. Yeah. Yeah, but I mean we should. It's good. Let's play Simply Having a Wonderful Christmas Time by Paul. Driving home for Christmas. Chris Rea. Oh, he is. There's a lyric in that that goes. Look at. He's in. In the car, driving for Christmas and he looks over the bloke, the other car, he goes, he's just the same as me. Yeah. I was thinking, he's just the same as me. Is he saying he's copied him? He's the one. Why are you wearing. That's the same as me, that is. What'd you get? Your misses the same as it. Do you. Who are you? A stalker? I'm Chris Rhea. Hello. Yeah. He's going back to Newcastle. Exactly. Are they talking it? Is that where he's from? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is it Middlesbrough or Newcastle or. Do you remember when Ria made a Cleveland. Go on. Chris Ray made a film. They all do it. Like Dave Stewart made that film with the All Saints. Honestly, no one went to see it. But Chris Rear made a film which was like a kind of fantasy thing. I think Shirley Bassey turned up in it where he was. Have you ever seen this? No, but. Oh. Oh, no, I can't tell. That's clearly off air. Really? Is it outrageous? Is it libelous to Chris? No, no. I had to interview Chris Rear about this. Really. Shirley Bassey was there and she. And she pulled up in her limo. Yeah, don't ask me, don't ask me. It was for some satellite. No, no. Know that when Bassey came into Pinewood Studios, when she came in, we all had to leave the set so she could drive through the set. We all had to leave so she could drive in. No, just tell you that. It's very boring. I wish I hadn't told you that. What do you mean she drove her car into the set? No, she was driven into Pinewood Studios, into wherever they were filming and we had to all leave as she arrived because. I don't know. Did she do what you do? She didn't like me. Yeah. I don't want that. Smack it out in here, you know. I got some valuables in here. Yeah, yeah. Sturgis Diamonds are forever. And especially when she's around. Yeah. Anyway, I never saw the film, Steve, in answer to your questions. Yeah, well, I don't think anyone did. But the fact that Chris re got money to make a film, I mean, has he released a song for years? He's still going. He's probably got a little bit of back catalog going. You mentioned Paul McCartney as well. We're talking about that with Steve Taylor. And I'm wondering because, you know, it's money and the fact he's got loads of wealth and that's fair enough and he obviously deserves it. But what I'm wondering is Eve's got me such a. Does anyone deserve it unless they spread it around? Politics. Politics. But he's obviously. I mean, he must be one of the richest men in certainly in this country. And I'm sure, you know, internationally, millions. I don't know if he's reached the billion mark yet, but I'm wondering to myself, why doesn't he spend some of that money making his misses? Like a bionic leg? That'd be amazing. Do you know what I mean? She could like leap over buildings and stuff. That'd be. Well, she wouldn't leave. She'd hop. Because if I had that much money, I would. She could only hop. She'd just be running around in a circle. She'd win one sports games, wouldn't she? It's. Go easy, just one hop. She's one. I mean, it'd just be incredible because. I don't know, I mean, the bionic man. It was. It was expensive then, wasn't it? Six million then, Steve. Christ knows what it would cost now with inflation. $6 million. Of course, that's only about Â£4 million sterling. Yeah. But now. And that was like. What was that, 74 or something? It cost you a fortune. Oh, I wouldn't even want to guesstimate. But he's got. He got the. He got the eye. Sure that's useful. Yeah, he can. Well see miles away. He's got the two legs. You need the two legs for running. Did he have the two legs? Wouldn't it be. Yeah, of course he did. Otherwise he'd be hopping, wouldn't he? Yeah, but he got the one arm. It need the one arm. They thought, that's not mad. It's not my complete b. But the one thing that I always worried me, right, was that when he lifted up a truck with his one good arm, why didn't his back collapse? Yeah, yeah. He didn't have a bionic spine, did he? Sure. I could see. I could see him Lying on the ground and sort of like doing this sort of leg press. That'll be fine. But when he stand up his leg, his back would just collapse, wouldn't it? Yeah. So you're beginning to wonder if an astronaut who fell out of a. An airplane while test driving it and was rebuilt as a half robo spot. You're wondering if there's maybe some flaws in that. Yeah, an Oscar Goldwin. I don't know what. And isn't it convenient that his girlfriend are the same? Two legs, one arm. I think that's what drew him closer together this time. She had the ear. I don't think he was just on the pull. And by chance he got her undressed. He thought, my God, that does. That looks like a familiar plastic arm. And there was a bionic dog, wasn't there? And a horse apparently. Why do you need a bionic horse? I know when you can run at 70 miles an hour, you don't need to get on a horse, do you? Unless the bloke had the bionic horse, wasn't bionic and he could run like really. I think the problem was that they'd spent so much money on all these bionic things, they just made a bionic horse. Entered it in races. Yeah, Money back. Yeah, exactly. Steve Austin, he's not. He's not turning up. He's swanning round a very costly investment. Does anyone remember Bionic Man? Is this just. Yeah. This was all shown again on Bravo. Everyone knows who the bionicle. Oh. Just can feel about it. Oh, but he loves it. Campfield's only about 14 and he knows I know. Yeah. He's watching it for 13 and a half years. Sturgeon, let's put another song because we just played the COVID version of HAM magazine. Great song, really good. And I've been playing cover versions all this year and one of my favorites was this one I played. I played a long time back actually. I think I played this when we were standing in for Dramato Diddly. Yeah, he was back today when he just pops up when he wants. Exactly. But I'm not gonna play any cover versions in the new year. That's Cover me Up or Call Me Bad Run for cover. Well, I've finished with my. I call it film review. Yeah, yeah, sure. So we're gonna have all new features in the new year. Yeah, but this is. I'd love to play this again. This is a once round the block as done by the kings of convenience. Play this, Claire. Lovely. I think a short lived kind of new folk Movement wasn't there this year. That kind of came and went. And the Kings of the Convenience were supposed to be part of that. And their album Quiet Is the New Loud, I thought was an absolute treat, and a lot of people just sort of ignored it. Lovely, lovely track. Lovely version that was never actually on the album. That was from the Toxic Girl single, and that's Once around the Block by Badly Drawn Boy, as done by the Kings of Convenience. Beautiful. This is great. And it coming in just like playing songs. Oh, man, it's a lovely, lovely show. Do you think the listeners enjoy this as much as we do? I would imagine not, no. I don't think so either, no. But does that make us bad people? No, I don't think it does. It makes us wealthy people and lucky. Very lucky. That's true. P.J. harvey. Lovely, lovely love. Great, great. I'm loving this, Steve. Yeah, Nearly Christmas, I had a couple of chocolates there, didn't I? Oh, the purple ones in roses. Very much like the Quality street one. The hazelnut and the toffee. Yeah. But get me in the mood. Now, I know if you're a fan like me, you love the roast dinner. Oh, we love the roast dinner, but the uber roast dinner is the Christmas dinner. Oh, I'm looking forward to it. Now. I can't believe how many different sort of meats you're gonna have in your house. Well, we always have the turkey, obviously. Plus we always have a little bit of pork, a little bit of lamb. Oh, God. And don't. Don't forget the sausage, you know? Well, I love the fact that someone's designed the turkey Christmas dinner, and then they thought, wait a minute, I also want a little sausage, and let's wrap it in bacon. Why not? Let's just have a stuff in it. Can we have something? Can we have all the meats that are available? Someone said, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. There's sausage meat in the stuffing. They went, well, sue me. Yeah, exactly. Sue me if I want a bit of extra sausage. You know what I mean? It's the. It's the greatest. It's the work of art, and it takes hours. Rick, can I ask you what kind of veg you going with this? You veg? Well, I just love the roast potato. I mean, people have tried to sneak in the Brussels because you don't eat vegetables or anything. Parsnip. Parsnips. I love parsnips. But when they're crisp and crunchy, like a. Like a. Like a trendy crisp. Yeah. In a wine bar. I love it when you. Yeah. Oh, I love that. Can I. We'll be having carrots, we'll be having leaks. We'll be having Brussels, obviously. Yeah, Brussels, yeah. And my mum will always throw in a little bit of something crazy. Maybe there'll be a little bit of red cabbage, something wild, or a used condom. To be quite honest, I think she's mental, your mot. She's got to stop that, but who knows? Any kind of. Any kind of treats I'm looking for, I'm just so. And I love the fact about the Christmas dinner is that people are taking weeks, years planning it. I know. They take, you know, months. Have you told. Could you talk about your grandparents? Well, my grandparents, of course. The thing about my grandparents, I have mentioned this before. Yeah, I love this. I think they've got about three teeth between them. It's unbelievable. My grandfather, they're all their own, though. He was in the RAF in the war, right. And he, for some reason he had problems with his teeth and they. They pulled them all out, replaced them with a false set of false teeth. But during the wartime, I don't know whether this was just like what it was like during the war or just the 40s, but he had a kind of wooden plate put in with like some kind of fake teeth attached. Oh, no. And he's never had that changed. So, you know, he still got the wooden plate and about three teeth still hanging on it. So he and my grandmother combined. They cannot eat anything that's kind of solid. So they will literally get up for Christmas dinner. They'll get up and they'll put the meat on like it's six in the morning, go back to bed for the day, get up and eat it about 9:00 at night. And they. And the best compliment you can have if you've cooked dinner for my grandparents is, oh, this is lovely. You can suck it away. Yeah, imagine that. Imagine. Why don't they just liquidize it? Have a nice little roast smoothie they. Have done in the past. Really. And a little apple crumble smoothie. If we take them out to. If we take them out to eat, like at a restaurant or something, we've got a phone ahead to make sure there's fish on the menu. Really? Because they can only have fish. But then the bones, you see, that's a problem for them. Well, you can take the bones out of fish, can't you, and sort of mash it up. Yeah, but the eyes are going, steve. Steve, could I suggest the fish Cake. It's already mashed. It's with the potato. It's in a crispy crumb, which doesn't hurt anyone whether you got teeth or not. Rick, can I go on? Make a little. Yeah. I just want to make it because obviously not everyone's as fortunate at Christmas. What about the vegetarians? What are they eating? A nut cutlet. Lovely little nut cutlet. Can't they have, like, tofu, but in the shape of a turkey? But I love the fact that so often, you know, Certainly your Linda McCartney veggie items, they always try to fool you into thinking it's the real thing. You know, some veggie sausages, they've injected with something so they'll taste like sausages. Yeah. Which is a real thing. You don't really need it. That arbitrary shape if it's. But you might as well just have it. Any shape. What angers me with the shape. Couldn't you. What makes me the vegetarians and the vegans even worse is that, look, we're breeding all these animals to be eaten. Yeah. They're gonna get slaughtered anyway. Chow down. Come on. Those chickens in those little kind of pants pens, you know, four of them in a little square box. Yeah. You know, I mean, they're crapping eggs out every couple of minutes. Yeah. You're not a zoologist, are you? I am not officially, no. But I know what I'm talking about. Yeah, you do. I've seen brochures. Yeah. Yeah. I've walked past a farm while on holiday. Excuse me, farmer. Could your finest hens crap me some eggs for my tea? Crap a little egg for me old Christmas class. Oh, no, it's fair. I thought for the vegetarians and worse still, the vegans. Yeah. And what about Travis? What do you think they'll be doing this Christmas? I'm a whale of a time. I'll tell you what, Steve. It was an excuse to play the record. It was a link. Travis and Driftwood on XFM 104.9. It's the Christmas edition of the Ricky Gervais show with Steve Merchant. Hi. I'm loving it. Yeah, it's good. I'm in the Christmas spirit, actually. Yeah, yeah, definitely. I do enjoy. Will you be looking forward to. I know everyone talks about it, Rick, but Christmas, Tennessee telly. I love Christmas telly. Christmas day tell. It's got. I get up and Noel's giving out some presents around hospitals and that. And then you might have a. The. The. The number ones of the year from top of the pot. Then you might Have a little. I don't know, I don't watch the Queen speech, but you know, have a little sleep then, don't you? Maybe after a big roast dinner with too many sausages. Yeah. I'm only joking, Mum. Let's have some more. More chocolate, please. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, that's not. You know, there's people starting in the world, so let's not rub it in. Hopefully they're not listening to the radio. No, probably not. Just scrabbling around in the cold. In the dirt looking for food. We are actually laughing about it. We actually. We actually laugh, Rick. I find that if I laugh about it then I can ignore the problem easier. Yeah. Not face up to the horror. Yeah. I know that that's too easily done. Is it? Exactly. It's too easy to face the horror of the world. It's better to laugh it off. I know. That's what annoys me about buskers. Because a beggar just sits there and you can pretend you haven't seen him. There's a busker's shouting out, yeah, you want to go. You know. You know, Unless you're blind. He knows. Yeah, he knows. Yeah. Yeah. So have you cultivated a kind of universal. I've got cultivate this kind of thing I always do with a beggar. When they offer their hand, I just. I don't even say anything anymore. I just sort of. Kind of offer up my hands as though to say, look, I have no money in my hands and just a kind of. A kind of sympathetic turn of the head and I sort of mouth some words like. And it normally involves sorry, mate or something. Yeah. Because I find it's better to be courteous than like kick him in the head or anything like that. Yeah. No, I never do that. And I always acknowledge them. I never. I actually never ignore them. Them. And. And sometimes I give. Depending on. Or. Although I have to say, another situation. Another successful year for me of avoiding the Big Issue salesman. I've never bought a copy of the Big Issue. I love the fact you are actually proud of that. Well, it's. It got to the point where, where I. I actually am a poor by myself. But it's like. It's a contest now. It's like I've managed to do it for so long that it's like. It's almost a competition with myself. It's the same as me with reading a novel. But. Yeah. Although I blew that in 1987 when I catch you in the rye. I'm still kicking myself. I. I'm looking Forward, of course, to. I'm hoping it'll be Dennis Norton's laughter file, volume seven. Oh, seven. You're having a laugh. 27. It used to be. It'll be all right on the Night, but I think they changed the name to Dennis Oren's Laughter. It's great, though, isn't it? Because he comes. You're one of those people. This is somewhat. We call Doorstop. And it's sort of like just. What? Yeah. And doesn't he just go into the. Direction called Let Sleeping Logs Die? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just. Oh, God. What I don't understand is why people, why no one has said to him, or why hasn't he watched that tv? Why isn't he at Christmas, Right? He's gone home with the family. He's watched. He's gone. Come on, everyone, let's watch my show. He's watched it after file 27. That's the family must have been faking laughter. Why is he not talking? Why did no one tell me Crap. Why doesn't he go to Greg Dyke and go. Or whatever. It's on. Just watched me on that laughter file. 27. It's rubbish, isn't it? And they go, yeah, okay, well, why didn't you tell us? Why? We thought. We thought it would kill you, to be quite honest. But why didn't you let my son take over or Summer? Well, Dennis, he's. He's 84. How old am I then? Well, we don't know. We. We've had you carbon dated, but it's off the scale. But why'd you let me carry that stupid file? Are you reading this now, Dennis? I can't remember what I got to say. Well, don't do. Just. Just speak normally. Two coffees, please. Wait, no. This is what we call talking to the director general. Stop it. But I can't wait for that. Yeah. And there is two. Two. Can I just say one? Who's in the audience of Dennis? Who's got. Who's gone? Joan, I got two tickets for Laughter File. I can't believe my laugh. I've been on the Internet because they. Always love the cracking up, the people. I've never laughed once. Maybe it was an audience that they filmed in 1973. What is the first time they saw a goalkeeper get hit in the balls or something? Or Jackie Charlton or something, or. Or a dog fall off a slide. Well, it's people. It's either old people who just can't remember. They've already seen those clips a thousand times. Before. Yeah. Or it's. I was always thinking of the people. It's. What's that show that Beetle used to do, the. You've Been framed. I think now what's happening is, while Lisa Riley's doing all the scripted jokes, there's just. Someone stood behind. They were just showing a picture of her. Like nude or in a bikini, or just pointing and just making jokes at her expense. Exactly. That's why they're laughing. He's lovely. Lisa Riley off Emmerdale. Of course. Fatty Riley. No, don't say it's not fat. It might be. Glad you don't know. It could be glandy. No, just stop it. You can't say. I don't know, I've gone a bit crazy. I just got. No, no, but she. What if she's listened to this and she gets an eating disorder or something? Or, you know, because bulimic. Because what you. She's probably her own binging now. She's leaving out the vomit and she can't get her fat fingers in her mouth. Anyway, I'll tell you what, the best. Gig of the year, surely. The White Stripes. Rick. I know everyone's raving about. And this here, one of their tracks. What's it called again? Claire Fell in Love with a girl. Hoax. Kirsty McCall, Fairytale New York. We're just saying. It's just a brilliant song, isn't it? It's genius. It's genius. And what I love is the fact that it was quite a big hit. And it's like sometimes even a majestic song like that that normally would get overlooked, just manages to drift up to the surface somehow. And even, you know, the white track. The imagery is great as well. How can old slut on junk be romantic? Amazing. Well, we're fans. Yeah. Sturgis. Thought he was talking about her. Leave it, Sturgis. You're clean now. Yeah, well, we got. We've got more treats after this. We've got something. Ladies. Yeah, we're going out of sync area. We're going to play Song for the Ladies, the penultimate track, because I want to leave them with a Christmas classic, the Jodie Mitchell classic River. So look forward to that. Absolutely. It's been a great show. It has. Even though I say so myself. Yeah. You know, I've enjoyed it, looking back over the year, forward to Christmas. Go on. Can I just throw a thanks, a big thanks out to all the people that have emailed us and phoned in and written to us things. I think it's about four people who keep Doing it. Recycling. The same under different names, though. Exactly. But we don't. We don't tend to read stuff out. But it is appreciated. It is. And it often gets into the show, whether you know it or not. Exactly. In some way, we still off steal your jokes and pass them off as arrows. Not nice email from someone there saying, there is a tofurky. Tofur toy. Yes. A tofu turkey. Yeah. You can buy it in the whole trimmings. See? And I. I made that up. I could have written that down and what had already been done. Yeah. So. Said we can't paint in the tofuri. Sure. So I've embarrassed myself again. Sturgis, are you going to be driving home for Christmas? No, I'm going to be. Christmas. I'm going to be here. God, she's working. He's just the same as me. She's working on Christmas. Oh, yeah, I'm here. Yeah. Someone emailed me the other week saying, will I be voice tracked over Christmas? Well, I'm not quite sure. It's a radio term, apparently. But no, I will be live. Wow. On Christmas Day. Oh, yes. Christmas Day. So you can't drink and stuff. Well, not. Not as much. Yeah. Yeah. You would have liked. I mean, you're always drunk on there, obviously. Yeah. But it's getting that point. I didn't know she drank till I saw a sober one day one Sunday morning when she came into doing any show and she was talking differently. Yeah. She went, the pub's not open yet. Exactly. And I realized. It's terrible, isn't it? Well, what should we play now? I don't know. What. I kind of felt like we've sort of exhausted ourselves, really. We've run out of stuff to say and we passed. We've made all our observations about Christmas. Yeah. We've taken a sideways glance at the sausage. Yeah, exactly. This year's stuffing. Remember we talked about stuff. Do you remember that? It was. I think it was four links ago. Yeah. No, no, listen. Do you remember we're gonna call it sausage loving. And we talked about all the different things you have on a plate and that. We started off with like, turkey and then we went. I just want to remember some of the amusing bloopers that took place over the course. Remember when you didn't make it back in time for the link and you were making tea? I was making tea. Oh, God. What was that one when I think you said something like. That was a right stripe. White stripes. He's gonna say the word wrong or something. Oh, God. If you're one of those people. Oh, this is great. I'll tell you what, I'd like to play a record because I'd like to talk about this link later. Yeah. Should we play a record? Yeah. Well, let's look back on it, like, you know, amusingly, like, I love 1980. Oh, let's do that in a second. So I'll play a song for the ladies, final one of the year. And it's a song which I did play a long time ago and it's absolutely beautiful. It's from Nick Cave's album. What was it called again? I think it was called no More Shall We Part. And it's an absolutely magnificent. I'm just remembering the last time you played it. I know, yeah. It was brilliant because you. You introduced it and then I think it was Carl who played it and we listened to it. Well, we. Were we playing Buckaroo or eating Curly Whirly at the time? I can't remember. I was on a space. Oh, Cave in the Bad Seeds, Love Letter. Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Well, I'm loving this, but we've. We've got a go soon. Sadly, the clock has beaten us, Rick. But it's the last track that we're gonna play this year. It's a lovely track. It starts off with a little bit of Jingle Bells that we're getting, a little bit of tribute on the piano. It's Joni Mitchell and the River. Enjoy. We won't be back next week, will we? Or the week after? No, we're back on the 12th. Yeah, you. Right, guys, I've got some back timing to do now, so you got 20 seconds. Yeah, okay. Well, that was Jo. She's getting a bit grumpy, ain't she? No, no, I'm back timing to the football. Yeah, she's. Yeah, yeah, got 15 seconds. This is christmasy. Cold turkey, mate. That was Joan Mitchell and the River. Thanks for listening, everybody. I hope you enjoy the shows. Don't take anything to say too serious. I hope we haven't offended anyone. We don't. We love the home. Listen. And fat birds, don't. We love them. Christmas Eve. Happy Christmas. She needs her fix. She needs her fix. She's all grumpy.",

You had to put them in salt water solution and then keep them at a certain temperature and they think, oh, and the nice little beach. And they'd come out. What I did speed up the process a little bit. Popped it on the electric fire, right? We had a fake.
