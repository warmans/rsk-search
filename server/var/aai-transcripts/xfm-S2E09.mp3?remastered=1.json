Yeah. I don't know if I'm hungover or still a bit drunk. I don't feel. You sound like you're still a bit drunk. Yeah. So what I'm worried. You do every week, so. But what I'm worried about is the. The standard will slip. Yeah. I'm not right on the ball. And the other thing. Had a lot of time to prepare the show today, so I don't. And I. And I. I don't really. I don't feel, you know. 100. Yeah. I haven't done the car. Right. Look, have you finished that sentence? I. Don't make me laugh because it hurts as well. And the other. The other. There's another side effect to me being a little bit hungover and. And. Or drunk, whatever, is that I can be annoying, right? Yes. Yes. Because I just. To amuse myself, I sort of, like, turn my body off a little bit and just poke and annoy people and that. I want to. I want to sort of like. Well, you do the physical equivalent of freewheeling. I sort of want to climb on Carl and go to sleep on him. Yes. Do you know what I mean? Both annoy him and it'd be comfortable. Yes. Which is, you know, can be annoying. A quick. Just a little thing, just to make this show a bit easier, if you'd put your hand up when you went one. One of us to speak. Because it's not quite. I'm not quite sure when. When the sentences are finished. The hands are up. Okay, good. So the hands are up. Okay. Okay, good. All right. Okay. You're gonna just keep up the rest of the show or. No, like, Carl, do what you've. What you. Huh. Good. All right. Do you want to. I mean, is there an excuse as to why you're a bit hungover? Too much wine. Okay. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Good. Okay. Because this is the only. I mean, this is the only work you've got to do all week, isn't it? Unless I'm very much mistaken, you don't have to do anything. You just sit at home eating. Eating cheese. And then occasionally you do a bit of sort of shadow boxing, and that's exercise. And then you sit and watch tv. Is that roughly what you did this week? Yeah. So this is the only two Hours. You had to do anything for all week. This is you had to prepare for. Yeah. Who can plan a hangover? Right, Carl, you said you had some stuff. Yeah. What have you got? I love the fact that whereas I was a little bit slow, Carl there leapt into action to keep this show afloat, keep the pace up. Go on. Right. Well, Carl, are you hungover as well? I'm just a bit annoyed because I'm with you. Do you know what I mean? He hasn't got much to do all week. You're having a laugh. What. What angers me is I. I kind of hope that maybe I could have quite a long career in radio. And I sort of feel like I'm. I don't know the word sinking ship. Those words spring to mind, but because it feels like. I mean, Carl, you're just a chancer anyway. You weren't even supposed to be on air. And you. We've made you into something of a household name and that's cool. And Ricky's already a celebrity. He's got it stitched up. He's got corporates, he's got, you know, voiceover work. But I've got nothing. I'm running on empty. I got. I. You know, I'm not nothing. I've got nothing. I'm sort of dependent a bit on this. Yeah, financially. And you two are sort of bringing it down, really. Right. Do you reckon I can get my own show? Carl. Carl. Carl, no. Carl, Carl, tell him how funny I was without there with a bit in that a minute ago. So anyway, come on board of this. Tell you what, will we tease them with what we've got coming up next? Yeah, tease us after the next because. I think we've already got them for two hours. Yeah, we've hooked him, Carl. Don't worry. This is textbook reading. What's this? Baby bomb Boy. Yeah. Badly drawn boy. You were right. Xfm 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Carl, you were saying, what's coming up? Right, over the next two hours, then? Last week was a bit of a mess. Don't be silly. So I've sorted it out. We'll be doing the same features. Right. We've got. I think that was the reason it was a mess. If I wanted to. Well, you've tightened it. You tightened it. You tightened the ship. Tightened it up. And also keeping people for longer. Okay, Right, tell me your plans. What have you come up with? Tell me your ethos behind this, then. Always show your workings, Carl. Always show your Workings, Carl. All right then. So last week we started good sort of play on words that we had going. The well known film Educating Rita. Yeah. That's become, thanks to Carl Pilkington's brain, it's become. I've tweaked it a bit and now it's Educating Ricky. Brilliant. Right, and that was a new feature we started last week, if you weren't listening, where I teach Ricky stuff. What did you teach me? Taught you about that little Chinese hairy kid? Yeah. You didn't teach me anything. You said there was a kid that was born that was slightly hairy, where. The saying chewing the fat came from. That was good, that was interesting. And. And a man who had a beard being abducted three days. Again, that was rubbish. Lest we forget that taught me more about you than about alien abduction. But what happened last week is. Go on. We sort of talked about it all in one go and you can't. Whereas this week you've done what, you've spread it out over the show? Well, I've spread it across the two hours because I always found that if you try to be taught too much in one go, you just can't take it in and it'll be wasted. Is that your experience of school? They taught you in three minute bursts. And not every day? Yeah. Every other when you felt like it. Yeah. Right, so that's what we're going to do. Right, so we've got Educating Ricky coming up. Educating Ricky across the two hours. Okay. And what I do is I've made little headlines again and you decide which story you want to go for first. Well, give me the first headline. No, no, not yet. We'll do that. We'll give me a teaser. Hang on a minute. I'm telling you what else we've also got. We've also got. We started it last week, Rockbusters. Oh, yeah, that was a triumph. Yeah, I think we went wrong there. Why? By letting you do it, Doing it on air, not thinking it through. Yeah, bit of that. Okay, so what's the rules on Rockbusters? We're gonna do Rockbusters but you email in ricky. Gervaisfm.co.uk when you know the answers. Okay. Right. And sort of round near the end of the show. Right, we'll give out the answers then. So if they think they know the answers, they've got to hang about. Rick, I should tell you now, I'm not hanging about. Don't think that. Don't think that the listeners are going to go away empty handed because there's. I Was right about that. I can tell you where, don't worry because Carl has sorted out some top quality prizes. First up, this is stuff that people can win and be excited about this. First up, it's a DVD of the Office. I don't know how he got hold of it. I don't know how he got hold of it because they're like gold dust. Yeah, yeah, There's. This is the second gift. Now bear in mind, this is. I don't know where he's rummaged up from. This is an XFM compilation album. He's managed to sort that out somehow. I don't know how he sorted that out. There's another compilation album which has got some sort of indie type hits of these. But this is. Oh, you got a film to give away. Well, I'm glad you've asked film though. Because I know you're a big fan of DVDs. Yeah, it's one of the big hot releases that everyone's keeping their hands on. Not arbitrary. It's not the only one. This film title. Don't be an arbitrary film, will it? It'll be a big. Rick, I don't want you thinking that the film that Carlos sorted out is that he sourced for us is just an arbitrary thing that you. That you wouldn't get. You could buy for 3.99 in HMV. Yeah, right. They're giving you those big baskets. Exactly. I don't know who is phoning up to try and win this, but you can be. If this is your favorite film, it's yours. Exactly. Okay, but this is. Yeah, this is the big. The big star prize. It's the one you're all playing for. It's Children of the Corn. Stephen King's Children of the Corn. It's a wide screen, A widescreen presentation on dvd. Imagine getting that and going, excellent. We can watch this now. But Rick, I mean, let me just run through some of the cast. Peter Horton, Pete Horton's in it. And that. I'll tell you what, I don't want to give it away. If Hort is in it. I'd love to see his performance in it. Also Linda Hamilton. I know. You're all she pays. She plays a piece of corn. Exactly. And I don't know. Well, I don't have not seen Children of Corn. I could be wrong, but. Around the office, why do you start throwing like a mouse mat and a pair of scissors and a pencil? Because that is just arbitrary. That's an arbitrary selection. That's next week's stuff. But Also, I should say we also have some. This is a little bit more exciting. We've also got some tickets for DJ Shadow, who's performing at the Brixton Academy this evening. So he's very good at DJing. Plays all the records that you want. Plays all the records that you want. Don't, don't, don't bring your own. He's got them all. He's got them all. I've seen him arrive. He's got two big bags of them. Yeah. So there's. There's three pairs of CJ Shadow tickets. We'll give those away later as well. Don't just start phoning arbitrarily now. We'll give those away. Lemonade. Sorry, I need some lemonade. Okay, well, while we sort out some lemonade, let's play a tune. Come on, Kodo. What's wrong? Ryan Adams, from his new album, a track called Nuclear. Yeah. Found a new way of making it more exciting when you're talking about something. I'll go, yeah, brilliant. Agreeing with you, making it all interesting. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's a really good album that. Yeah. Yeah. It's apparently just a collection of sort of demos and songs he had lying around. Oh, I wish I had that. Yeah. You know, we're giving away those DVDs until the. Forward to that. Children of the Corner. I've got an interesting anecdote about the. The office, Carl. We. We and Carl went out, right, and with me and Jane, Carl, Johnny and Gigi, wasn't it? No, wasn't. Is it important? No. Okay. But we're walking down the street. Carl was there, though, and he can back me up on this. We had a curry, we're walking back and. And this little funny homeless fellow, didn't he? Yeah. I got to tell it before I go, didn't he? Yes. He came up to me, right, and he recognized it. Talking's more difficult than you think, right? And he came to me and he went. He went, oh, he said, I've just nicked five your DVDs from HMB. And he shook my hand, he was so happy with it. And I went, right, excellent. He went, all I do is I just swing the bag over the top like that when I'm going out. And he had a bag full of DVDs, didn't he? And he was. He was so pleased to tell me that he'd stolen that. Great. He said that. He said, they're going like hotcakes. I know. We get paid for them, though, don't we? So we, not the stolen ones. Don't we? No. What do you mean? Did you sign them for him, you idiot? So he just nicked five? Yeah. You say he was homeless, Was he? Well, don't know, maybe. No, surely. How would he have seen the show? He just walked past Curry's one morning. Yeah. Seen a trainer for it, thought, interesting. I don't know if he was homeless. I didn't go into his home life. He shook his hand, though, and. But he made Carl look smart, do you know what I mean? So. But he wasn't northern, was he? No, he was like, do you know in the Fast show with Paul Whitehouse when he did that character, that shady character. Yes. The spit of that, you know, ponytail T shirt on a bit too big for him and just the movement and everything, really. Like a, you know, a cockney little cheeky chat type person. A little cockney cheeky ch. And yeah, he just said, oh, it's. You said, yeah. You got your DVDs, got six of them from HMV going like hot cakes. They are. And then if he went whistling. Yeah, well, chuffed with himself. Yeah. Going like hotcakes. What's he gonna do with them? They'd probably sell them. How does he sell them? Where does he sell them? Does he go to people go, do you want an office dvd? They're not nicked. Four quid. Yeah, exactly. At least stolen. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. They've still got the tags on them. Well, it's like those people who, those cab drivers that you'll meet, it's at three in the morning. Who just got a car. Yeah. Just went out with a car. Yeah. And I'll pick people up and charge them. I got in one once. I said to him, the guy just pulled up, I said, he said, I was in like East London. I go back to North London. I said, yeah, going to Swiss Cot. We set off. He went, do you know the way? I said, well, not really, no. I thought. I thought you'd know the way. You're in a cabion. He went, no, don't really know the way there. I said, have you got an A to Z? He went, no. I thought, well, if you're going to go out just on the, you know, just winging it as a cab driver, two things. Take a map and a torch. He didn't have either. He said, well, I'll probably get to Camden. I said, well, I'll direct you from there. Drove on for about five minutes, making conversation. In fact, five minutes later went, do you know the way to Camden. I thought you knew the way to Camden. I don't really know the way I thought I did. Oh, let me out. Four quid. Exactly. And that's. I can't. I don't know who's got that sort of time on their hands that they just think it's three in the morning, I'm at a loose end. I think I'll go out doing a bit of cabbing. Wow. Because your dad was a cabbie, wasn't it? Yeah, he was, yeah. Couldn't stand it. But it's good money. He was a professor. He wasn't like a Chancellor, though. What was he. What was he doing when he put that little forest gump in a. In a weedy bin? That was. That was part of the cab company thing. They had to do like a charity event once a year and he did it one year. Never asked him again. Tells the story again. I'd rather not because we got a few sort of complaints about it. Why? Why do you get complaints about it? Because it's. Because he put a kid in a bin and it's not the thing to do. But we could use it as a sort of sobering lesson for people. Yeah. Tell it like it. Tell it like a. You know, don't. You shouldn't do it. Nice. Yeah. But that's how I did it last time. But people still didn't like it. All the stuff I tell you, I don't. You know, we don't take the mickey out of people on purpose. It's real life, innit? And that goes on in life. Yeah, I was saying that in Little Load, you know, I was in hospital. Yeah. You know, he did some jokes about old people and that, and he said, at the end of the day, if something makes you laugh, it's funny. And if it makes you laugh, you can't help laughing, can you? So what you meant to do. Laughing's good for you. Yeah. So that isn't as good for you, is it? No, but there's probably more people laughing at one person. So if you balance it out, there's only one person who's upset and there's a bunch of people laughing. So it's. Give me an example of that. Give me an example. For instance, Carl Pilkington, as he talks and the people listening. Yeah. Yeah. They're giving you an example of, like. So, you know. Well, I can't, because again, that's what I'm saying. I can't tell you the story because there might be someone out there who this Person might even be listening and think, I forgot about that. And you brought it all back to me. Yeah. So I prefer to leave it, but I think people know. Why did he put him in the bin in the first place? Because he was getting out of hand. What was he doing, though? You see, I can't explain. You can. That'd be silly. I prefer to. To leave it, honestly. What was he doing? Was he annoying him? He was annoying me dad and the other people in the cab. Right. And he thought, how can I deal with this before it gets too out of hand? Yeah. He pulled over and put the lad in a wheelie bin. I'm gonna bear. So we'll leave that and then. Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. How old was the kid? Not sure. But I mean, it was a trip to sort of Blackpool, so I'm guessing. Do you think it was one of the rides? 17. This is rubbish. 17, yeah. Oh, he's quite an old lad, then. So a big lad. Yeah. But let's. Let's. Did he pick him up? He picked him up and put him in a wheelie bin. Every time he says it. And then on the way back, he got him back again. He said, right, you won't do that. Again on the way back. Yeah. He left him there for a bit. He left him there. What, they went to Blackpool and he left the kid in the wheelie bin? Yeah. Did he? Yeah. What was the kid in the wheelie bin when he drove back? Yeah. Did he not get out? No, because how do you get out? It's tricky, isn't it? And he wasn't a normal kid, was he? Let's. Let's leave it. He wasn't a normal kid. Right. All right, then. So is your father in prison? I think he should be, yeah. Go on, then. Feeder. Come back around. Xfm 104.9 Ricky's Ray. Steve Merchant. Carl Pilkerton. I asked Carl in the week, right? What animal would he never trust, even if he got to know it and it was a pet and everything, what animal would he never trust? What was it? Was this a wasp? Yeah. Why wouldn't you trust a wasp, Carl? I just think that Shifty, all. All other animals, if you get them at an early age, you can sort of make them like you, you can train them. A wasp? Never. Is there anything you do think there's anything you could do that would kind of win the favor and win the trust of a wasp? What would you have to do, do you think? Well, if you had it from a little grub. Yeah. And you fed it? Yeah, it's playing with marmalade. It doesn't affect it though, does it? A bee dies, doesn't it, if it does it. So it's not going to like use it willy nilly. That's easy for you to say. What, a wasp. You think they sting arbitrarily? They just sting for the fun of it. They're like sort of like delinquent insects. I think so. Because last night, right. I mean, this is part of educating Ricky in a way. But something I learned last night was that tarantulas only bite you if you annoy it. Right? They don't. They don't. Do you know how people say, oh, if you're in a sleeping bag living in a jungle, a spider will get in there and it'll bite you? Apparently not. You've got to really annoy it. The thing that it really hates is having its leg sort of twisted. It hates having his leg twisted. Right, but that's more for. Is that what they said in a documentary? Almost certainly not. Steve almost said, were you watching the documentary? No, no, I was reading it. Oh, you're reading it. And it was this because it scrawled on the wall. Seemed like a public toilet. I'll tell you more about that later. So if you don't trust the evil wasp, what animal do you trust? What's your favorite? Well, I also, right, supposing your mind, right, was put your mind put into any animal and you've got to get from where you are now, right, to Glasgow as an animal, right, but the authorities will be looking out for it, okay. And it's shooting you, right, and what, you went through loads, didn't you? I was thinking about it for. It must have took me about an hour. So your mind, sorry, your mind has been put into an animal anyway, so. It'S you in this animal thinking you've got to get to somewhere, yeah? Maybe your body is in Glasgow. So. And you've got to get this animal to get to you so it can transfer its mind back into your body. But the government knows that we've all had that con. So the government's going, carl, can't have your own brain back. I only have it with Carl. We don't like these conversations. Go on. Yeah, so, yeah, so you're on the way. So think about it. You think about it just for a second. So let's recap. Your. Your body's in Scotland, right? He's the only one that takes my question seriously. Your. Your brain is in London, right? And there's like loads of security and stuff. Looking out in the sky for animals or looking on. On the field, seeing what's looking a bit suspicious, trying to get to your body. And they're shooting and they're shooting, killing all the animals. What thing would you pick to get your brain to Scotland that wouldn't get caught? And I reckon that I. I've got the answer. A wasp. No, because think about. A lot of people get irritated if it sort of wanted to get a lift in a car going down the motorway, if someone's driving, wasp in the car. It's a nightmare. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Cause a right accident. So think of something that people wouldn't. You know, and the clock's ticking as well. You're taking this really very seriously. You've only got a couple of thought. You've given this a lot of thought, haven't you? You have, yeah. So something with speed. Yeah. Something that can travel quite speedily and something that's also inconspicuous. Yeah, yeah. Is that the sort of thing you're. That's what you're going. And is it. Is it a creature that's. That's native to this country? Yeah, right. Yeah, it is. I've got no idea, Carl, what you think. Tell him. A flea. A flea. Tell him. Why. Think about it. Right? This flea, it's got my brain. It's dead small, the flea. Thanks for clearing that up. Yeah. And it's. It. So it goes, right, I've got to get to Scotland. So it jumps on someone who's going to Euston Station. They don't know it's there. No. The government can't see it. Come on. That's it, Steve, think of that statement. Think of it. Just tuned in. Yeah. Now, people get on the train, go to Glasgow or Edinburgh, wherever in Scotland it is. It jumps off, it goes, right. Jumps on someone else who's going the way it needs to go. Gets there. Still no one's seen. It jumps on me. I get me brain back. Yeah. Government are like, but. And you feel confident that your brain would fit in that of a fleas. Well, you said there was no problem with the size of it. You said you could. That certainly wouldn't be so. No, pretty much. You could download everything, you know, into a flea. That's genius. Yeah, that's. What would you rather have, right? Roller skate feet and there's little wheels. Right. Chopstick hands. Yeah, Instead of hands. Chopsticks, hands, wheels instead of feet. Yeah. Right. Or acne. How big are the Wheels. Can I take you guys back to the old school? Do you mind if we take them? Take it back to the old school? Yeah. What are you gonna do? What are you gonna lay on me? No, I just. Maybe a bit of a dead on solo. Yeah. Is it wrong going back to the old school? As long as. As long as it's vinyl. It is indeed. Slam it on. De La Soul. Old school. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. Jam name Saturday. Brilliant. Yeah, good stuff, Carl. So, Educating Ricky, you were going to tease us now with some of the big headlines. He really is dancing there. Right, right. So, okay, the way this works is. What would you rather be, Carl? I teach you superheroes three things. A frog boy. Yeah, you could leap. You could leap onto a house, but you had to go before you had to go first and leap onto a house. You're, you know, this frog boy. And that could be useful, couldn't it? That's very useful, yeah. Right. Amploid, where you've got your. Your hands and microphones and you can talk into your hand and your whole body. It's like 100 decibels. You can go, oi, come here. And people hear you from miles away. Amploid. Right, right. Or. Or sado. Right. And that means that you can go up to anyone and go, all right. And that's just. They don't know why. They just get fed up for the whole day. Which of those would you prefer? Don't answer. Now think about it. The frog thing. Do I look like one or. No, you're just you and your little Ben Sherman shirt and everything. And they go. And people walk along and they go, o at that young child from on that roof. He's going to fall. Which frog boy was there? And you go. And you go down, you go. And they go, is him. They don't recognize you when you're squatting. They go, I don't know who you are. And you leap up there save. And you come back and they go, where's frog boy? And you're standing up and you go, don't know. He went that way. Yeah, I'll probably have that one. Okay. Okay, go on. Right, so did that just go out? I got a bad. Hey, look, Rick, Carl's really planned this show. He's really worked out. He came in early, he was writing. Things down and there's just coming up. With rubbish and you're just talking rubbish. So, Carl, I know you've been thinking this through. What have you got? So Educating Ricky, we did it last week. It's where I teach you some Stuff. But rather than just teach you something, a teaser. So you want to know more, so you want to take in information. Right. So if only people have taught you like that. So. And also, it's the name of a film, sort of. Yeah. Nearly coming up soon. Henry VII is. Well, how many wives come back tomorrow, Carl, to find out. The little. The little headlines. I've got to sort of tease you with the story. Yeah. This is gonna hurt me and I'm not very well. Go on. Right, we've got. So. So this is what. Sorry, I've got. I've just got lost for a minute there. This is Educating Ricky. Yeah. And these are the stories that you're. These are the things you're going to tell him. Yeah, but these are just headline versions. These are headlines. If it's not the actual fact, then I think people will remember things. Bullet points. Who can forget Hairy Chinese boy? Indeed. I shall never forget that. Yeah. So first headline. Don't do that to it. You know it. Can't live without an ad. I've got no idea. It could be about the French Revolution. It could be about anything. I know it is. No, you think you do, but. No, no, it's something I taught you. Is it? Is it the fact that cockroaches can live for nine days without a head? That's part of it, but it's something different as well. Okay. Okay, brilliant. So next one. Do you want to work it out? If only it was raining. Brilliant. Okay, and the last one. What's tomato with you? What's tomato with you? Look how pleased he is. You're obsessed with puns, aren't you? At the moment. Kay. It just works. I think it works. Yeah, we love puns. So cool. There you go. So which of those are you going to choose? Right. Oh, well, I'm going to have to choose. Don't do that. You know it. Can't live without it, can we play. A tune and we'll come back with that? Find out what that is. Yeah. Wow. What a history lesson. That's going to be. Dandy Warhols and bohemian like you. On XFM 104.9, I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl, what's the story then? Right, so what did you say you're going for? You've got your three titles, your three teasers. Well, I think I'm gonna go for. Don't do that to it. You know it. Can't live for that, Ned. I'm looking forward to this. Right. Right, so this is Educating Ricky for those that just tuned in. Now, something that Ricky told me about when he was educating me was that a cockroach, if you cut its head off, it lives for a week. Yeah. Right. And the only reason it dies is it can't take on water. Sure. It doesn't have a great time in that week though, does it? I mean, it doesn't. Not much done. I don't know, it just. It just needs water because it can't find any. Its eyes. It eventually dies. Yeah. Right. So. So no, it's not. That's not. Anyway, can't drink anyway, so with. Have you heard that one about worms? Okay. I have gone. If you cut a worm in half, a lot of people have said in the past that it'll turn into two worms. Right. But that isn't actually true. Okay. Who said that? No. So it used to be like, you know. Yeah. Kids at school and stuff. Yeah. So that, you know, a lot of people think that. Don't pick him up on stuff, Steve. It's bad. Sure. So, but what they can do, if you get a worm, right, and you find out which end its head's at. Right. If you sort of. You've got its head there at the left hand side. Right. And if you sort of cut it in half. Right. But not enough so there's more of its neck than the tail, if you know what I mean. Yeah. The bit that you've cut off will sort of die and the rest of the worm will get better. So in a way you can cut it in half and it'll survive, but only one half will survive. Okay. Yeah. What have you learned? I wish you hadn't chosen that one. Because it's not. There's nothing, is it? How to tell a worm, Ed from its own. You put. Put it in a bowl of flour and wait till it farts. Yes. Right. I told my mate that I. And he went, what if it coughs? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it is. There is a bit of truth in. In that myth of cutting one in half. Where did you get this information? I don't understand where you get this information. It was from the Photian Times. It was like the myth, the myth about worms, the big. That was the big arc of that week. Did it take you as long to read that article as it took you to tell us just then? I like the fact that it starts off debunking a myth that we have no doubt of. Anyway, you know the big thing about cutting a worm in half, making two worms no. Yeah. What's the other one? It's not the thing to do either, by the way. Don't. Don't go doing it. No, it's not very nice, but it's cool. It can get by and it's pointless. Yeah. There's no scientific worth. Yeah. In that. Well, there you go. Okay, then. So the others. Now you see what I do. No, I tell you, the other titles. You're not having them yet. That's. That's the whole idea of this. People will be driving or about to go out doing the shopping. They'll think about that. Now, what was the other two? Well, the other two. They won't think about that. They've forgotten that. No, they will. No, they've forgotten that already. If only it was raining. And what's tomato with you? I'm looking forward to that one. You've got a town. Look. Look what's happening. You see, you already want more education and this is what listeners will be doing. I tell you, I wish you were a teacher. I so wish you were a teacher. Do you know what I mean? Kids would be saying, I know it's half past three, but I don't want to go home. I want more. Yeah. And that's. That's what I'm doing with you. I'm teaching you. Why are you teaching information? Why teaching me things about not to cut worms in half? And what's tomato with you? Please tell me what's tomato with you, Karl? In a bit. In a clip. No, in a bit, Rick. I'd say he's thought the show through. He's teasing the audience. You're excited they're listening. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. So listen, I think we should all. Because we've got your competition to squeeze and we've got all these great good goodies. Let's not forget. Hello, Children of the Corn. I do feel slightly, though. Now, this is Carl Peopleton Show. I don't think we should have our names involved. It's not fair, is it? And I think we should give Carl the money. I don't want my name to this. It's a Ricky Gervais show. Yeah, right, the quiz. Yeah, well, we get out of the way because they've only got an hour to start. Don't you worry about that, Carl. I've already got this one thinking. I'm thinking on your terms. Now, let's play a tune. We'll come back with the big competition information. All right, Money Mark. We got a classic from Money Mark from his album. Push the Button. Play that Car. And afterwards. Are we excited you got the competition? Look at his face. He's so excited now. He's thought this through. He's loving it. Rockbusters. Rock Busters. Yeah. Agreed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Should we do that? Yeah, brilliant. Go on. You're rejuvenated, are you? Yeah. Let's take an hour. Yeah, yeah. Hangover. Finish with. Yeah, it's all done. Done, done. Add some water. Excellent. That'll often sort it out. Yeah. Flea is the best way. He just had an argument with a punter. Someone called up and said, I don't think a flea is very good. How would the flea know? Tell him. Tell him what he said. He said, how would the flea know what train to get on? He went, he gets used. And then look at the timetable. Yeah. And he went. He went, we're not going to agree on this. He got annoyed at him because the bloke said the bit. Better to be a wasp. A wasp would not survive, would it, on, you know, a virgin train or something? So why. Why wouldn't it? It just wouldn't. Because people really don't like wasps. So somebody would end up clouting it and killing it and that brain would never get to his body. So, right, here it is, quiz time. This is the moment we've all been looking forward to. Oh. Do you want to tease them with the prizes? No, not really, because they might not bother phoning in. It's not a phone. Or is it? It's email. All right. Okay. Well, a quick reminder then. We got to the office. I don't want people to think that we'll just keep plugging the office dvd. We've got nothing else to give away. No, no one gives anything away. No one's hanging around in Carl's little room. Did you get a guy from HMV just to get a guy? Just nick these from HMV. What's that story? So we got the Officer DVD, obviously. We got the Remix XFM's remix album, Volume 2. That's sort of remixes of various tunes. Quite a good little compilation album here. One of those kind of, of the best Coldplay, Travis, Oasis, blah, blah, blah, blah albums in the world ever and. Exactly. Have a look on this. Morissette 9 catatonia. I just count. Isn't that. But the big one, the big star prize that you're all playing for is, of course, the DVD widescreen version of Children of the Corn, Stephen King's horror film, Lest we forget. It's got Peter Horton as the star, so. So look forward to that. We're gonna give Shadow away separately, are we? We're gonna do that separately? Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll give away the DJ Shadow tickets at a separate. Right, so we're playing for those DVDs and CDs and what? Yeah, the phone lines are lighting up a bit. So put the phone down, get the computer started up. Yeah, and it's ricky.gervaisxfn.co.uk if you know the answers to these, right? And the way it works, we did it last week, but if you didn't hear it, I'll give you some initials and like a bit of a cryptic clue. So. And you work out who the band is or the artists, right? It's always, it's always a band or an artist. It's not any TV programs and that. So say, like last week we had. We had S, didn't we? And it was better than the average homeless person. And that was super Trump. Right, so it's not always XFM music. It can be anything. And there's three of them. They've got to get all three of them. You've got to get all three. I know how long this intro so far. Yeah, but, but, but. Here we go then, right, first, initials lr. Lr. Lr. Okay. Yeah. And the cryptic clue is. You should have thought it through. You should have thought it out before you came in. Yeah, Cryptic claim you've got it. Yeah, I'll take that book to the toilet with me. I'll take that book to the toilet with me. Yeah, yeah. Lr, lr. I'll take that book to the toilet with me. And don't shout out if you know the unseckers. No. No idea. Car. No idea. Right, okay, so there's one, right? The second one. Fl. This one's actually been emailed in as a suggestion. Okay? That person who's done that, don't email in because you're disqualified from the comp. So I'd love him to be a teacher. So it'd be great, wouldn't it, just to see it one day. Can't we do that? Can't we get you a placement somewhere for you to teach history to sort of like, you know, 14 year olds? I think science, Rick. Science would be good. Yeah. I'll tell you what, you got a lot of. Just quickly for me, Carl, explain. Say what can we get him to explain that? Everyone learns as a kid. Science, photosynthesis. So fl. Right? FL are the letters and the cryptic clue. Blow the candles out before you eat the cake. Blow the candles out before you eat the cake. Yeah, blow the candles out before you eat the cake. The letters there. Flowers. All right, we've got lr, we got fl. Yeah. And finally the third one, ns. Hold on. How many have they gotta get? Three. Don't worry, there's no more after this. Right. Ns how can I wash up in something shaped like that? Right, that's one of mine. So very quickly recap, just in case I missed any. LR is the first one. Lr. I'll take that book to the toilet with me. Cryptic clue. And we had fl. Blow the candles out before you eat the cake. And the final one, ns. How can I wash up in something shaped like that? If you think you know the bands, you just email in. Ricky.gervaisr film.co.uk you win the DVDs, the CDs, and that's it. He's great. I could just. I could sit here and watch him all day do this. What I. So, ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk and we'll give the. Answers out just before, you know, we finish, because. Okay, then we'll keep them locked. All right. Oh, just briefly, this is module four, A. Natural history. Yeah, Just. Just briefly explain evolution since, you know, natural selection, Origin of the species, Darwin. Just briefly describe. That's the monkey thing, isn't it? Oh, well done, Carl. What would you have fancy playing, Rick? I know you're always keen to rejuvenate the reputations of certain artists when you think maybe they've been kind of unfairly treated in the history of rock and roll. Yeah. I'll tell you, a band, I've always thought it was being treated badly. Yeah. The Lemonheads. You with me? Yeah, yeah. Imaginary friend. Lemon Heads. If I could talk, I'd tell you, yeah, he wrote some good little tunes before he went a bit potty. What would you rather have? Right, Carl, would you rather have a lemon for a head, a radio for a head? What other band is there with something head? Radiohead. Oh, you've done that. Yeah. Or a talking head. Right. Third one. No, but you don't know what. No, because you've got you and then you've got someone else's head on top and it doesn't shut up. It's my head. It's my talking head. Coming out of your head. Yeah. So a radio head. Just a Radiohead, and you can tune in. Right. You know, you said there, Carl, that wasps were one of the most irritating things on the planet. Can I offer another suggestion? Yeah. You with me on that? Educating Ricky. We got. We got. We got two left, don't we? I'm looking forward to this. We've got two more. We've still got. If Only It Was Raining. And what's tomato with you? I tell you what, I wish the listeners could see how happy he was when we started getting emails coming in. Oh, yeah, people. They're flooding in, actually. Yeah. And he's so happy, he started dancing along going, well, that proves it's a good competition, he said. There's loads of people emailing there. Yeah. And I'll tell you. I'll tell you what it is. It's not the competition. It's this Children of the Corn, White screen. Next week, some staples and pencils, a piece of carpet. Tell you. All right, well, now we've got them and they're staying. Something we. We've still got to do. Yeah. Is he is running the show now? He's doing well, isn't he? Because I've done nothing. I've done nothing towards this. I'm coming out my hangover a little bit, if you're worried. So go on. Remember last week we started a new feature called that Song's Got a Good Story in it and brilliant. I love your catchy titles, they're excellent. Right. And the idea was it was a story in a song, which meant that if it was played on the radio, you couldn't just, like, fade it out because you've got to have the full story. Yeah. Right. Well, last week we started the feature with Stevie Wonder Living for the City. Yeah. Right. But you played the version where it fades out. Yeah. I didn't know there was more to it. So Steve told me what album it was on. Yeah, I've gone and got it. We've got the second half to that story. Yeah. Yeah. This week. Yeah. So you've got half the story. What was it? What had happened is like, the lads living in Mississippi. There's not much going on there. Mississippi, that's someone off Rainbow's mum living. What, Mississippi? Yeah. His dad's was his. His man was a cleaner. Yeah. Trying to get by. They didn't have a great life, but they still looked after the kids and stuff. There's more to it than that. Have you got it ready? There's more to it than that. I should hope so. We'll probably do it about half past. So look forward to that. The second half of Stevie Wonders Living for the City a week later. I love a show that's carefully planned. So, listen, this isn't a show. This isn't a show. This isn't a radio show. This is. I don't know what this is. I don't know what it is. We might as well start banging tambourines. It's ridiculous. This is rubbish. Right, but wa. Some people emailed in, put him in a wheelie bin, went to Blackpool, right? Some people emailed in the stories, songs with stories in. One of them was Babushka. And he went, what's that? And I went, ask Kate. What is it? I said, oh, it's about a woman who dresses up as another woman to introduce her husband. He went, they wouldn't work. Just dismissed it like that. Why do you think it would work? Because you. You'd know. I mean, say, like. Say like, right, Suzanne, right, Who I go out with, yeah, she can see me from, say, if I'm coming down the high street seat, yeah? She knows it's me by the way I walk, right, so just the fact that this woman went and put a wig on. You haven't even heard the song. I know, but you're saying that she put a disguise on and he's like, oh, a fancy year. And he takes her out and he doesn't know it's his missus. You're not buying it. I mean, I'm. I'm controlling this. Where is the flea? Whereas the flea with your brain going to Glasgow. Perfect sense. Yeah. Babushka. Rubbish. Carl, can we have the tomato story after the next tune? Yeah, yeah. Bit of Coldplay. Yeah, Love it. Yeah, Coldplay. The Scientist on XFM. 104.9. Right. Competition, is it? No, it's Educating Ricky Part 2. Oh, is it? Yep. I wasn't even listening. He's doing all the work. I wasn't even listening. Oh, they spilled some water down that. Right, what's this one again, then? Right, what's the teaser headline? Teaser headline is what's tomato with you? Brilliant. Yeah. How excited were you when you came up with that? You couldn't wait to come in and tell us, could you? I just. I think it's a good one because you won't forget it now, will you? I mean, like the worm one. What's so special about the worm? You know, a lot of people think that if you cut a worm in half, it will. Two worms will grow. But no, what happens is, if you cut the head end slightly nearer the tail than the head, the tail will die, but the worm with the head will be okay. So it's exploded a myth and taught me something. Right. So the second one, Part two of Educating Ricky. What's tomato with you? What this one's about is ages ago. Scientific. There's never a date, there's never a country. Okay, settle down, children. Now, this is a level history, right? Once upon a time. Yeah, yeah. In a. When a mental place. With swords was a king. Forget his name, but he was a loony. So. And it was literally ages ago. So good luck in the exam. Yeah, so, like, you know. All right. Many years ago. Oh, yes, yeah. Cleared that up. They thought tomatoes were poisonous. Okay, because. What. Hold on. Are they going to be proved wrong at the end of this story? Well, because I don't want to give away the ending, but is it something to do with the. Are they poisonous tomatoes? No. Oh, you haven't. I don't believe it. They could have been eating tomatoes all this time. Oh, Steve, what's the matter with you? Anyway, okay, so let's just recap quickly. Recap quickly. Many years ago, when people thought tomatoes were poisonous. They didn't know they were poisonous then because they were still eating them. But what was happening. But they're not poisonous. This. Ah, but hang on a minute. All right, it's not. I'm just going to listen, I'm not even going to. Okay, I'm not going to tackle. So if you remember years ago, they didn't have, like, pottery plates. They had. They had lead plates, right? What are you talking. Sorry, what year is this? Plates made out of lead. And what they'd end up doing, they. They'd say, right, you want a tomato? And they go, yeah, all right. And they put the tomato on the lead plate and cut it. And because of the acid in the tomato, right, it would sort of. Sort of make the lead runny and the lead would go into the tomato. And they say, oh, it's love this. And they'd be eating it. They'd get food poisoning, lead poisoning, what have you, and they'd be really ill. So they thought tomatoes were poisonous, so they didn't eat them for many years. And when you say they, do you mean the people of Narnia? Yeah. This did not. Where was this? Sort of in. In Britain. You put him on the spot there. Oh, I hope there's no uppity pupils at this school when they go, what do you mean, sir? Oh, if you're gonna. I'm fed up with you. Do you understand? No. So. So the. The answer. No, no, no, you've got no. No. Right, right. Okay, first of all, Carl, where'd you get this? Information from 14 times as well. Do you know? You can't remember. I don't know where I got that from. I don't know where I got it from. But. But I don't. Why don't you think that makes sense? But. But what? Someone once got lead poisoning from a tomato. Not just one loads. And then all of a sudden. Why is this educating me? Because I'm telling you that tomatoes. I can't take anything away from this. I don't know what to take away from this. What have I learned? What have I learned? Don't mix leg with tomatoes. Why is this educational in any shape or form? What are you talking. What are you telling me? A long time ago in the land of glunk, right, where the ninnies did slip, right, they thought tomatoes were poisonous because they ate plates of lead. What are you talking about? We all know tomatoes aren't poisonous. Is that the moral of the story? Don't believe these people that I'd never heard of before. What are you talking about, Carl? I just. I think it's a bit weird. It's a bit weird? Yeah. He's the same people that were spreading those malicious worm rumors. My hangover's coming back. I gotta get some water. Play a record. That was rubbish. I'm eating. Hey, I'm eating. So am I. Carl, you have to come. Right, yeah, we're all eating. So last week, yeah, you were playing your feature, that song I shouldn't switch off because I'm enjoying the story. And we played Living for the City, only you played the single mix, which doesn't have the entire second act, if you will. So Carl, you've not heard it before. You're excited before. You're excited to hear the second act because as far as you're aware, there was a young guy, he's living with his family. They're fairly impoverished in Mississippi, but you know, they're happy. They're getting on alright. But you're not even aware that he's moving to the big city now. It just fades out. Well, that's the city then. Question. I mean, I've liked this song for must be, you know, three or four years. And I've always listened to the single version. I had no idea that I didn't know the full story. So. Yeah, it's not. I mean, I mean, I know you. Your. Your attention to detail. You like to know the full story, like where everything. Well, the whole idea of the features to say there, you know, you've got. To listen to plate thing where Was the lead plate thing. Where was the lead plate thing? That was like, a few. Few years back. Where was it? And Scotland. Yeah, it was a problem all over the world. They had to deal with it. You're making it up now. Is it something you saw in Lord of the Rings? Yeah. Right. So anyway. Yeah, yeah. So lion and the Witch. Yeah, go on, go on. So far, then, what. What do we. What did we learn in this story? We learned so far from Stevie that there's a young lad. He's. As I say, he's got a family. He's fairly happy, except they're very poor and they struggle to get by, but they're happy. They're. Anyway, he's moving to the big city. Carl, this is the bit you didn't realize. Just play the track. Okay, here we go. So this is halfway through. This is halfway through the tune. Now this is. You not heard this before, have you? That's okay. We accidentally played an episode of Kojak by mistake. We were going to play a song. Carl. What did he make of that then? Yeah. What's happening there, then? Hey. He was living with his family, was fairly impoverished. He was almost it. Right, so. So what's your take on it, Carl, after hearing that? What I've worked out by it, the first part that we heard last week, everything's all right, but it's not that great living in Mississippi, right? So he goes, oh, I'm gonna go to New York. There's plenty of work there. They'll. They'll sort of accept me as, you know, and everything. So he goes there, and the weird thing is he's hardly, like, been in New York for a second. He gets on a bus. All of a sudden, some copper's arresting him. He's like, what's going on? And then he's got 10 years. I mean, didn't. What? You can't hear because the levels are quite bad. I mean, I work with sound. I can't really hear what's going on. You're criticizing Stevie, Wondering. I'm guessing that he didn't pay his bus fare or something, and he got. 10 years for that. I really don't know what was going on. Right, but you're not happy because obviously it's quite dangerous. Do you think Stevie Wonder left out some vital ingredients in the story, in your. In your education? Like where it was? Or at least he got where it was. You can tell what year it is. It's right in the mid-70s there. That funky. That funky New York 70s sound. Yeah, you're pretty disappointed, aren't you? You're pretty worried because what went on? Yeah, you know. Well, you know, you're aware, Carl, that that. Because that shows quite a bad image of New York. It's quite an intolerant city by all accounts. There. He arrested a guy, but it is seemingly for being black. That's. That's one song away from not in New York. Killing a Georgie. Rod Stewart, it. That lad, he was doing all right in Scotland and said, I'm going to go to the big city. He got done in. It seems to me it's that don't go there if you've. If you've got, like, problems, don't think New York's the answer, Right? Oh, hold on, hold on. So what you're saying that if you. If you're a bit fed up with your life, but you got, you know, you live with your mum and she's like, really nice, and you got friends and life's not that bad. Don't, don't. Don't go and have. Don't go and be murdered or what? What are you saying? Don't go and be murdered. Leave home, but don't go to New York, right? There's other places. Where would you go? Sheffield? Don't know, but. Yeah, but you, You're a little. You're a little mank lad, weren't you? You're in your garden, we had your train set, your brother blew up, there was a horse next door and you thought, ah, I want to go to London. So. Do you know what I mean? You've sort. You're, you're, you're like that. Yeah, but you're in many ways like the fella in that song. And like. And like Georgie. No, because in many ways you are a bit like Georgie, aren't you? I had a car, so. No. Are you a little bit like Georgie in many ways? I didn't get on a bus, I had a car, so I wasn't gonna have the problem he had for a start. Right? But I mean this. I suppose there's loads of things you can look at that story and take out of it. That's what I like about the feature, Right? What, so tell us what you like about the feature. Yeah, the feature that we're doing. All right, The. That song's got a good story. If you had a time machine, where would you go? What year would you go? Would you. Probably the 60s. Okay. Would you go forward at all? What's your favorite year in the future? No, I don't. I. I Don't know. If someone could tell your future to you, you wouldn't want to know straight away. You knew. There was no hesitation. Yeah. You've thought about this, haven't you? No. You've thought to yourself, if someone can reveal my future, Carl, you're not doing that. You've got to do one of these things, right? You know, he's not, you know, like Quantum Leap. Like a fellow in Quantum Leap. What's his name? I forget his name, but yeah, yeah. And you've got a little fellow with Hal and he's telling you, right, would you rather go back and you go in someone's body? Would you rather go back? You could go back to be a donkey. Donkey that's carrying Mary to Wesleyan. You could be a saigon prostitute in 1975. All those GIs queuing up. Think about it. Or you could be Moby Dick. Which of those would you be, Carl? Think about it. Probably Moby Dick's the best option. Okay, what work will we got after this? We need to educate Ricky for the final time. Final time. Educating Ricky. We've still got to give away these tickets to DJ Shadow. And we've got to give the answers to your magnificent. We've only got. It's not enough time in this show. It's packed. Brace for the prize from the Flaming Lips competition. Answer time. Is it coming? Yeah, we did. We did this, like, about an hour ago. Rockbusters. Rockbusters with Carl Bilkington. Yeah, I gave you some initials. The initials sort of made up a band. We had lr. We had ns. Yeah. Right. So lr. The clue was, I'll take that book to the toilet with me. The answer. Lou Reed. Lou Reed. Good. That's very good. That's very good. Okay, next one, Florida. Blow the candles out before you eat the cake. Yeah, we just play them. Flaming Lips. There we are. Okay. And the final one was ns. How can I wash up in something shaped like this? Yeah, that was NSync. Yeah, NSync. It'd be a bit N sink. If you had a sink. You wash up in a sink? Yeah. Shaped like an N. You'd be like, oh, I've got everything out. Has anyone got that? Wow. Right, well, there are right answers. I have to say, Carl, you've done very well. It was an enormous response. I'm just gonna click on one of these emails randomly. I'm not even gonna look who we got here. We've got. Kath Turner is the winner. Kath Turner gets those great DVDs and. Watching children of the Corn tonight. Children of the Corns. She was going out. I imagine she's gonna catch. She's gonna phone a few friends and say, I can't come out, I'm ill. They go, you're not. You're not watching Children of the Corn. I go, no, no, no, no. And we've learned as well that there are about five other sequels to Children of the Corns. So may, what else have we got to do? Have we got anything else to do? Quick, Carl, what would you rather be, a tree frog or a tree crab? Quick, what would you rather be, straight away? Tree frog or a tree crab? Tree frog. Why? Don't know what one is. You just said, pick one. Quick. A tree frog or a tree crab? Would you rather be a tree frog? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, what would you rather be, a tick or a leech? They both suck blood. There's not a lot in it. Go on. Why? Because I heard they've got. I was reading about them yesterday. They've got 300 teeth. And what they do is, if they get on you, right, and you didn't get it off with a match or anything, it would stay there. And it eats five times the amount of blood to make it five times bigger than the size of itself. You're a scientist. And then it'll just go, I've had enough. And it falls off. Okay. Naturally. What would you rather be, a puppy or kitten? Kitten. Why? Just look better. Okay. Yeah. The music of Tomorrow is here. XFM. Some great adverts there.9. Absolutely. We have to give away these three pair. We have to give these away, Rick. Yeah, yeah. We got three pairs of details. Jam packed. I think we've planned too much for this next week. I think we have a little bit flabbier next week. Do less, do less. Rick, can we chill out next week, please? Yeah, go on then. So, yeah, we. Any ideas, guys? Any questions? Sort of DJ shadow related questions. Any shadow or DJ questions? Carl, any ideas? What does the word DJ mean? I'll tell you something I do know. Go on. Right. But I can't really get a question out of it. Go on, just tell us. There's a shadow somewhere. It's already good, isn't it? I know, right? There's a shadow. I think it was in America. Yeah. And it's on a quiet road, I'm guessing somewhere like Boston, that's what. Somewhere like Boston. And people at night used to see this shadow moving about and they'd go, what's that? Right. And it got known that the Town, the little local town got known for the shadow. But it didn't cause any problems. People. What are you talking about? You've lost me. What are you talking about? Do you know, like, some places get famous? Like, Scotland's got a lot less monster than that. But it doesn't cause. But it doesn't cause any problems. Right, so there's this shadow walking about on the road. See, again, rubbish. Right, so it's nonsense. Where did you read this? Where did you talk about this Was on the Internet and I'm sure. Oh, sorry, sorry. I thought it was a shite. I didn't know it was on the Internet. Right, so this shadow is moving about. And independently of an object. Yeah. And the local mayor. And that is like. Yeah, it's a bit weird, but it's not harming anyone. The mayor involved, was he elected to that post? Hey, hey, Mayor. We got a problem down here. Seems like a shadow. Wow. It's not causing anybody. No, it's just causing any problems. Yeah, but that's the thing. It was left for years and then it did start causing problems. I see. That's it. If you leave these shadows to go unchecked, Rick, they go crazy. You let them run amok in the city. Yeah. You've got to stand. What did the shadow do? It was pushing people off the bikes. It was what? It was pushing people off the bikes. I'll find out more for that next week. Right, that'll tease up. You're a maniac. We'll do more on that. We haven't had time for education. Please never have children. Right? Just promise me now you'll never have kids. Look, we haven't got time. Okay, listen, all right, DJ Shadow. Have we got time for these? To give these tickets away? Yeah, if they just call up, we'll. No, I'll tell you what, I've got a question. Right. Where do you. Where do. Does Carl think this may have taken place? If you've been listening to the show, where do you think this evil shadow has been running amok? Let us know the number, Carl. Oh, eight. 700, 800 1234. So. But that's it. We are actually out of time. We are indeed. Have I got time for a song for later? It's a bit tight. I was told to finish now. I know, but we've got to get finished early today, so. Why? Just because we have and we're wasting more time talking about why we have to. Oh, this has been pathetic. So the call. Up. Up. Where did I see the ghost and You've got to pick the tickets up from reception. You can go tonight, see DJ Shadow Shy. This is shoddy. All right, see you then.",
