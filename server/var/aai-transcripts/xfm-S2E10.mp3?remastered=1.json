Carl working hasn't. He's come up with a few games and we made him. He's getting a bit stressed when we shout him because the mics don't work or it's hanging off. It was too hot in here. He couldn't get the thing working last week. I mean, I really would throw this studio away and get a real one. Yeah, well, I'd get one of those ones you can buy for. For like tenor from Argos. Argos, yeah. Like Bon Tempe. You My first. Yeah, my first with a little picture. Of Carl on it. Yeah, exactly. That'd be great. Great product placement. What have you got this week for us, Carl? Because again, we've put very little. I said I would put. I'm not hungover, but I've put nothing in. Rick, have you done any work for this week? No. No. None whatsoever? No, no, no, no. Okay, Carl, what have you got? What have you got? Quick, keep them there. It's five past. They're turning over already. They're finding other things. There's Melon sue, there's everything. We'll go on. We've got. After the success of last week, Rockbusters. Okay, we're doing that again. Sorry, were you on the same show as us? I thought it went all right last week. Yeah, yeah. Right, so we'll be doing that. Got some nice prizes which. Oh, what prize? What films have you got? No, I'll tell you what, if it's Children of the Corn two, then can I. Can I enter this competition? What is that? He's got all different prices. Maybe I should. I should just tease the audience with those a bit later because there's some. Exciting stuff there that's gonna be amazing. Yeah. I don't want to give too much away, Rick, but one of them is copy of the Office on dvd. Is anything like maybe Burt Reynolds, straight to video film. Any of those in there? Sadly, nothing quite as classy. Fist. Yeah. Right. So we've got. We've got that lot to give away. Yeah, we've got Educating Ricky because you taught me that. People used to eat tomatoes off lead plates in the land of Narnia last week, which was good. Yeah. It's the only tomatoes they off the lead plates, by the way. Why? Why? Didn't they think other fruits and vegetables were poisonous? No, it wasn't. It was because tomatoes had acid in them. That was the problem, you see, you don't. Don't listen. Right, well, lots of fruits have acid in them. Yeah, but they didn't eat them back then. They didn't have bloody kiwi fruit and stuff. Bloody. You're a producer. I'll start saying shit and. And stuff. You start saying bloody tits. Player. Play the hang up. Right. And. Go on. Keep him hooked. Right. Yeah. We've still got a song with a story in it. Yeah. You don't want to play Babushka, do you? He doesn't like the idea of Babushka. I told him that was a story and he doesn't like it. Devil went down to Georgia. Someone sent in, you know, he's looking for a soul to steal. Doesn't like it. Weren't you like that? Do you know the song? Not particularly. Right. It's a song about a lad who goes into a pub on a normal night. It's in sort of the deep south of America, New Orleans, you know, it's not the Old Kent Road. Right. Okay, okay, go on. He goes into a pub, There's a devil in there. He's getting a bit cocky. He's had a bit to drink and he's saying, do you want to sort of gamble your soul away with me? And we'll see who's best at playing the violin. And I think the lad wins in the end, but it's not real enough. Where's the one? Oh, what? What? Not like the shadow that got fed up and started pushing kids off bikes. Rick, I think you're referenced to stuff that no one made sense of last week. Yeah, yeah, exactly. I don't think you should refer to last week. Let's play mock turtles. Can you dig it? And then we come back and we'll talk about that. I've come to the conclusion, Rick, we should never refer to stuff Carl said in the past because it would just take too long to explain. Okay, all that's fair enough. Mock turtles. Can you dig it? What I've done there is I've taken the title and I've done it like I'm talking to someone. Xfm 104.9, Ricky Germans with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. So, Carl, how excited are you about Ricky's celebrity boxing match? Are you going to be there? Are you going to come along? Are you aware of this? You're aware of all this? Yeah, I've heard about. We can't. We can't name the opponent. Because that should be a surprise. Or the. But anyway, anyway, it's for charities. It's a charity boxing match. I always wanted to beat someone up for charity. Yeah, exactly. It's a good cause. But the thing about Ricky is, I don't know if you're aware of this, Carl, but Ricky's one of these men who. He doesn't mind sort of making a fool of himself on the telly and being funny and stuff. But if people said to him, right, you can either be Britain's funniest man, universally agree that you're the funniest man in Britain, or you could beat some gangsters up in a pub, he would go that, oh please, just let me beat people up in a pub. And maybe like an old man's being half like by some street youths and you come in and like smash some bottles over their heads and sort of sort it out. Against the odds, though. Against the odds, yeah. There's about five of them. Sure, sure. Because he's got this kind of point. Come on. Well, the point is he quite likes the idea of being sort of macho and. You know what I mean? And kind of a tough guy, you know, because he grew up in a rough boxing. Yeah. But you'd love the idea if you were going, don't mess with Ricky Gervaise. If someone said don't mess with Ricky Gervaise, that would be exciting. Never mess with Ricky Gervais, he will destroy you. That's what you'd love. Because you used to do karate, didn't you? You were a crate, you. And you got. Didn't you get up to white belt? No, I was one away from black and then I stopped because that's where I start working. Oh yeah. See, One step away from black. Really? Yeah. Okay. So anyway, I was chatting to him last night in the pub because obviously the boxing match is in about five weeks time, I think, isn't it? Yeah. And anyway, he was sat there. Carl, I don't know if you know this about Ricky, but he's taken to smoking cigars. No, I do. Are you aware of this? I had the occasional one. He got a cigar, he got like a Monte Cristo out of his pocket. It was ludicrous. He looked like George peppard for the A2. It was pathetic. And he was drinking Guinness and I was saying to him, but aren't you doing a boxing match soon? And I haven't started training yet. I'm starting training next week. You're not concerned that it's gonna. Could have an Impact. Well, I mean, what I'm saying is, you know, like the boxers that, you know, they normally put in some effort and stuff. Yeah. I mean, what. You know, getting up at 5:30. Yeah, yeah. Because you, as you reminded me of Frank Bruno when he was preparing for panto, not when he was. I don't think he even smoked then, did he? And drank. So I don't. What's your thinking, Rick? Because I'm. Because you know you're going to get your face pummeled, you know that? I mean, you're going to. They're going to destroy you. You haven't got a chance. That's why I left it this long. So I definitely lost my looks. But you haven't got a chance. You're having a laugh. Have you ever been. Have you ever. Sorry, sorry, listen, sorry. But I'm genuinely concerned. Is this sort of psychological training because. No, it's not psychological training, it's a warning. I've spoken to your friends and your loved ones and they all agree. We've got a petition going, we're sending it to the BBC. Please do not let this man box anyone else. But you're just. They're gonna beat you. Seriously. I mean, have you ever had a punt like a boxing glove in the face? No. I think you should let us punch you next week live on the show. You'd like that, wouldn't you? No, because I just. What? Because you've got to get used to it. Because I think you're gonna either cry, just start crying uncontrollably or just run away. You'll just run away. You'll just climb out the ring and run off. Yeah. This is the same tactic Ali used to get formal in rumbling the jungle. But I just. Oh, dear. Because I think a boxing glove. Because I know you're wearing like huge. Aren't you wearing like huge kind of foam box? Not. No, no, we're not. We're using. Not a normal amateur ones. Are you wearing. Are you wearing boxing gloves like those ones they used to have on gladiators? Everyone bites the dust. Those big foam gloves, you slap each other in the faces and a big sumo suit. So I should be. Okay. Do you get to. You get some kind of head protection, do you? Yeah, yeah. It's an amateur. It's amateur. So it's amateur, you say? No, I mean. So it's not. There's no title? No, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, I think that amateur is head guards, vest and 16 ounce gloves or something, as opposed to professional, which Is no vest. Bare chested. Now maybe I can ask to fight bare chested because I'd quite like to. Show off my body. Yeah. If I could. I think wrestling is really good, but I don't mean like those kind of like the rock and people like that. I'm talking about big daddy, giant headstacks. That kind of. That'd be great. You can just throw yourself at someone. Where they can sort of like be nearly dying, but then they can do a stomach butt. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Stomach to stomach. That's a good move, isn't it, in British wrestling? I always like that one. Yeah. Like. Like elephant seals fighting over a female. Is it true that you've spent. Knowing you. You spent more time deciding what tune you're going to enter the ring to? I Want to Come out to California by Tupac and Dr. Cry. I think that'd be really good. That's embarrassing. And I'm gonna come up with loads of little to make me look really big. Sure, sure. I mean, I don't know what the BBC think of that, but yeah, it might be a. Maybe we should take some suggestions as to songs that would be perhaps more appropriate. Okay. I get knocked down But I get up again A fatty bum bum yeah. Yeah, yeah Fly record. Carl. It's gonna be dissed me. It's gonna be. It's dis me next week. Take a. You take a punch in the jaw next week. Cheering Brakes long distance on XFM 104.9 on the way in. You know those little cars, they look like a little bubble car. They're modern ones. They look like half a car. Is that like a smart car? Yeah, they just look like a toy car. And you can park them sideways. There's only. Is there any room for two people? Yeah, yeah. It's just like the half the front of a Volkswagen just cut in half. Right. And I saw one going Oxford Street. And it's a police car, a real police car. Right. Yeah. And I mean, I thought, what. What happens if they have to chase someone? They couldn't. But I don't think that's the point because it was written on the side, it said something like cleaner, something more efficient. So I think they're making the point that we're cruising around in this car like we're on the beat and it's using less energy and stuff. Yeah. But the first thing I thought of, right, was that those two policemen, they must have been going, oh, Sarge, don't let us have that one. Can't we have the Granada Yeah. I mean, it's so embarrassing. I know, you know, police that, you know, they're doing, you know, but you've. Got to respect them. Yeah, of course. Getting toughs have got to. Exactly. I just don't know if you have to. Well, the only thing more embarrassing. What if you're really tall and you have to climb out of one, You're a copper. Are there any policemen out there who have been asked to drive one of these cars? If you're listening, do you think police listen to this? The only thing that would be more embarrassing is if you had to patrol on one of those bikes the Goodies used to ride. That's the only thing I think that would be more apathetic. A pogo stick. Yeah, it's so embarrassing. Or on roller skates, but not like roller blades, roller skates. Those really old roller skates. Have you seen that you tie on your socks? Yeah. Have you seen those little bikes that look like clown bikes that the couriers use now? They're about a foot high. They're literally my head turned. Yeah, they're really bizarre. Just think they're the ones that they fold up. Yeah, but think of police reject me on that. Well, I always remember, even in America, when I started seeing policemen riding bikes, it didn't seem to me, it seems. Oh, they're quite cool. They're the ones that go through Central park on the mountain bikes. Yeah, but it's really cool, isn't it? You know, it looks like they should be. They whiz along at about 30 miles an hour and they can just. Do you know what I mean? Because like on motorbikes, on a Harley Davidson or whatever. I'm not messing with a cop. A Chips. I mean, chips. Now that's cool. Copper. Yeah. Yeah. But people in a smart car or, you know, that's. It is a bit embarrassing, but I. Suppose it is that or it's better than walking, you see. Next we'll see them in those. If you really want to be kind of worried about the environment. You know those little taxis you see, that people pedal, they peddle around soho. Yeah. And when it's like a. A riot squad, there's four in the back. Yeah, exactly. But that's the thing, right? If. If they need to arrest someone. Yeah, Here we go. Go on. No, what do they do? Because they do only sit two. So do they have to flag a cab down or something for the. We'll give you the money, get a receipt. You definitely will go there. Yeah, yeah, you definitely will. Because we've been caught this way before. Exactly. The last bloke, he just ran off. No, I won't run off. Okay. Okay. Well, I'll tell you what, Mr. Briggs, I'll take your car, then. I'll. Okay, go on, then. Yeah. You definitely bring it back, though. I will, I will. Well, isn't that something in America where when they arrest someone in America, they don't take them back to the station and fill out all the forms. Forms. They just take them back to the station and then they go and fill the forms out in a. Like a cafe or something. So they're still looking out? Yeah, yeah. Carl told me that they're. What, so they're still on patrol? Yeah. So they said they're doing all their paperwork, but they're in the, you know, a cafe window and they're looking out. Do you know, like, how they say in this country so much police time's wasted by having to go back to the office and filling out loads of forms? That sounds like some policeman going, yeah, I could get a lot more work done. Yeah. If I was in a Starbucks. Yeah, yeah. No, there's a lot of criminals in the pub. And if I would, you know, and I get to keep the receipts. Think what's safest is if I didn't wear my uniform and probably got drunk. Yeah, yeah. With some mates or. A lot. A lot happens in, you know, looking out my bedroom window. So if I was just, like. I was snoozing and when I heard a noise, I just popped. Look out. Yeah. Come here. Come here. Apparently, there's a lot of crime in Marbella over the next two weeks. Who has to drive one of those cars? Were you annoyed when you saw it? It's the most embarrassing. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, definitely. No, I think the pogo stick. Pogo stick. The. The triple tandem. We should get that. Carl does all the pedaling. I'm in the basket in the front. Hello, Western Superman. Play replica. What we got? What do you want? Mark the Hoople. Oh, Mark the Hoople. Yeah. Dug out the library. I had one. Had one. It had. Greatest ditch, which was enough, wasn't it? Roll Away the Stone, Coldplay, the Scientist. Have you seen the video for that? No, but. Absolutely magnificent. Is it? It's brilliant. I was the one who's walking backwards in the woods. Oh, yes, I have. Yeah, absolutely. They're great. Yeah. I still haven't worked out how to do that one with the. Whether it's a filter, they just turn up the light because it gets light. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's slow as well, so he. Must have, like, fun to win an award. I'd like him to win awards. I like Coldplay. Yeah, no good. Rick, can I just. Sorry, I don't mean to abuse our position again, but Bruce Springsteen's performing in London tomorrow night, and you remember I made an appeal to try and get a free ticket. Yeah, Well, I don't even mind paying. I. I tried to pay, but. That's good of you. And I thought you were mean. Now, go on, what are you gonna say? All I'm saying is, you know, face value. I mean, you don't want to give me ripped off, do you? No, don't be crazy. You know, ideally, half price. Yeah. And I just. I. I'm. I've been chasing kind of my tail, really. I just. I'm. I'm not going at the moment. I'm not going. And I'm desperate to see in a man. I mean, he's, you know, he's gonna do a great concert. It's his only one in. In London. I can't believe that, being on the radio, being on xfm, you know, the listenership's going up, apparently. I can't believe I can't get a ticket. I've asked Carl. He's done nothing. He's done nothing. No, no, Carl had a very good point. Nothing. Carl, tell what you said when he was whinging. First of all, whilst you moaning, you also asked in the week for a Badly Drawn Boy album. Yeah. You got in today. Yeah. There's one there for you. Well, yeah, but it's ying and yang, and it's like. Yeah, but I don't. You know, Carl, what's Steve ever done for you? That's what you got to ask yourself. What has Steve ever done for you? Well, he took me to the baftas. Yeah. But only because no one else would probably want to go with you. I can't believe that. What is this? I do not believe that. Oh, Steve. I'm gonna stitch you up now, Karl. And it's in a nice way. And don't worry, it won't be too bad. He won't take too bad. Carl sent me a little text message today. Right. Oh, what is this? Right. Okay, okay. You know, I'm in a very frail mood at the moment. No, no, you're like, this improves. This is funny because me and him have been, like, sending trivia back and forth to each other, which is another point. Right. I sent him. Oh, well, I'll get to that in a minute. I thought he'd really be amazed with. Well, while you're fiddling, if you can make my dream come true to go and see Bruce Springsteen tomorrow, then give us a call on the usual number. But like I said, Steve. What? It wouldn't be right. You just said when the song was on. Can't believe it. Right. We work at XFM and I can't get tickets for Springsteen. Right, we work in radio. We should get tickets right now. Think of it. Yeah, well, think of the. Yeah, but if he's sold out, he's sold out. Yeah. Yeah, but that's just something they say. That's just what they say, is it? Right, so everybody on local radio stations say, do you know, I like that Bruce Springsteen. I want a free ticket. Right, so another say, I tried to phone. I phoned for an hour and a half. I couldn't get through. Not long enough. I put the hours in. Not long enough? Not long enough. What are you talking about? Put the hours right? So another 400 people turn up at the gig. They cram them all in. There's people being crushed. You know, they've paid the money early. They were up early that day when they. When the phone lines were open, whilst you were probably sleeping and that. So they're dedicated and they're the ones at the front getting crushed. What? Would you mind be happy if you were there getting crushed. I don't mind. I'll sit at the side of the stage and watch him. Yeah, but I don't mind. But everyone will say that then. And then before you know it, no one can see anything. Right, I'm gonna give you this now. Handing over my mobile phone, Steve, to read the. You can see it's from Carl at the top, but just read it out as you scroll down. Just read it out loud. Is this a text message from. Yeah, this is a text message to me from Carl. Read it out. To see, at night, as well as an owl, you would need eyes the size of grapefruits. If only Stephen could turn his head right round as well. Carl, I can't believe it. What. What upsets me most, Carl, right, is not the fact that you've been slagging me off behind my back. It's the fact that you've got the cheek to come on here and moralize because you failed to get me tickets and make a dre come true. You've come on here trying to pass the buck and say that it's a health and safety problem, when in actual fact, it's a Carl Pilkington. Problem. I'm devastated. I'm devastated, you know, and then I didn't. Let's play a record. I just. I'm up. I should have eaten this banana off. What's the number? It's 087-008-001234. But if it's sold out, Steve, it's sold out. A bit of a classic here. Rm I bet if you wanted to. Go, it'd be fine. I'm sure someone could sort out then who. Oh, if Ricky Gervais wants to go. Are you? No. Electrical storm. That's great. That's great. I Love that. I'm XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl, I want you to tell Steve what you told me in the week about the snake, about the anaconda. How to. Right. This is Carl's method. He's not scared of the anaconda, the 30 foot long, biggest, scariest snake. No. You were talking about stuff, weren't you? About in jungles and that and animals as we do. Yeah, Right. And I remember reading about save. You're in the jungle and. And you get tired and you go to sleep, right. And you. And you sort of wake up and you feel something on your leg and you look down and it's an anaconda, right? Yes. And it's, it's swallowing your feet because they apparently they always go from the feet up. They never, they never eat you from the head. So. Okay, should I save these points to the end? Because. Make a list of the points. Because they always eat head first because the way the fur goes where they have to take a capybara or even a rat, they take it from the head. Okay, so that's gone. We'll come back. Okay, next. Go on. So they always eat you from the feet. Go on. So. So they're swallowing your. And it said on, on the, on the website, if you wake up and you see this anaconda doing that sort of eating away at your feet, don't panic. Don't panic. I'm just writing this down. Don't panic. Hold on. Okay, go on. Don't, don't try and kick it off. Okay, Just let it sort of swallow you, but only up to your knees. Okay. Why not kick it off straight away? Because it, I think it sort of gets a bit angry. It starts thrashing about and it can swallow faster. I think. I'm guessing that bit. Okay, Just put a question mark by that. Okay, pop a question mark. Next to eat. So, yeah, so eat it up to your knees. It's up to your knees. And then what you do is you get a knife. Yeah, okay, and you cut. And how do you get a knife? Do you walk over to the kitchen. I'm just gonna pop over, get knife. Where's that coming from? Get knife. You always have a knife. Always have a knife, otherwise you're a fool. Always have a knife. Okay, well, come on. Yeah, yeah. If you're gonna go into a jungle. Always have a knife. Okay? Always have a knife. Yeah, some parts. Could I just say something? You know, suppose you've got your wearing combat trousers and the knife is actually in that. You know those. The trousers by the knee, the sort of pocket by the knee. What happens then? I suppose you could still reach in, into the mouth, couldn't you? So anyway, you've got a knife. Let's say you've got a knife. Let's say you've fallen asleep. The anacondas, it's chewing your feet. You let it eat up to the knees. You've got a knife. What do you do then? Carl? Right, so he's up to your knees. And what you do, you get your knife that you got out of your pocket earlier and you cut it at the mouth, right? You know, like either side of the lips, right? So you're sort of cutting it in half, right? Like a Chelsea smile. And it can't. Yeah, that's right. It can't do anything. It wasn't ready for that. It can't move about because it's got, like, your legs in its mouth and peel it off and walk away. Okay? My. My main point really is this, Carl. Never will an anaconda or any constrictor, python, boa, constrictor, just start eating a sleeping man. He will crush you to death first. That's why they're called constrictors. They're not called gobblers, are they? Or holy swallowers, they're called constrictors. Why would he start eating something? Is that. Are they to take down antelope? Just start chewing their leg. Oh, it's gone off. I'll tell you what, lads, they get together, the snakes go there and said, I'll tell you what, we're losing a lot of prey by just living at their ankles. They're running. Let's crush them to death first so they can't move. Then we can swallow them. You're a fool. So anyway, right, so I was telling him this bit of information because we started a feature Last week. Well, week before. Sorry, Carl, can we just go back to the crushing you to death first? Yeah, but. Well, I read it. He's one. He's won there. He's beating you there, Rick. Okay. Did he say what to do if it starts with you? That's right. You know what? No, no, no, no, no, no. Did it say what to do if. Supposing it had this meeting. It had this meeting and it started crushing you and you woke up and it was actually round your chest and every time you tried to take a breath and breathe that little bit, it just tightened his grip because it can feel that. What'd you do then? You sort of tighten yourself up anyway, because I've read about that. If one does start wrapping around you, sort of make yourself into a ball first of all, and it'll wrap around you, but it's all right because you're protecting your lungs so it can't crush you. And then you just sort of shout for help and you. And you shout out with this 30 foot snake. Do you know how it works? It gets as tight as it can. It can feel it's tight. It's actually as tight as it can. Right. With these huge, huge muscles. Right, right. When you leave a bit of breath out, it tightens again. Don't. You won't be that out of breath. You haven't been running anywhere, so you can just go. And when do you get the new mouthful of oxygen? Just breathe very slowly like you do. How do you know what breathing is? Do you know what breathing is? It's extending your rib cage. Right? Intercostal muscles between the ribs contract like that, okay. Making the rib cage expand, which pulls air in through. It's like a bellow that you can't just breathe by via the mind. It's a physical process. It's your rib cage. Maybe I'm special, but I can do little breaths without my ribcage. Play a record, Steve. Your special record. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You can't take little breaths without moving your ribcage. Can I just give you the titles because we're running out of time. We've got a competition to do. Okay, all right, let's just leave the anaconda discussion. Why don't you agree to disagree and we'll see who survives if you crash land in the jungle. Right, so what is this? What are we doing now? This is educating Ricky. Oh, good, I'm looking forward to this. Three topics that I teach you every week. Yeah. Now obviously I should just remind people you normally summarize each of these in a kind of bullet point heading which you te. What have you reduced them to this week? Right, we've got Stocking, Aitken and Waterman. Stocking, Aitken and Waterman. Good. Yeah. What else have we got? We've also got. What else is it? It's not his. His vault? Yeah. It's not what? It's not his vault. Okay. Yeah. And we've also got. Get a lobe of this. Get a lobe of this. Yeah. Carl, they're genius. Rick will be choosing one of these after New Order. Oh, Foo Fighters and All My Life on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Jamaica with me, Steve Merchant and Carl D. Just before we do Educating Ricky, this is where Carl thinks he can give me something of interest and teach me something to take away. Last week I found out that somewhere in a strange land people thought tomatoes were poisonous because they ate them with lead, things like that. What was the other one you told me last week? Worms. Yeah. Oh, I sent him a text message. I was on the train, bit bored and I read in, I think it was Metro. Scientists have found out that worms get stressed and they found out that the fat ones didn't live as long. Long. And when they checked the thin ones that lived longer, they found out they had a gene for de stressing them. Right, Carl, what? Did you remember what you said? No, that's stupid in it. He said, did these other ones die of natural causes? I went, yeah. He went, all right, because it could be that the fat ones couldn't get off the pavement quick enough and got squashed. So maybe the scientists go, yeah, we didn't. Yeah, they come think of it, they were flat as well as fat. I think the reason that the worms are getting stressed is because people like Carl are cutting them in half to try and make two steaks. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Two worms. Yeah, that's the concern. He said. He said they can't even commit suicide if they're stressed by cutting their throat. I also sent him what I thought was quite interesting that the science have found that the elephant hasn't got the best memory. The sea lion has. Based on they've got a sea lion and they got it back into the old laboratory ten years after it taught it a simple trick and it could still do the trick. What did you say to that car? I'd say they don't go up to much anyway, so if you do teach you something, it is going to remember it. Sure. Because it's Got nothing else to do. Yeah, yeah. And then also, I mean, I like sea lions. They look nice and everything, but what do they do for. It's another jellyfish as far as I'm concerned. Like, it's there and people know about them, but what do they do? Yeah, what do we do? What do we do, Carl, what do we do? I can't. I can't. First, Steve said. Said it's good for your heart. So why is it all geared to. What'S good for us? Well, anyway, Educating Ricky. Good, we settled that then. Go on. The titles that are meant to sort of pull you in. Yeah, we've got if. What. What was it? Stocking Aiken and Waterman. Yeah, you've got. It's not his vault. And get a low with this. Get a load of this. So which pun do I pick first? I think I'll go for get a lobe of this. Get a lobe of this? Yeah, get a lobe of this. Yeah. Well, that's. That's a story about a girl who. She was deaf, right, For. For four years and it happened quite a bit like this. What year? Or was it. I think it was a bit ages ago. Was it about. Yeah, quite a bit that back. She was deaf for about four years, having an argument with a mum, it said, which I didn't quite understand because I don't know how they do that. Yeah, but she was having an argument. Well. And a man pushed her against the wall and she banged her head and a hearing came back. Okay, was she wearing a Walkman? And it fell out and she'd realized. Oh, there's no explanation. There's no explanation. Well, why is that teaching me something? So I knew you'd say this right, it. So I thought, right, I'll stick something on it. You know that bees are deaf. No, no, you can't just. No, if you ask someone, someone, they don't. The answer. They don't tell you something else. Just. I'll tell you something else, then. I can't answer that. I'll tell you something else. Imagine that if you asked a teacher, look, how do birds fly? Wow. If you're going to do that. Tallest building is. I mean, what. That was the equivalent, Carl, of running away. Yeah, the intellectual equivalent. Okay, look over there as a monster. Listen, what do you mean, what she. Okay, so. Oh, so she. Her hair. There's no explanation. There's no explanation or you don't know? Well, there isn't one. This Lee really the only thing. Doctors not look into it, Nothing. They just said, oh, that's good. Where did this information go? Is that if you read this, there. Was once a deaf woman who ate her head. It was bizarre things about being deaf. Was there three? Like, I've got that book. Yeah, it's a good book that. Was there three more pages you just couldn't be bothered to read off? Yeah. No, no, it was just a little bit and it's. Was there a little picture? A cartoon picture? No pictures. I just. Ow. Look, if you don't want to learn, you know. Yeah, okay. Okay. It's not his vault. Let me have. It's not his vault. You got to save this. This has got to teach me something. It'll be an interesting story. Right. It's not his vault. This fella. What year. Olden times, and I'd say in the seventies. Okay. Would you. Any evidence for that? Does he wear flares in the. In the story? Is that your reason? No, it's. It's a bit like Yori Geller, this fella, right? Where he's electric. He's electric and if he walks past the telly, the telly would fizz. If he walked past the radio, it all goes like that. His hair stuck up all the time and he'd be having a bath and everything would be all right, and then the power would sort of switch on in his body and the electric in his body made him jump out of the bath. So. What do you mean, so? What is that so? What does that so mean? You've given us nothing. You've given us nothing. You'd have to at least give us the scientific explanation. Yeah. Electric eels have 400 volts in them. Oh, is this the running away again? What was that one called? Yeah, but they. It's not his vault. But there's a reason. It's not his vault. It's not his vault. I thought it was gonna be somewhere about it. I think we should do these the other way around. I think you should tell us the story and then we'll hear the pun. It's not his fault. It's not his fault. Right, let's leave it. Play a tune. Forget it. Educating Ricky. Finish. We're not doing it. No, we are. O. What? Don't look at me like that. Oh, Carl, you're in a bad mood. The coral dreaming of you. Right, do the last one. Do the last one. Carl's saying we're never doing this again because we don't appreciate it. Yeah, Carl, you don't know how good this feature is, mate. Right, last one. Yeah. Stocking aiken and Waterman. Go on and tell me about that one. What's that? What am I going to learn from this? Right, well, do you know the saying, Potter? Sock in it. I like already. Do you know the sign? Yeah. Right, well, do you know where it comes from? I assume it's shut up, so I'll stuff your mouth with a sock to shut you up. Years ago. Yeah. Sorry, am I right? No, not really. Ages ago. 1970s, 50s, I'd say. Do you know the old. I'd say, do you know the old gramophone with a big horn on it? Yep. Yeah. Right, well, those stereos didn't have a volume control on them, right. So they'd be listening. So you put a sock in there and you. Mute. You put something like a sock. That's a real one, you see, that's taught me something. That's. That's good. That's excellent, Carl. That is the. That is the only one that counts, like chewing the fat. If they're true. I'm assuming they are. It works. It's of interest. I've got it verified yet. But that is educating Ricky. That's brilliant. I will say the other two were more entertaining. So, you know, do you understand the. Distinction, though, between that one and electrical man and. Or I've hit me and I can hear you, Mum. Yeah. Can you see the difference, though, or. Because I. When I read all three, I took something away from all of them. What did you take away from the electrical man? I just thought, oh, imagine that. Imagine how annoying that would be. But that's not education and it's not taking anything away. Think about it, right? We take our lives for granted all the time. Don't you get up in the morning, it's like, oh, I'll get up and walk for a shower. Some people can't walk, right? This guy, he can't even have a. You know, I mean, it's nice to have a bath in it when you've got time on your hands, you can relax. This guy can't even do that. It might be all right for a bit, but he's not really enjoying it because at any moment it could strike. Yeah. So he can't even do that. He can't calm his hair because it keeps going a mess. Yeah. He can't watch his knocking you. Does he. Does he fight crime? What does he do with his powers? Yeah, I think he just has to sit around because no. 1. He can't work with machinery, Right. Because he'll probably blow a fuse. Yeah. So he just sits Around, Think about. What can he do? Do? What normal things can he do? Skateboarding, Going for long walks. Yeah, put a wetsuit on. They can't do that. Why? Water and electric. No, wetsuits aren't actually wet, they're dry initially. Just put a whole wetsuit on and walk around with flippers. And it's not like a dinner jacket that's like really wet. All I'm saying is think. Do you know what I mean? Oh, okay. The girl death. 4 years it to end. Yeah, that's just. What have you learned from there? What is that? Well, imagine. Imagine how happy you'd be. Remember that time when I, I nearly died when I choked on a Mr. Freeze pop? No, I told you. Tell us again. Yeah, but the people will remember it. And then they were, they weren't listening. Go on, what happened? It was ages ago when my mum and dad used to go out shopping on a Friday, get the food in, get, get a week's load of food in the cupboard and that. And we'd, you know, they'd come in with all the food and we'd all be like, oh God, you know, there's no food left on a Thursday, really. So we'd all be hungry on the Friday by the time the food got in. I love that. But they would need it, I imagine. Like Jackal puppies. Just like, like licking your parents mouth for food as they come through the door. So they come in from the supermarket, they're emptying the box. Our kid had got some biscuits and what have you. I, I frenzy, Just a feeding frenzy, like pigeons. I grabbed the Mr. Freeze Pop and knocked it back really quick. But it hasn't, it wasn't frozen. So I knocked it back. So it was like a liquid and it went down the wrong way. Right. I was choking. Right. And I nearly died. It must have been about. How long can you go before you die? A couple of minutes to do it, I reckon. About a minute 50. Right. I was, I was really close to dying. How do you know you were close to dying? Did your life flash before you? No, but I just was like, like. There'S loads of instances of him eating pops. Yeah, exactly 40 of those. Whatever. Right. What do you think you'd see if your life flashed past you? What do you think? Which elements would stand out for you, do you think? Start now, go back. What do you remember? What's the first thing you remember as a kid? Yeah, just anything now. Being in the hall and having our dog licking me face. That's your earliest memory? Yeah. Okay, What. What's the next one? Right, Next one's probably being at. Being at primary school with Lindsay. Yeah. Was that your girlfriend? Well, a little friend who was a girl. Sure, yeah. And we used to have like tins with. With letters in and you'd have to write stuff. But anyway, what are we doing? Right, so anyway, I'm intrigued by the dog that was licking your face. Well, been that. We won't win that. No, it's a great feature. I just think you need to be a little bit more careful about what you consider education money. All right, well, we'll work on it next week. Play a tune. And what we got for us, Cu? We got big competition. We've only got 20. Come back with Rockbusters. What we playing? Let's play a bit of Tupac. Oh, that's what I'm coming out to in the fight. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, imagine it. Whack it up, whack it up. Two pack California love. Yeah. And that's the big tune that Ricky will be coming out to when he has his celebrity boxing match. All looking forward to that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Competition time. Car. Oh, Carl's looking forward to this. He's just getting all stressed about his half hour. Like it, like Pete. I'll go on. It's just we should have done this a lot earlier. It keeps them hooked in. Right. If you haven't heard the game before, I'll give you some initials. Bit of a cryptic clue. And those initials and the cryptic clue makes up some band. Not. Might not be an XFM band, but it's a band or a pop group or an artist or something. Yeah. What's feature called, though? What's the feature? It's called Rockbusters. Rockbusters, yeah. Do you want to. We do this on email? I think we ought to because you don't like taking calls from the public, do you? Well, you can't work the machine. No, that's absolutely right. It's not that. It's just that then it's pretty fair for everyone. Anyone who's got a computer, you mean. So it's open to anyone who's got, you know, a computer or a laptop at their disposal at this precise moment. Anyway, there's some cracking prizes, Rick, you'll be pleased to know that obviously, once again, Carl has managed to collect together an arbitrary assortment of. Looking around the office. I mean, where did you get these from? Did you just. Did you. I mean, seriously, where did you get them from? Because it's such an arbitrary collection. I don't know what kind of a person would want these items. Right. It's such an arbitrary selection. I don't know what kind of person you'd be. Read them out. What have we got? Well, there's a. Another XFM compilation which obviously you've obviously nicked from somewhere in the office. Yeah, it's a good compilation remix. An album here, which is a promo album with two pigs on the front. I think it's the Smashing Punk Frenzy Live. I can't be certain this is the album. Didn't we give this one away last week? This is just an arbitrary compilation album. Again, one of those kind of. Is that the actual one you didn't send Carl? No, no, we've got a couple of them. Surprise, surprise. The Office on dvd, which is ludicrous. Oh, I've seen it from here. What film? If it. Listen, listen, dear xfm, Listen. Dinner. It's half two. You know, it's just a bit windy out. You're probably gonna stay in this evening. Maybe a bit of shopping you got. And then in a stand's even. Or. What film would you really want? No, I mean, seriously think. If you could see one film, right, what would you want to see? DVD releases. Yeah, yeah, it's great. Put them out there. Misery Steve. They'll be watching this tonight if they're a lucky winner. It's the movie Stigmata. Stigmata with Patricia Arquette and Gabriel Byrne. Oh. So look forward to. That is brilliant. I look at Carl's face, he's actually offended because he puts. He's the only one that puts any work into this show. And he's got competitions, he's got Educating Ricky, Rockbuster, he's got the song with a Story. He's got a song with a story to come that he's, like, trapping. Oh, Gone through him. It's unbelievable. Yeah, so you're playing for that collection of arbitrary goodies. Plus the big prize this week, Stigmata, featuring Gabriel Byrne, about a woman who I think starts bleeding from the hands. It's a horror film. I think you'll have to be 18 or over. It's not. It's not terrible. Sure, it's all right. Is it better than Children of the Corn, which was a big giveaway last week. I haven't seen Children of the Corn. Go on, then. Right, so next week, Teen Wolf 2. Go on. Here's the. And Tony Banks's own solo album, Bank Statement. Tony Banks, remember, is the. The musician from the much loved Genesis. But we got that album to give away. All right. Then. So, right, to win those exclusive prizes, yeah. You've got to email in ricky.gervais fm.co.uk. I saw a Sellotape dispenser out in the. There's a pair of gloves. I don't know who's out, but they're out there and they've been there for a week. So, pair of gloves, dispenser and Tony Banks's solo album bank statement. Yep. Okay, got one. All right, first 1. Initials JT Initials JT what's the cryptic clue? Cryptic clue. At the moment, I'm in a river full of logs. Hold on. Yeah. J.T. and what's the. Clear again. At the moment, I'm in a river full of logs. Full of logs, yeah. Okay, so who could it be? Jt at the moment, I'm in a river full of logs. Yeah, go on. That's like. Come on. There's three of them. You gotta get. Letter is W. W. Yeah. The clue. That lad's got bad asthma. That lad has got bad. I've got that one already. I've got that one already. Yeah. And finally, the last one is the letter C. Yeah. And the cryptic clue is. Carl, is one of these. Mousetrap is that musical, isn't it? This isn't a clue, by the way. It is called Mousetrap, isn't it? It's not a musical, but it's a. Who done it sort of thing. Yeah, fine. Right, here's a clue. I saw that. Imagine that on the real block. Yeah. Bob, Owen is going on. Can we stop a minute? Oh, you with the nine teddy bears there. Mouse up. That's a show in it. I think so, Bob. Yeah. Right. Okay, here we go. Yeah. Yeah. So the letter is C. And the cryptic clue. I saw that mouse trap the other night, but the eating in the. In the theater was knackered. The heating in the theater was knackered. Right. Ruining it. Well, we've got that one already as well. Yeah. I mean, these are. The first ones are hard, but just. A quick reminder, JT was the first one. At the moment, I'm in a river full of logs. Full of logs, yeah. Okay. Second one, W. That lad's got bad asthma. And the last one, C. I saw that mouse trap the other night, but the. The heating in the theater was knackered and it ruined the whole thing. Okay. And ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk is the email address. You can win. I'm confused. A stigmata. I'm in a. Full of logs. I'm In a river full of logs. Well, we'll do it in about 20 minutes. Yeah. You've got to stay tuned for the answers. It's not. It's not the quickest, so don't go rushing and sort of messing it up. Think about it. And it's random email anyway, so there's no rush. All right. And if you want to email, you're welcome to say, please do not send me the prizes even if I win. Or even put that on there if you don't want that junk in your house. Right. The reason we're, you know, we usually sort of play a record out of an outbreak, don't we? Carl is so concerned with his little competition, he hasn't got a record ready. Sure, yeah. Do you want to do a quick recap, even? Just say it. I'm not interested. Yeah, go on, quick. Still, send your emails in jt, it's some initials of a band, just in case you didn't hear it last week. If I said AK and an exploding pest, that would be Atomic Curtain. Yeah. Right. They know what a clue is. So, jt, at the moment, I'm in a river full of logs. W. That lad's got bad asthma. And see, I saw that mousetrap the other night. The heating wasn't working. It ruined the night. And. Yeah. Ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk. some stuff. Stigmata. We have Gabriel Byrne. Richard Ashcroft. Check the meaning. I love that. That's Brilliant. On XFM 104.9, Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkerton, who's our producer. No, but he's getting it. But it's more like it now. In it, before he was someone who pressed the buttons, then he was so many. Press the buttons. Who we just made talk like a performing monkey. I hear he's going to be lured away by the Today program on Radio 4. They've lost news editor. I think Educating Ricky quite topical. Absolutely it, isn't it? Yeah. Well. So when you say topical, this is what? Topical. Well, this happened ages ago. Yeah. Your words, not mine. Have they got a Ricky who works there? We can look into that. So they've got to be given away. This is Rockbuster. We've got obviously the big price stigmata this week. I'm not going to give the price to. To Ira. I think it's Era or Ira, but she. She or he emailed in the right answers and then said, if you could enclose the receipt for stigmata, that would be much appreciated. I'M amazed by the number of responses we've had. And someone wants a copy of Tony Banks's solo album, which I was mucking around. So we better buy that in the week to give it away because I think that'd be amazing prize to give away. If you just give. The clues. Are. Right. Well, the one that everyone was struggling with was the first one. Yeah, I'll save that. So we'll go to the second one. Double your. You. Yeah, that lad's got bad asthma. Yeah, we know that, Weezer. Yeah. The last one, C. The clue was, I saw that mousetrap the other day. The heating was knackered. In the restaurant. Yeah, in the restaurant in the theater. Yeah. And it ruined the night. Yeah. So it was a cold play, wasn't it? Yeah, that's a cold play. And jt, at the moment. No, I can't think of this one at the moment. I'm in a river full of logs. Well, I had to say there were some wrong answers. What was it again? It was just in Timberlake. Justin Timberlake. We had some wrong answers that included Jethro Tull and James Taylor. I don't know how that relates to it. I'm annoyed at Lake when he clearly said river. I mean, that's the first thing that cropped up. Not, I'm in some water full of logs at the moment. Yeah, I'm in some water full of logs. But he actually had to say river, so not Lake. That annoys me. I mean, I didn't get it. Fair enough. I should have worked it out. I should have tried to think like you. It. A lot of people obviously think like you, which is. Which I'm, you know, worried about, but yeah, jt, James Taylor. Just guessing. Yeah, James Taylor works. Have we got a winner? Stevie's just gonna randomly. I did have a winner. I've just. I've just lost them. Oh, needless to say, that lucky person. Won'T be watching Stigmata tonight. Just randomly. It's a draw, by the way. It's not the first time. Okay, I'll just. I'll. I said to Carl in the bright. I said, it's the first one. And he went, no, I don't want a competition that relies on speed because I don't want to be rushed. Okay, so randomly click on someone. I'm just gonna randomly click on one. Go on. There's not. They've not put an address. Well, what we can do, we can email back and say, send us your address. Of course you can. I think if they haven't put an address. Well, no. All right, all right. Yeah. Chris Beaumont. Lucky Chris Beaumont. Chris Beaumont will be watching Stigmata tonight with a club of Haagen Dar, if I'm not much mistaken. He'll be loving it. Well done. Needed a dress. Right, that's the end of that competition. Right. Can we play a record or something? We're on to another feature. Oh, what is this? This one is. Rick, were you not at the planning meeting? What is this? Go on. This is. That song's got a good story in it. Oh, is this that? Oh, God. So tell us the rules. Right. The rule is that it's songs that we play on the show every week and there's a lot of music out that they just keep saying the same. I'll just say, what is it? What's the song with the story this week? What's the song with the story this week? Just say it. It's Gene Pitney, 24 hours from Tulsa. Oh, really? Sorry about this. If you're an XFM listener, we got to listen to this. Go on. Well, do you know what it's about? Yeah. Isn't he getting. Trying to get back to his girlfriend? Yeah, he's been working away. Lives in Tulsa, but he works quite far away. Right. And he's. Could this save us having to listen to song? Well, it's always good to sort of. Hear the story before you hear the story. It's like, it's like, you know, I. Like this before a film. Yeah, you might. You might read the book before you see the film. Film type thing. Yeah. So never in my case. He's working. He's working miles away. His misses Is in Tulsa. He's driving back and he can't wait. He's only about 24 hours away and he's all about. He's about 24 hours away and he's a little bit tired on the way home. He's thinking, oh, I don't want to look a mess for when me misses Sees me. So he says, all right, I'll stay at a motel. Get some energy in that, you know, for when I see you have a shake. So he pulls over at a motel hotel and he's locking his car up, getting his suitcase out the back. There's a woman in the car park. He's like, oh, she's all right. She looks at him, he thinks, I. Don'T think the suitcase in the boot is mentioned in the song. I think that's maybe a 12 inch mix or something. I've not heard that well, basically. Right, I'll play the record. For Christ's sake. Let them listen to it. I don't remember him saying. Cool. She looks all right. Go home again. Yeah. Well done. Yeah. 24 hours from Tolsta Gene Pitney song with the story. You are quite upset by the lyrics of that song, aren't you? I just think it's a bit annoying that. Right. He loved this woman. Yeah. Everything's going fine. He's only 24 hours away from home. I don't know how, what sort of distance he's done, but he can't wait to get home. And all it took was some woman in the car park to sort of. I've given the eye. Give it an eye and every. All the. All the. All the. Like the good times he's had with his misses Go out the window and. I don't know, that's the dangers of falling in love with a prostitute. What I like about it though is the fact that he's writing this to his ex girlfriend. He's like talking about rubbing it in. I was kissing her and getting off with her. We haven't explained it though. Yeah. Yeah. But did you hear the very end? Because he's a loser. Because he's said and he can never go home again. Yeah. So even though he's got this new girlfriend and that you can't see his old mates. He has falling in love with. Can't see his old mates anymore. He said he can't see his old mates anymore. Next time you stop at the Granada services on the way back from, you. Know, Swansea, there was a song bit like that by Jim Reeves probably at about the same time, a little bit before. Right. It was just called just 100 miles from Marianne. Right. And it was him and his horse going through the snow. And he was stopped at a little chef. Yeah. He fancied another donkey. No, but it's really sad. It's made me cry when I was little because he's got there, right. And he wouldn't leave old Ben the horse and they. And he dies in the snow. And then. So he dies in the snow. He's gone again. He's gone again. Now I get the same way. Teary eyed with two little boys. Yeah. No, I don't like that. Well, not. It's just. You think I'd leave you dying when there's room on this horse for two. Climb up here, Jack. We'll soon be flying back to the rank. So blue. It was just like when they were playing with a little horse's head when they were little and he was a soldier and he helped him and he returned the favor in a war, which to me is a bigger favor than just letting him have a go on a hobby horse. But a lot, lot braver if you, you know. But yeah, last number one of the 60s as well. Christmas 1969. And of course, based on truth, that it's actually. That's a history lesson right there. It is based on fact. It's a famous, famous person. I think it was Winston Churchill and Cromwell. Yeah, it was Cromwell. Cromwell and Winston Churchill. Yeah. They were both lived ages ago. So they lived at the same time. Literally ages ago. So they lived at the same time. Yeah. Well, that's it then, is it? Yeah. Were you listening to anything we were saying then, Carl? Did you understand any of that? That me and Steve were just chatting. About saying that Rolf Harris did a good song about someone who's got to carry on a horse. Right. And what was about the stuff about Cromwell and Winston? What do you think that was about? I missed that. We're doing humor. We're doing a little bit of humor. It was a satire on you saying ages, not being specific. Do you did. Do you like that stuff? We do? Yeah. That's it then. Just a cat looking out a window. A dead mouse or something. It can't. You can go, come here. And it's just looking at the mouse. It could eat. You want to. You want to press the button to finish, don't you? Yeah. What are you going to do, Play record or. No, that's it. It's ads and that's it. Okay, good. Goodbye. What a wonderful ending.",
