Whose birthday it is today. Yeah. Someone never listened before and I heard that link. They think it's great. It's proper radio at last. XFM 104.9. Just gone five past one. Steve, do you want some great music? I'd love to hear some great. Well, I've brought in some good stuff. I've bought in Oasis, we've got Radiohead, I've got some album, I've got some Jimmy Webb. I'm looking forward to that. Yeah. You know, we're keeping it real. Oh, absolutely. I've got Charlatans, I've got Nirvana, any Sade. There's no Shard, that's a show. But I've been looking through the library and I have found four non blondes. Brilliant. Looking for yesterday. Looking forward to that later. Yeah, yeah, it was. It was Carl. It was you that worked out the maths and worked out I was 28. Because they just worked out I'm 27. You are 27. No way. Yeah. I. I asked you, didn't I? And I said no. But what I sort of questioned was, I said, well, if you're 27 today, that means last week you were 26. Well, well done. Yeah. That's irrelevant. So therefore you assumed that I must be 28, then? Yeah. Whereas I assumed you were using, you know, your knowledge of maths, such as it is. I wouldn't do that. No. Sure, sure. Wow. I actually got lost in that conversation because I didn't genuinely didn't know what he meant. Would mean. Last week you were 26. I don't know what that meant. You don't know what it meant? Wow. Well, it is Steve's birthday. He would have been 26 last week. Sometimes you genuinely frighten me because it's those staring eyes. There's nothing behind him. It's this little bald head. Look, Davros looking at me. Genuine. Just genuine fear on his face when he enters into a conversation with another human being. What bit don't you understand? If he. If he's 27 today, he would have been 26 last week. And he doesn't look 26. He didn't look 26 last week. He looks older than 28 today. You've started on his birthday. You're still having a go at him. I don't look like the kind of hot stud that I actually Am. But face facts, that's the truth. Yeah. Live with it. Get program. Jeez. Well, let's have a, let's have a little bit of cake, okay. Oh, that's appropriate. You mean the band, don't you? Not the cake. You haven't actually bought cake, have you got anything at all? Cake, Short skirt, long jacket, sort of fashion, sort of. Sure. Single. Yes. Yeah. Oh, I got, Oh, I just remembered something like short skirt, long jacket. Once I was watching daytime tv, I was unemployed. It was, it was the early days of, you know, it's about mid-80s. And who was hosting it was, it was sort of like one of those aiming Holmes and someone. Or like, you know, you know, not, not, not as good, not as. And then lynch, he went, well, after the break, Leo Sayer's popping in. Tell us about clothes. The shorter man. I stayed tuned. He came on, he went, yeah, he went, wear a short jacket. Why wear a short jacket? Optical illusion. You're going, well that jacket, it couldn't be a foot long. Cause that'd be mad. So it's two foot long. So he's six foot. So I'm looking at him there, I'm looking. Don't get too close. Just look at the jacket. How tall are you, Leo? Well, work it out. This jacket's presumably, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, of course it is. Yeah, yeah. But Leo, you're famously quite a short man. In fact, I saw you on TV talking about clothes for the shorter man. No, but look at the jacket from there. Yep. You must be about 6 foot. So you had to walk around looking like a bull fighter just for this illusion, like 50 paces. What's the other thing about stripes? Is it. Yeah, yeah. Horizontal stripes widen, you make it fatter. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So good advice, a good fashion advice for Anyone listening on XFM 104.9, Leo Sayer, they're offering some topic. We should get Leo in, maybe offer some new stuff for your birthday. A little special Leo Sayer visit for your birthday. Got any presents yet? I've got, I've received nothing yet, but my parents haven't come up and they're the ones that normally bring gifts. Oh yeah, they are coming up later and I always look forward to my father's gifts. Yeah. Because they are remarkable. He, I, I don't know what he's thinking sometimes. I mean, I don't, it's like I don't understand the logic. I mean, if I explain some of the gifts he's bought in the past, maybe you could figure out. I Once opened, I think I was about 14. Right. And I liked all the stuff that you like at 14. You know, the ladies, obviously. You know, pop music. Yeah. You know, fashion. Yeah. And that's why, I assume that's why he bought me on audio cassette, the collected Wartime speeches of Sir Winst Churchill. It's a good gift. Did you listen to him? Well, I, I, I'm not sure when you'd ever be in the mood to listen to that, to be honest. Fight, we'll fight you on the beaches yeah. You know, all that. All the classics, all the classic hits. I don't know any. I think the. Unless you're under attack. I don't think you'd ever listen to that. Did you not even listen to it? I kind of stuck. But what. When are you gonna, when are you gonna be in the mood to put that on? No, but just because it was a gift. But I always remember being once. This was. What if you tested it? Go work. It's like track four. Oh, some chicken. Some neck. Oh, I love that, dad. Yeah, Yeah, I think remix. But he said to me once, he said to me, never forget, son. He didn't. And I went, I don't, I don't remember dad. It was mad. And it was like. Because he was quite into sort of. But he was into like the military and all that kind of. And war history and stuff, so. Are you allowed to tell an anecdote about your dad on radio? Can I just give you a clue just in case? Can you tell the thing about the shed? No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Too complicated, too long. All right. Okay. But, but I remember this was, this is true. I remember we would. I had it on once because I sort of. I just stuck it on because I thought I ought to. My dad came and he was like, he was pleased to see I was listening to anything. We just sort of stood there listening. And I always. With my sister coming in with one of her quite attractive friends, teenage friends as well. And I'm a teenager as well. And it's like. And just, just this woman walking by, you know, she goes to the same school or whatever, you know, quite, quite fit. And I'm just stood there with my father listening to. We all fight them on the beaches. Never in the field of human conflict of so many. And just, just remember looking at. As he passes, just. You learn it. See, it's rubbed on. Oh, yeah, yeah. You know, it's. Oh, Rick. If you're ever in a war situation and you need some morale, come to me. Yeah, you'll just point me out. What about a little bit of White Stripes? Oh, I've got some more gifts I can tell you about afterwards. Well, I'm looking forward to it. Oasis, Morning Glory. Before that, White Stripes, Hotel Yorba. Oasis, of course, Think got in the. Have you been watching that VH1 Top 100 album? I have indeed. I've enjoyed it. Yeah. Number one. Do you remember what number one was? Joshua Tree. You too. Yeah. Now, good album. It's not the greatest album ever, is it? Of all time. I mean, I know it's an arbitrary list, but even so. Yeah, you sort of feel comfortable with it being the Beatles or. Exactly. You kind of even Pet Sound. Exactly. And then. Yeah, maybe. I don't think. Maybe it's a generation shift. There's enough people now. But it was. What I found odd in the list was it's like it started off with. I think it was like the Doors. I remember there was Lava Underground and stuff. You know, these kind of respected album classics. And then there was things like, you know, stars, Simply Red. I mean, it was a big seller and it's well produced, whatever, but an odd choice for the greatest albums ever. And then I remember there was things like that Texas album. Yeah. Is it White? White on Blonde or whatever it was. And I just think, again, is it just based on albums that have sold well, you know, via the Britannia music. But that's. That's always the thing, isn't it? It's like any. Any poll. Like I remember, I think it was last year, the greatest lyrics of all time. One was imagined by John Lennon, which is, you know, you know, if anything. It'S a solid classic. And. And there was like, you know, maybe a Dylan or another Beatles one. And in two in the top five was Robbie Williams songs. Robbie Williams, Yeah. One of the worst lyricists ever. Well, just. Just a collection of words. Yeah. Just well annoying. Yeah. I think, you know, and it was that thing, a man, a thousand fags. You know, like, I'm a dad and that's gonna take you to the bridge. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. But that's just. That's a reflection of the. The sheer weight at the moment, isn't it? So it's always going to be 4 of all time and then the biggest thing that year. I suppose so. But that's. I mean, that's why Cole playing Travis again. And they're good, but I mean, you know, I don't think they'd be at the same position next year. No, I think, you know what I Mean, it's just. Yeah, but it's just. I mean, I get frustrated with those lists because I always. They just. They just always seem so arbitrary. I think we've forgotten we're on the radio because that was a pretty boring link, wasn't it? Because we're just talking like we're alone. A lot of people probably haven't even seen the VH1 show. Yeah. Not interested in the ladies. Are we losing it? Are we? You know, I mean, listen, I'll be. Honest with you, Rick. I. It's my birthday today. Last night I went out, I got. I got a little bit wasted. Yeah. So I'm. I'm quite. I'm hungover this morning. I didn't get to bed before 11. Right. So it's like. It's like. I don't think too much. No, I'm pretty. I was pretty wild last night, in actual fact, and I have to say, I went. God knows how many units I had. I went to the Monarch in the Camden. There was some kind of groovy night on. I went to the door, I got a load of mates with me. I said, any discount for XFM DJs? You didn't really. I did. I did. I was a bit drunk. He went, who are you? I went, steve Merchant. Ricky Gervais. He went, steve Merchant, brilliant. You can come in for free. No, he did. Yes, he did. I swear to God. He said, yes, you did. He said. And I said, oh, but mates. He went, it's five pounds. They can have a pound off. He said, but. And I think basically. But basically, Rick, I think I also agreed that you'd DJ there. I can't remember. But if. If the guy is listening, he could maybe let us know if I promised that I might have signed something. I can't remember. Oh, God. Oh. Anyway, it was a good night. One of those 50s sitcoms, when. Yeah. Yeah. You sold my soul to an angel. Exactly. Oh, how am I going to get out of this? Yeah, exactly. Oh, no. So, anyway, if you go down to the Monarch, maybe next week. Ricky Gervais playing. That'll be fun. Well, that was Elbow Red off. Asleep in the back. I love that. Got. Got sort of early Peter Gabriel and. That's wonderful. Well, we were. We're talking about, like, your birthday and everything. Yes. Presents. And then. Then I found out I'd been signed up to DJ Yes Club in Canada. Looking forward to that. To get you in to. I got him for free. My friends got in £1 off. I was just. When the record was Playing there. I said, see, why did you do that? Why did you try and get in free? Right. He goes, impress my mates. Now, how impressive is it that Steve Merchant can get you in a place for a quid off? Yeah. You won't save money with Steve. If they recognize him or have heard the show, you get a quid off. That is great. I have a quality discount. I don't know whether what you like more, though, because I know you. And I think it wasn't just the acclaim and the fact you wore it, it was the pound off. You liked the money off was exciting to me. That was great. Any discount would have been fine. I imagine you made them all buy you a drink for the. You know, to the value of a pound. It ended up costing them a lot more. Yeah, exactly. Well, I. Did. I. Have I ever. This is the. Probably the most embarrassing of those entrance stories. Yeah. I was down in South London once. Went down to some party that was taking place in some kind of swanky bar where there was a doorman on the front and a charge. I think it was something mental, like a tenor to go in. It was crazy. It was some. It was ludicrous. I don't know what I was doing down there. And I was in the. Establish what you mean by swanky later, because that could be. And it was. It was always a posh place. And so there's a queue outside and there was one of these doormen who thought it was like kind of Studio 54. He was like, sort of, you know, choosing people who could come in. Yeah, YouTube come in now. You know, I've been there for ages. Obviously I was on my own. Exactly. I've dressed up for this. And there are these two girls next to me. I'm thinking, if I'm in a queue. I've told you before, if I'm in a queue. And I got. If I'm stuck with two girls, you know, I'm thinking, what a great opportunity, you know, use the old Merchant charm. Yeah, yeah. And so I'm there and I'm sort of thinking, I'm sort of. You know, I kind of, sort of give them a nod or whatever, you know, a wink. Yeah, they're loving it. Yeah. They move to the back. They're putty in my hands, Rick, as you can imagine. Yeah, yeah. And I thought, well, to really seal this off, I'll get us in, like, I'll sort of skip the queue. So I. The guys were coming along, he's picking people off the doorman. And I just grabbed Him. I just grabbed him like that and I said it so everyone could hear, right. I thought this was brilliant. I said to him, how much is it? He went, ten quid. I went, I'll give you seven. That was my bribe. I'll give you seven. That's the whole three pounds. No, that can't be right. No, no, I get. He must have said a fiverr. And I said, I'll give you seven. Yeah, that makes more sense. That's. That's giving him a two pound incentive. Two pound incentive. I'll give you seven. You can make up the ten. You. You can. If you let me in, you can put in three yourself, mate. That never works, does it? He said to me, he said to me, I can't be bothered. I've got. I'm just gonna have a kip, I think. Was it percentages that put you off initially? I mean, it's a funny anecdote when you're giving him £2. It's even funnier when you're getting. When he's paying me as well. Oh, I love it. Right, we're gonna play a record then we're really going to concentrate. XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais Show. Steve Merchant's also involved. Oh, no. Cypress Hill Superstar. Still to come, we've got such great bands as New Order, Ash, Nirvana, Radiohead. Song for the lovers at about 2 o'clock is a beautiful. So Jimmy Web, looking forward to it. Now it's Steve's birthday. It's XFM 104.9. He's 27. Yes. We're both a little bit hungover. Yes. Now every link we've started hasn't really sort of. It's not really come to fruition. No. Being honest, nothing's happened. I mean, sometimes there's just. They're just all out kind of. They're just blunders in them. Yeah. Or like this one. We've already run around. Yeah. I think it might be a mixture of us. Like we've been on this station for a little while. We're losing the will live forward, but we're gonna buck up our ideas. Can I just ask. I said buck up, by the way, just in case. A quick question though, because I'm listening to answer Complain. My. My birthday today and therefore last night I went out and you know, that's why. Excuse for being a little bit tired, a little bit hungover. Yeah. What's your excuse? Because you didn't come out. No, no. I mean, you conscious you had the show Today, what were you doing? Staying at home? Just drinking. Yeah, Having a little. A couple. Me and Jane went, what time? Say goodbye to someone about one. Well, that's stupid. What I'm saying is. No, I mean, it's your name all over the show, you know, I'm a nobody. I got no reputation. Yeah. Although you get a quid off in most clubs in Camden, I think. Just. Just drop if anyone out there, if you're sort of like. Like tall, so answering your birthday. But I'm just going to do a description. This is purely. This is nothing nice. If you're sort of like a lanky sort of geek and you, you know, you can do a words and accent, then maybe you can pretend to be Steve Merchant and getting quid off. Is that right? That's fine. No, because some people would take that. As a personal offensive. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we were talking about, should we play record? Is that link too long already before we actually got to summer? I'm already bored. Because we've got to get to something. We've got to do something. Why don't you contribute something? You're being silent now. That is scraping the bottom. We're in trouble. Oh, no. Oh, we're failing. Who can we. Who can we bring on that? Surefire always delivers dynamite. Yeah, Carl, the big guns. Come on, Carl. I was just thinking, there is nobody else who looks like Steve. He's done. Yeah. That's outrageous. Although, to be honest with you, that insult is resurrected things. Yeah. Well done. Play a little tune and then we've. Got a little bit of a sniffle as well, I think. Yeah. Cold or something. Could be coming on. Bit late there, Carl. You should come in a bit earlier there. Suede there. What I like is the complete lack of professionalism on our part. Yeah. It's like we've got a bit of a headache, a little bit tired. Just. That's it then. You can't fight that. You can't fight that. Well, I mean, the thing is, as you well know, Rick, There are certain DJs on this station, you know, drunkards. There's at least two I know of who were smack heads. Yeah. And you know, they still manage, but they still managed. Even the ones that aren't that try their best are rubbish. That's true. No, I'm not saying. I'm not saying we're still not the best. Yeah. It's effortless for us. I know. Yeah. Yeah. We're coming up with dynamite stuff here. Yeah, I know. We're not even, you know, fighting on. All cylinders, XFM 104.9, Ricky Gervais with me, Steven Merchant. A little bit hungover. We all are, but he's. He can't really take it. He said no, wait, there is tickets to give away, Rick. I don't know if we should mention that. What? Who is it for? Joe Strummer. Oh, yeah. And his band, the Mescaleros play Brixton Academy. We think this evening a little bit more information will probably be. So go along. Just in case you say you're Steve Merchant, pound off. Well, the doors are at seven o'clock and it's £17 50. Unless you've won the competition, Rick, that I'm about to set. And won yourself a pair of tickets. There is someone, right, in America celebrating a birthday today. Okay. Yeah. More than one. Yeah. No, no, but there's a specific one I'm thinking of. Right. His name, Rick, is Dwight Schultz. Okay. Yeah. If you know the answer, obviously, don't give it away. Yeah, his name's Dwight Schultz. He's an actor. Yeah. He's particularly big in the 80s. Yeah. And he's also celebrating a birthday. You're saying what's his name? I'm gonna say, what character is he best known as? What TV character is he best known as? And you can win yourself some tickets for Joe Strumming the Mescaleros at the Brixton Academy. Dwight Schultz, American actor, TV character of the 80s. Very famous. Oh, yeah. See, Christian's giving away a trip to Salem, Massachusetts. That's bizarre, actually, because I was in America recently. I went to Salem, Massachusetts, and that's not a prize, believe me. If you. I mean, we were there. We were so obliged to go because we were at someone's birthday. It's rubbish, really. I mean, that's a really poor trip. That's such a. He's probably. You probably can't believe his luck. It's probably the biggest thing Christian's ever had to give away, and you've just dissed it. The great thing about Salem, Massachusetts, is. That I don't think we're. I don't think we're good for this station. I don't think we're selling this station like we should. Well, you know, it's its own fault, you know, it shouldn't have hired us. I blame it, you know. Yeah. And paid us in advance. Yeah. They're lucky we turn up. No, I went to Salem, Massachusetts, and this is the place that's famous from, like, Salem's Lot and the Salem Witch. Hunts famously Famous for all things Little Salem. Yeah. Anything with Salem in the title. The whole place has gone mad over, like witches and anything, basically. It's like there was the Salem witch hunts in like 17 something or other or 16 something or other. So the whole place now is just full of, like, people dressed as witches. Yeah. And then it's like any supernatural stuff. So that I went in and it was amazing. It's quite a Glastonbury tent. It was. Yeah. It's. It's like, it's awful. Everything, every single place there, every single shop, is kind of horror related. Yeah. And I went to the Boris Karloff World of Terror. Yeah. It's amazing you went in there. I don't know if Boris, the famous horror actor, has actually been involved, but you go in there, you walk in the door, you've got all these 3D glasses on, right. And it's supposed to be this kind of chilling journey around, this kind of like a sort of a crypt, you know, and you put these glasses on. I couldn't tell. They were so poor. I couldn't tell what was supposed to be a 3D effect and what was actually three dimensional, really, in real. So I couldn't tell if, like, the floor was actually sloped or if it was. Just appeared to be. Yeah. Whether the war was actually kind of knobbly or whether it was. And it was. It literally took about 45 seconds to get through it. Imagine blinking into the dark, into the light again. It was so you. You. So. I just want. I just want to throw us over to Carl. So there's Steve Merchant with funny glasses on in this place. Horror. And he's walking around. Do you think he scared people, Carl? I've. I've set this question out, haven't I? I've loaded the question. I know the answer. You're fishing for Carl's. You just want to have a dig at me because it's coming up to 2:00 and you've not really put a lot of effort in today, slagging me off. No, he doesn't. He's just. He's just an honest northerner and he can't lie. He's like George Washington but without the wooden teeth. Yeah. Salem. We'Ve lost it again. This is such bad radio. I mean, genuinely, this is bad radio. A quick. Oh, yeah. My mate went to one of those things in the West End where you walk around and it's aliens and they jump out at you. Right, right. And he was so scared with alien jumped out. I mean, he ripped a Bit of his face off. And the aliens face off. Yeah, it was foam. And the bloke went, don't do that, mate. Brilliant. Well, in the, in the Salem one, I was wandering around and this was one guy that kept jumping out because there was about 10 of us. I was at the back. I always missed him jumping out. So when I got around I, I missed all the frights. Oh, no, he. At least you thought he'd like jump out then double round and jump out again. Yeah. Everyone catch that? No, we. All right. Okay. Move on. Oh, if you want to win those tickets. 087-008-001234 Dwight Schultz. Who is he better known as. Yeah. Basement Jacks. They're keeping it real. Where's your head at? Where is your head at? Yeah, I know what they're saying. They're saying, where's your head at? Where is your head at? Yeah. Xfm104, Ricky Gervais. Now, I just. One thing I would say, Rick, is that I've spoken to a few people who've listened to the show and a lot of people, you know, this is the highlight of their week. It really is. No, a lot of bed bound people. And you know. Yeah. And, and we're not putting that, we're not really not putting the effort. You know, we're providing nothing. We're trying, but it's just not coming out right. The words aren't coming out when I say them. In my mind, they're brilliant. But it's sort of like getting old. You know, you might, you know, I still want to run upstairs and things, but I just lift. I'd like to run upstairs. I just, I just can't anymore. And I, I thought that today I really. The comet is in there. The interesting things, it's all in the head and it has to go via the mouth. Yeah. And it's just not, it's just not working for me. But it is your birthday. You're 27. Happy birthday. We're talking about. Can I tell you one of the best presents I ever had about. Without doubt. All I ever wanted was a go kart. This is true. I was like, you know, sort of five, six, seven. And I eventually, for Christmas, I wasn't sort of spoiled in the sense that I got pocket money, but I always got what I wanted at Christmas eventually. Because, you know, like, you know, working class mothers, they, they'd get out the catalog and pay for it for the rest of the year. So, you know, I always got, I'd, you know, really you know, as many presents as anyone else. And I got this go kart. It was a little red go kart, and it was a pedal one. And I'd run home from school and I'd be in it, and I'd go up and down the garden for hours. I have to come in for my tea. And this was fantastic. And this went on for, like, weeks and weeks and went through the summer. The next time, it just fantastic go kart. I'd show off and. And then one day I came home and I went. It was always at the back of the shed, sort of up against the shed. And I went in. I couldn't see it. And so I went to the back door. My mom was sort of like, washing up with that. And I went, where's my go kart? I thought, it hasn't been nicked. She went, your dad swapped it. Your dad swapped it? Yeah. I went, hey, what? And I was going to be brave. And I went, he what? She went, he swapped it for a wheelbarrow. And I could see she didn't approve of this, and she was thinking, I'm gonna tell him. And then I'm gonna, you know. You know, have this out. And I went, right. She went, it's your wheelbarrow. And I went to the back of the shed, and there was this wheelbarrow. He swapped it with a bloke. Jimmy Dublin. Yeah. I don't know. He was a respectable member of the community. He was fine. It was his library. No, I think he was an Irish gentleman. And that's why I don't know what his real name was. And I think my dad must have been drunk. And he went, you know, I want to get my son a go kart. And my dad, well. Well, we've. My kid's got one. He's probably had it for a year. He's probably bored with it. Yeah. And, you know, I'll give you this wheelbarrow. And I went, this wheelbarrow. And it was caked in concrete. I could hardly lift it. I just nicked off a building site, obviously, and I'd be there for hours trying to push this wheelbarrow up and down the garden. Right. And it was okay, though, because I was going on holiday soon, and I am seven years around and went to Bognor Regis place called Riverside, because some woman around the. Why? I had a. A caravan that we got free for a week, and it was great, just wonderful. And I used to go there with my mum and my nan. Oh, party time. Yeah. The ages seven to Sort of. No, it's good because, you know when you're a kid and you wake up in a strange place, it sort of seems weird. You wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning hearing your grand pissing in an iron bucket and you know, you've all been there. You get. You get this orientated. Anyway and that. Well, they. And I met a. A little friend who's about my age, we're both sort of like, all right. And he'd hired a go kart. He had this great co. Go cart and he came around, he came down to my caravan and I went, I've got a go kart. And my mum. I remember my opening the window of the caravan and going, don't lie. And I went, I. I had a go kart. I had a go cart. Wow. Yeah. Did you ever talk to your father about the fact you swapped it? You never mentioned it. No. No. You still got that wheelbarrow? I think so. I've grown into it. Yeah. Yeah. I can nearly lift it now. Yeah. And now I'm just too old to run up and down the garden now. You get one of your several gardeners, you use it all the time. Dry there, Dr. Dry. Of course. Bad intentions. Well, it's. Oh. Do you want to give the winners of the competition? The winners? Yes. Tickets for Joe Strummer, the Mescaleros playing at Brixton Academy this evening. We have some lucky winners. The question I set was someone else famous is celebrating a birthday today. Yeah. I don't mean someone other. Someone else famous. Like I'm famous and someone else. You could probably get into the Monarch. Well, pound off at least. Yeah. And I said, yeah, which actor? Dwight Schultz. No, I didn't. I said, which character? Started off well, didn't it? It started off so well. Which character did Dwight Schultz play? What made him famous in the 80s? He said, I rank your birthday today. I don't know how old he is. Probably in his 60s. Not in his 60s. The character he played, of course, was Howling Mad Murdoch. Yeah. From the 18 we did accept Murdoch. I was watching an 81 UK goal the other day because I always like to have something, you know, so I can talk to Camfield whenever I meet him. Yeah. And think about how new Mad Murdoch is. Is madness. Is one of those convenient kind of madnesses where he's not like, kind of depressive, where he's trying to kill himself or he's just schizophrenic or he's unreliable. He's just a bit eccentric. Yeah. His madness is largely. I'll do some funny voices. He couldn't have howling slightly off the wall murder, could you? It didn't. It didn't have the edge. But it's just. It's rubbish. It's rubbish. Madness howling. Wacky murder. Yeah, well, that's what he is. He's wacky. Howling, annoying student Murdoch. I think he should have been called. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, the winners. Carl, I think you took some answers. Tim and Neil. Well done, Tim and Neil. Are they going together or are they. No, no, two separate lucky people. Lucky people. Yeah. I don't think your heart's in it anymore either, Carl. I was all right today, but Steve's really dragged me down. Well, let's. I just need to know why. No, do you know, like. Yeah, people are being miserable around you. Yeah, I was when I came in. You gotta remember last week, you were really miserable and that really wound me up. Yeah, because he was down to do stuff because, you know, he'd been let down and they were worried about the next show. Normal mood. Yeah. Look at me, like songs. I wasn't, like, going off and lying on the settee looking ill, talking in that voice. Oh, he's done you again just now. Being quite friendly. Carl. Steve. Carl, have you ever tried to get into the Monarch for free? Because I'll be honest, mate, it's not gonna happen for you. Come out with me, mate. You got a quid off. All right, well, you can get in places in Camden for free. Yeah, I'm all right. Yeah. Oh, yeah, he's done you right. Now it's time for Song for the Lovers. Now, this is one of my favorite songs of all time. You all know this song. Better Done by. That was nearly a sentence. Oh, come on. That was nearly a sentence. What's his name? Glenn Campbell. It's Galveston. Oh, yeah. This is the man who wrote it. This is the original. This is Jimmy Webb. Oh, yeah. With Galveston. If. Michael. Michael. I think it's about a bloke who goes off to the Vietnam War and he's missing is Bird. And I've brought it down, haven't I? Brought it down a tone by saying Bird. It's a beautiful song. It was irony. Just play it. Galveston. It's beautiful. Jimmy Webb with Galveston. Now, I know you enjoy, love, the work of the web meister. A lot of people, of course, be familiar with his sons, the Web brothers. Yeah, yeah. Very different. Quite cool. I went to see him live and he was just so cool. Just, like, doing his songs and telling a little Anna, it was just his. He's fantastic. That's my song for lover Steve. Well, no, I was just gonna mention a couple of other gifts that my father got. Well, he got me once, I unwrapped once, having professed no interest ever in this particular artist. About as much interest as Winston Churchill I once received. Lucky me. The making of Thriller. It was a. It was a video behind the scenes on Thriller. I know what he thinks, though. Steve loves to dance. No, he went. He went. You love music and you love films. Yeah. No, then that's a film. Yeah, Yeah. I mean, I've never professed any interest. I mean, I don't think he even had Thriller, the actual film on it. It was just the making of Thriller, really. Behind the scenes. Michael Jackson dancing around John Landis. Yeah, it was rubbish. That's not very nice, is it? But what did you say when you opened it? Brilliant. Brilliant. I love Jackson. Can't wait to watch this. Can we watch it now? I said, what did he say? No. I'm so ungrateful. Really? Yeah. Because I can't remember a time my dad bought me anything. It's always my mom who bought it and my dad would give her the money. Yeah, you got Ricky, who's lost his go kart. You've had a video about for your. Still not happy. I just think you're selfish. I. It's not so much that I appreciate the fact that there is a gift. I think it's the sort of. It's the fact that the gifts are arbitrary and can be bought in the shop that's opposite the place he works. Tell Carl what you got your mum for this. Listen to this, Carl, you'll love this. It's the thought that counts, right? So I suppose if you say that the thought that counts is the fact that he went and got anything at all that counts. Okay, fair enough. But he phoned me up, he said, what shall I get your mother? Right? It's her 20th wedding anniversary, right? What shall I get her? I said, well, I'll tell you this, this is a great idea. I'd heard from somewhere else. Why not get like a pay for it to have a makeover, you know, and all this sort of treatment, you know, and the beauty treatment. And I sure love that, you know, Then take her out, give her a meal and stuff. He went, okay, okay, okay. So he hangs up. I speak to him on the day of my mum's birthday. I say, what'd you get? What'd you get? He said, I got something. I said, do you go for the makeover idea? He went, not exactly. I went, what'd you do? He went, I bought her a trowel. A trowel? I went, a trowel? He went, yeah, for the garden. I mean, it's a trowel. You've been married 20 years and you got a trowel. He went, it's stainless steel. I said, I said to him, it's a trowel, dad. And he went, do you think I should have got it engraved? It is mental. And I went down to see them, right, and I went in the lounge and literally imagine it like she wasn't this. But imagine I got in there, he'd bought this trowel, right? And he'd also bought her an industrial sized tin of coffee. You know those ones, those big size ones you have in like hotels. She loves coffee, Steve. She loves coffee, Steve. I love the fact that that's meant to be like, like the family news it. Like she keeps that by her bed. Yeah. Like she's in Stalag 13 or something. This is my coffee. Imagine walking into the lounge, right? She's there, she's got the presents. My sister's born, that trowel, just holding a trowel and a tin of coffee and me walking in wondering, I wonder if there's anything sort of that she regrets in her life. Oh, that's lovely. She loves coffee, Steve. She loves coffee, Steve. Oh, she loves the garden. Carl, what's the worst present you've ever had? You see, we don't really celebrate birthdays in our house. So where are you from, planet? Are you? What do you mean you don't celebrate birthdays? Are you here from another world, observing, like, trying to blend in but not quite managing to pull it off? I'm not that fussed about it, right? I mean it's. Yeah, your mum and dads are on the same day and I think that. Just was like, that's a bit weird, isn't it? And they're on anniversary and well, they. Got married on their, their mutual birthday. But Carl, can I just. And Christmas. But Carl, there's a difference between you saying, what do you mean their anniversary. Is on the same day? Course it's on the same day. Yeah, on the birthday. But Carl, what I mean is that you. I mean, you say that you don't really celebrate your birthday, but presumably you have received some presents at some point in your life from your parents or anyone. Yeah. Okay, well, we'll come back to you later. Yeah, thanks. Let's play a Record. I'll have a think about that and we'll come back to you later. Thanks very much, Ash. And sometimes they've won me over. They have indeed. Yeah. They've just got better. They got to be the band they always wanted to be. I'd have written them off in the early days, but. No, me too. Steve, just goes to show Carl, any. Thoughts on what gift you've perhaps once received that you can joke about now? What was tragic at the time? No, no, not really. Put the foot in then. Didn't have that many presents, so. Always thankful for what you got. I was grateful for. Yeah. Rick, would you love to hear from the listeners if maybe they've received some amusing gifts? No. No. So what are you doing tonight? You're going out for a little meal with your parents? Yeah. I thought you were coming. Yeah, right. Yeah, Good to know. Yeah. Any suggestions as to where we could go? I mean, maybe people would like to phone in because I've got no idea. It's got to be largely meat based. I'll only really eat meat. Do you know the steakhouse near me? It's closed down. Brilliant. That's one. There's lots more to go. Let's not stop there. Come on. I used to look across and think, is that a bingo hall or somewhere to eat? Yeah, neon. There's at the back. I had cocktails and, you know, just imagine. Imagine you going in there with a DJ sitting there, hi, gone. Carl's got something. Is there a chance, like, your dad's, like, on the way into London now and has heard you saying, oh, yeah, this, and he got me that. And it could be like nip into a shop now to buy you a rake and thought. Yeah, yeah, just think of that. Oh, that'd be terrible, wouldn't it? Or the Making of the Bends. Yeah. It'll probably turn up and say, I was gonna get you a gift, Steve, but then I got high and we'll all laugh. Yeah. Oh, right, this link has run out of steam again. Yes, but don't worry because I can salvage it. Go on, because it's time for under the Covers. Cover me up. Oh, you got me between the covers. Between the covers. I like covers. Cover songs and was done by someone else. And it was this week. I'd like to play. I mean, we're all fans of Destiny's Child Brick. And we're all fans of the song say My Name. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But if any of us heard the Scottish band Spare Snare doing their version of it, I suspect not. Let's hear it now. Spare Snare doing their version of say My Name by Destiny's Child. R. What do you make of it? Do you remember raw sex that used to be in French and Saunders was roller. R. Yeah. Is that basically what it's like? It's a bit like that. Do you think maybe the COVID version section's running out of steam? That's what we're playing. I think we should only ever do sort of six weeks a year on radio. Right. And then, you know, people are going to remember that. It'll be beautifully preserved in their memories. Yeah. You know, Benny Hill used to do one show a year. Right. You know, I mean, imagine how awful. I mean, if he'd, like, do it every week for two hours. I don't think you'd have been so successful, to be honest, Steve. I think he ran out of ideas. Rick, I know that you are tired of coming in every Saturday and doing the show. I know I am, and I suspect many of the listeners are. But maybe we should leave it to the listeners, you know, if they want us off the air, maybe they should just email, fax, phone numbers. That'd be. I think everything should be like that, though, whether you want to, you know, like a binary sort. Like, you know, up against, someone knocks, like, winner stays on in pool. Yeah, I hate that. Winner stays on in pool in pub. So it's just fascist, innit? You want to play with your mates, you don't have to beat bloke with one tooth who just plays pool all day. Yeah. Cost him nothing. And he has 93 games. Of course you're not going to beat him. He's a professional. By the end of the evening. Okay. XFM 104.9. Merry Christmas. 4 Hero by Les Fleur. Great bloke, Les. Yeah, Work with him in Blackpool. Weird. Very high voice, can't grow a beard. But, yeah, I'm joshing. Probably pronounced. Yeah, we know that. We noticed all those huge posters advertising Christian O'Connell's breakfast show. They're all over the place now. They're mainly on the tube about. You wouldn't know, Gervais. Right. What with your driver and everything. Imagine if they'd spent the kind of money they must have spent on those advertising our show. I know those people were tuning in and today's show is what they heard. I. I was actually thinking, right, because we do sort of. We do care in a way. We couldn't get over it today, you know, just to. Just to word to the kids. This is what alcohol can do to you. Yeah. Sober and. Yeah, it is. Yeah. But I thought, what if this was our first ever attempt to radio? Think how gutted we'd be. We'd go, we're just. This is. We're not. What worries me is it's like. I don't know, it's like in my sort of hangover state, it's like I've kind of woken from a dream and I've sort of thought to myself, all the stuff we're saying today is what we normally say week in, week out, and we think it's brilliant and it's today and it's rubbish and it's like we've seen the truth. Oh, yeah, it might be. See? Yeah. So an alcohol can just not as. Interesting or entertaining as we thought. See, yours could be BSE as well, though, because I know you're worried about that of thing. Yeah. Because you just. You just ate beef, didn't you? For the first 15 years, largely just beef. Yeah. Beef and milk. Mainly uncooked. It was just from the cow. Just. Just suckle it from the cow. Now we're going. We get complaints about that. We will indeed. I always wondered if Bruno Brooks ever got complaints, actually, when he once played Rage against the Machine. Killing in the name of. Yeah. And he must have dozed off or something because he didn't realize all the swearing, you know, f you. I won't do what you told me. And he just left it playing. He probably wasn't. And it was the UK top 40 and it was just, you know. Yeah. Of course, he probably did get complaints. Where is he now? Good point. Doing Internet radio, which is, of course, where we'll be next week. Yeah. If we. If we buck our ideas up. Quick question. Go on. I just realized who Carl looks like. Moby. He does. Not the first person to say. Yeah. I just suddenly just dawned on me then. Yeah. Movie is one of those people that I think is fantastic. Every time I see him, everything he says I agree with, is. Is lovely. And I just can't get into his music. It's bad. It's like. It's like. I feel that. It's like a mate. You can't say, oh, I give it up. Because I think he's. He's fantastic. And I want to go, why don't you do something else? I bored myself then. If you've got a pop star that you'd like Ricky Gervais to pass comment on, why not get in touch. Yeah. What are your views on Rick Witter from Shed 7? Rick Witter? You know, I like their effort. Okay. I think he's quite, you know, got a nice hair. What about Chakrademus and Clients? What was their hit? Tease me, Tease me, Tease Me. Anyway, more of that next time. Oh, that's it. Are we. Are we straight to the song for the ladies now? Yeah, Song for those. Yeah, let's. Should we just get it over with? Yeah, let's knock it this on the. Edge song for the ladies this week, one of the best tracks on Hour of the Bewilder Beast by Bady Drum Boy. It's of course magic in the air for all the ladies. Bye. Sorry about that. We really be. Goodness. Happy birthday or happy birthday to you. But no, we're going to be. We're going to start work on next week's show. Really? From then on it'll be year zero. Yeah.",

They talk about the fact that Steve is 27 today and Carl is 28.\n- Leo Sayer tells XFM 104.9 that he advises the shorter man to wear a short jacket because it's an optical illusion. Then they talk about stripes and the shape of the jacket.\n- Speaker A always looks forward to his father's gifts because they are remarkable. His father bought him the collected Wartime speeches of Sir Winst Churchill.\n- Rick and Bess are talking about the VH1 Top 100 album. They think it's an arbitrary list because it started off with the Doors and then went to Lava Underground and then the biggest thing that year.\n- Speaker B tells the audience that he went to the Monarch last night and got a discount for XFM DJs. He also agreed to DJ there with Ricky Gervais, but he can't remember if he signed something.\n- Rick has been signed up to DJ Yes Club in Canada. He tells the story of how he got in for a quid off by grabbing the doorman off the queue.\n- Jimmy Web and Steve Merchant are talking about their new station XFM 104.9. They are both a little bit hungover because they have been drinking a lot. They talk about their plans for the future.\n- Speaker B tells Complain that he went out last night because it was his birthday. Then he asks why he didn't come out because it's his name all over the show.\n- Rick and Carl are playing a game on the radio. They are trying to come up with dynamite stuff, but they are failing. They think the complete lack of professionalism on their part is unbelievable.\n- Christian is giving away a trip to Salem, Massachusetts to Dwight Schultz, an actor best known for his role in the 80s TV show \"Dwight Schultz\". But they went to the Boris Karloff World of Terror because they were at someone's birthday.\n- Rick and Carl are doing a radio show. Rick wants to have a dig at Carl because Carl has not put a lot of effort in today, but Carl doesn't want to be slagged off. They talk about scary places and the words aren't coming out right.\n- Speaker A wanted a go kart for his birthday. His dad swapped it for a wheelbarrow and he spent the whole time trying to push it up and down the garden.\n- Speaker A tells Dr. Dry that Speaker A has grown into the wheelbarrow and Speaker B is too old to run up and down the garden now.\n- The winners of the competition are tickets for Joe Strummer, the Mescaleros playing at Brixton Academy this evening. They talk about Dwight Schultz and his character Howling Mad Murdoch in the 80s.\n- Carl and Steve talk about the winners and losers of the show. Carl is down because Steve dragged him down. Then Steve asks Carl to come out with him to the Monarch for free.\n- Michael and Jimmy are doing a performance of Song for the Lovers. Jimmy sings the original and Jimmy sings with Galveston. They talk about the work of the web meister.\n- Steve's father bought his mother a video behind the scenes on Thriller for her 20th wedding anniversary. He also bought her an industrial sized tin of coffee.\n- Carl tells Ash they don't celebrate birthdays in his house because his mum and dad are on the same day. Ash asks Carl to think about it and they'll come back to him later.\n- Rick and Speaker B are talking about the gifts they've received. Rick asks the listeners to tell him some amusing gifts, but the listeners don't want to hear.\n- Steve is going out for a meal with his parents tonight. He asks Carl for suggestions about where to go. Carl suggests the steakhouse but it's closed down. They then talk about other places.\n- Rick and Steve are doing their show on XFM. They are doing covers of songs and they think they should only do the show for six weeks a year on radio because it will be beautifully preserved in their memories.\n- Speaker A and Speaker B talk about the complaints that Bruno Brooks received when he played Rage against the Machine.
