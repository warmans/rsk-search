  "text": "Star Sailor and Poor Misguided Fall. With me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington, the K Man. Round of applause for K Man. Yeah, but no one's announced who you are. Ricky Gervais, XFM 104.9 Saturday afternoon. If you didn't know that, I don't know why I mentioned it. That was stupid, really. You must know that by now. We've got some great things coming up we haven't made. We've got songs and chat things. We'll also, of course, be running through the White van man Questions from the sun again, but this time Carl will be answering them. I look forward to that. Yeah. Can we do that fairly soon? Oh, there's some good questions this week. Yeah, we will. But as I was coming in, there was like a bunch of posh lads, I think university students trying to get in because they're doing one of those scavenger hunts that they have to get points for charity and do stuff. And one of theirs is get on a live radio show. Right. So I sort of. Sort of felt sorry for them. So I said they come on here just for five minutes. Who are they? And they're just. Are they toffs? They are sort of like toss, but they're trendy toss. That's obviously trendy toss. I don't want to say. Is that like Lady Victoria Hervey? No, I don't mean that. No. They. They're both sort of like that wheel off Popeye. Right, right, right. Like him, sort of like trendy but posh. They seem nice enough and they're doing it. They're just for a cancer charity and they just get. What is it like? They got their sponsor to do Very. Exactly. I don't know quite how it works, but they're. They're going to come on and come. We get that for coming on this live radio show, they get 17,000 points. Right, good. If I can put that in context. If they were to say to help deliver a baby, they'd only get 7,250 points. But it's much easier. It is. There's lots of women happily dropping sprogs all over the place. You can't get on a live radio show these days for love. No money. That's true enough. You know what I mean? So when are they coming in? Alcal said they're going to 1:30. I had a word with them. Okay, what did you make? They are posh, really. But they said they're gonna wander about and go and see if they can deliver a baby and that. And Then come back here for 1:30 and I don't know if it. I hope they don't like it. Leave a baby sort of half out, you know, if they've, they've got it, you know, they push, push, push. Sorry, we have to shoot off. We've got to go see. We've got to play an instrument in a marching band for 8,500 points. Well, I did say be definitely at 1.30 because I don't want you getting in the way of the white van questions. The other thing is, right, they get 7,500 points for delivering a baby, but they get 9,000 points if they cut Peter Stringfellow's hair. Well, he's, you know, he's very precious about his hair. It's a more delicate operation. There's more that can go wrong. That's true enough. Take an unconventional animal for a walk in a park. What is an unconventional animal? I think that could be a dog that just doesn't play by the rules. Yeah, that's a dog that's into slipknot. Yeah. Wheeze in a urinal. Yeah. Standing up. Exactly. Yeah. Well, I'm looking forward to. Well, yeah, I'm sure they're lovely guys. Luck to you. Yeah, we'll see you later, Nana. Man who Sold the World. Carl's all confused cuz it didn't tell you it was ended, did it? What is that then? Is that a sort of glitch? Looking. Just applause, isn't it? They might start swearing. You know what they're like, rock stars. Yeah. Blue language. Yeah. And all their habits. Yeah. It says track ending now. It's. That's, that's that you're giving away all the secrets of radio and that. People think it's like an old piece of vinyl that we've put on a needle, you know, like those old bits of footage of Tony Blackburn. That's what they think. It's like they don't realize there's computers doing it all. You're showing them behind the curtain. Never do that. I won't. I won't do that. In the week I called Carl up and said, how are you, mate? You? Not too bad. Now, as you know, his girlfriend's been away for ages, hasn't she? Covering the World cup, the African Nations, Nations Cups. She's a sports journalist. Well, yeah, all right. Okay. I love the fact you're thinking, what does that mean, like? Well, she's not much of a journalist, Rick. I've read some of her stuff. No, but she's not on air. She does stuff, you know. Yeah. Behind the scenes. Yeah, sure, sure. A lot of journalists do. You're not going out with K80. That's what you want to make clear, isn't it? Yeah. Now, so she. She'd seen none of the. The meteoric rise of Carl. Right. She's been away for the whole time. A wit. Yeah. A cult figure, to be honest. And he hadn't. He hadn't told her this. So apparently he went home and she was sitting there looking a bit grumpy, went, all right. So, yeah. She went, should we go out? Then he went. She went, I'm not sure I want to go out with an idiot. Oh, no. Yeah, because the incident. Loch Ness Monster. Why don't you just think. Of course the Loch Ness Monster lives in Loch Ness. And she was giving a bit of a hard time. She went, that's why I don't. He said, that's why I. I didn't tell her, you know, I didn't tell her really. Same thing happened when I was at school and I had to play drums in Little Donkey. I didn't tell my parents. Right. But my dad turned up anyway and what happened? How old were you, Carl? Well, it was. It was the school that I used to go to. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you went. Well, you used to go to the school you used to go to. No, but what I mean is, I didn't go to secondary, did I? So I missed a lot of that. Sure. But Primary, I liked O was all coloring in and stuff. Yeah. And it was a Christmas play and I managed to get a part in it. Did you audition? Got a part in it. And I should have been playing the drums to the one about Kings. The three We. Three kings. Yeah. Yeah. I was meant to be doing that, but Little Donkey came on and it was one of them. What do you mean, came on? That was like next up on. On, you know, the. The next song. Right, right. And it's one of them songs that you can't help sort of tapping along to. Yeah. Do you know, like. Like if I. If I was to go. Yeah, you'd have to finish it with. Yeah. Do you know that they actually send that into space? Do they? And what, hoping the aliens will respond with that? Yeah, they do do that because apparently it's. It. It is one of them things that you can't help. You're an alien life form. Yeah. They know that. Do they? But anyway, what could they watch? Dark. Hello. Knock knock. Yeah. No, seriously, if he says no, knock Knock into space. Yeah. They have to say, oggy. Augie. Augie. Ah, that is. That is great. Seriously. Oh, hold on. Was something out there? It's a little green fellow. That is great. Yeah. So anyway, Little Donkey is like one of them tunes that you can't. And I was there and he had the drumstick and I thought, oh, God, the drumstick. I could feel myself. And then just wanted to. I started going along and playing Little Donkey, which I wasn't meant to do, but it went down such a storm. What? Were there people, like parents and that, dozing off, and then suddenly they heard your version of Little Donkey. They thought, wait a minute, now it's really picking up. I'm glad we paid a pound fifty for this. What do you mean it went down such a storm? They're going, hold on. Was it like when in the air, Ringo joined the Beatles now going, boo, Pete Best. But he went, yeah. And I went, whoa. Oh, God. But the teacher just said, oh, it went down really well. You can do that again tonight, right, when you're in it again. But anyway, so my dad was there and. And you hadn't told him about this performance, so he just turned up. I never took the lighters home and stuff. So, yeah, show me Mum and Dad, because it just put me off. So anyway, he turned up. Don't know why. He must have heard from someone else's dad. Yeah, he turned up and he swore about me, which. Did he? I don't. Can you. Could you. Could you use a word? Is it allowed to be said, the word. Course it is. Right. If you. If you got a kid in the car or anything, you can turn it down. Right. But he said there was a guy stood next to him with a camera, big video camera, filming it. And he said, yeah, film it, but try and avoid getting the twat in the hat in the shot. Because I had one of those porters, you know, the little round port pie, hats on. Right. This is so sad. Was this a nativity play? It was about Jesus and stuff. Yeah, well, there was a porter there helping with his bags. There was. I forgot Mary and Joseph, they got there. Yeah, yeah. Because. Because it was the hope, you know, that the inn was full. But I think the porter doubled up with the inn and the stable. Right. That was nice. So he. Yeah, he carry bags over. Yeah, yeah. No, so, yeah, yeah. You're right, though. I don't know why I was wearing one of them, but I was. And. And your father said that. And how did you know your father said that? Did you hear it later. I'll talk about it later. Yeah, I was talking about stuff I'd done at school and he said, oh, God, remember that now? And he. I spoke to him the other day about it. Right. And. Oh, God. So that was. That was the end of your sort of drumming career, really. Because it could have been. I mean, you know, the audience loved it the night before. You could have like, been like. Who knows? A whole new world for you. Yeah. Any stuff. I never drummed. I've never drums. I wish I had, man. But that is. That is a movie story. But is that. And that's why you don't. And you don't tell you still that your mum and dad don't know you on the radio. I think when they were down the other weekend, they had to come in here. I just said, I'll just go in and press the buttons. Because they could listen on Sky Digital, couldn't they? They could do. But you wouldn't want that one. I don't want that. No. I don't want to talk to you again. A little bit about this later. Yeah. Six bucks an hour. Princess Superstar. Bad Babysitter, first played on this show by Steve Merchant. By Bad Steve Merchant. That's true. By. By Steve. Scratch Merchant. I mean, I still like that, but the videos put me off it a little bit because it's just. It makes it into the novelty record it always had the potential of being. I agree. Although I was never a big fan of Babysitter, Bad Babysitter was not my favorite from the album. Sure. If people want my interest in my views on hip hop, then they can always email in. Rick, of course. I'll call you at home. Just give me a ring at home. No problem. Yeah. Or I just pop out and, you know, hang with them. Yeah, sure, sure. Now it's time for White Van Man. White Van man, yes. For those that don't buy the sun. They think it's beneath them. White Van man is a column they have, I think, every day, actually. And they just get sort of some, you know, Joe Public to kind of comment on week's news. Just seem to me, you know, that it might be interesting to. To get Carl's views. Yeah. On some of the big events. Not because we think that Carl hasn't got a valid sort of viewpoint. No, because Carl sees the world differently to some people, that's all. That's. That's what's interesting. You know, like an artist does or. Exactly. Yeah. He's very bohemian in his outlook. Yeah. Do you do you feel that you're up to scratch on this week's news? I don't like this. But don't. You don't. Just relax. Why not? It's pressure. No, no, because you just have to. Give us your first opinion for your honest answer. That's all we've ever asked of you, Carl. It's all you've ever given us. You're honest. You're first from the heart view. Yeah. Don't worry. Just relax. Are you worried that people are listening and thinking you're an idiot? If my girlfriend's listening. Now go and have a wash or something. Go and have a wash. Not very nice, is it? Is it the opposite of Napoleon and Josephine? Yeah, go on. Go on. If you're gonna visit me again, Josephine, for Christ's sake. 1. I'll ease you in with something fairly easy. A music based question. Kylie Minogue versus Dido as Queen of the Brits. What's your view then? Go and have a wash. It doesn't really matter, does it? What does it really matter with the Brits? I was watching it the other night and I think Kylie will be a good looking old woman. Do you know? Do you ever. Do I want to. Steve, I want to celebrate with you. Every time he opens his mind, I want us to open a bottle of champagne. I know what you mean. Do you know what I mean? It's like we did that. Yes. No, look at people. And another person who springs to mind, Jenny Powell. I don't think she's that good looking now. Who's Jenny Powell? Is she that girl that used to be the assistant on Wheel of Fortune? Yeah. I think she's a bit over the top for a young woman, but when she gets older I think she'll look. Be a bit of a stunner. So for you, Kylie, whereas you don't feel that about Dido, is that right? She's all right. She's normal. I prefer Kylie's sister to Kylie. You know, I could imagine her being at hard work to live with. And who Kylie not being washing up and that. Right, sure. Okay. And what do you make of taxes rising in the next budget to pay for NHS improvements? Well, my dad went to hospital to have an operation once. Yeah. So I feel like it's worth paying it because I've got some. Because people. Because people might go. Have to go to hospital. Yeah. Yeah. But it makes a change when it's someone in your family, doesn't it? Yeah, because you sort of realize, yeah. It changed as good as the rest. And the weird thing is, if it weren't for me dad, I wouldn't be here doing this show. Because when he was in hospital. Well, no, I'll stop you there. Yeah. To be honest, that's all you need to know. You wouldn't be here, too. But no, but, no, no, because this was after I was born, so I wouldn't be here. But his more direct involvement was what? Yeah, because when. When my mum was seeing me dad in the hospital, I got a bit bored, went for a wander, found the hospital radio station. Yeah. And got a gig, really. So in arena real sense, if it wasn't for Carl's dad, Carl wouldn't be here. And did your dad, like, while he was listening to you, did he, like, sort of tap the nurse and go, can you get that twat off the air? Who's put him in that? Yeah. Okay. What do you make of the real life Mowgli, who's surviving in a Transylvanian countryside? Apparently, I don't know much about this story. I don't. You know Mowgli, he's the guy. He's the Jungle Book. Yeah. A little kid that grew up with bears and animals and stuff. Apparently there's a real life one in Transylvania. What were the things in Gremlins? What were the what like in Gremlins? They were. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, this is an example. This is what your girlfriend said. Think what were the things in Gremlins called? I can't remember. Just. I mean, really, it's nothing like that. Isn't it? No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Just really, really think now, Carl. Just with all. With everything you've ever. With all the brain power you've ever used, think what the things in Gremlins were called. It's not there. There's a clue here. Oh, no. Yeah. They're not. What? Gremlins. Yeah. Play a record, Carl. This is xfm. Well, we're back. And there's a few more people here. It's absolutely well done. Yeah. Well observed. Yeah. Do you want to say hello? Hi, guys. And what are you doing here? This is Mark and James or Sco and Belch. And we're here. Sorry, your names are what? Sorry, Say the last bit again or what? Scoe and Belch. Scoe and Belch. Yeah, that's right. Do you want to explain that? No, no. From the drinking games, I imagine. Yeah. Got worse names than that. But it's radio soon now. You're presumably students. We've just. Well, we kind of graduated. We've been in work like about a year or two. And what do you do? I work for a management consultancy. I work for a distribution company up in Birmingham. Okay. Now what you're doing is a scavenger hunt and you're raising for cancer charity research. Right. And you've got to do. And this is. We're just help me out here. Because for 17,000 points, you have to get live on a TV or radio show. That's exactly it. Here we are. That's why we're here. Yeah. Do you ever listen to xfm? I know of it, yeah. I've. I listened to it a few times, sure. What kind of music, what kind of sounds would you normally be into? I love cheesy radio. Sort of school disco, sort of, you know, 80s stuff. Sure. Sorry, what was your name again? Mark or Sco. Sco. And you're Belch. Belch. And what sort of sounds would you be grooving to? Belt. UK Garage. Craig David. A bit of house, just very occasionally. A bit of cheese. It depends what kind of mood I'm in, you know. Now, you don't listen much, but you. I mean, kiss a celeb because. Carl. Yeah. We actually wanted to do that with you, Ricky. Is that right? No, that's not gonna happen with Ricky. But, you know, Carl's now got his name mentioned in Heat magazine. Is that right? Well, that's brilliant. If you want to snork Carl, we'd love to see that. I mean, we don't want to snog Carl, but I mean, we were thinking if there was kind of a female presenter here, we might be able to do something. But what are you saying? A female placenta? Well, if you've got one. Have you seen some of the female placentas that work on xfm? Oh, presenter. Is that why they're on radio? I thought it said placenta. That's unlikely. I know. What's the other things you've got to do here? So what are some of the things you've done already? Well, somebody's worrying me. Like start a fire in Pudding Lane. Oh, we've done that already for 4,005, 700 points. Well, I'll tell you what we have done. We've been on Phantom of the Opera stage already. Have you? Yeah, we just asked the stage door guy. That wasn't during the show, actually. No, and that's right. We also. He actually mentioned that. Yeah, we shouldn't speak about that too, otherwise he'll get. But yeah, he was really kind. Let us on. We've Jumped in Trafalgar Square water with doing a sort of friends impersonation. So that was. Right. How many points for that? We got 2,000 points for that. We got 8,000 points for being on the stage at Phantom of the Opera and we get double that. We get like 18,000 points, which is almost the maximum for being here right now, really. Obviously I wouldn't worry about the little things. I'd go for the biggest. Yeah, that's it. We're not. We're not interested in little stuff. Want to go for the big stuff? Yeah. So what were the big ones are? Get on stage with S Club 7. That's not gonna happen, is it? What have you got till till six today? Well, S Club 7 are on at the London arena at about 2 o'clock, so good luck. I think it's gonna be very, very difficult on there, but I think so. Yeah. Get in the vaults of a bank. Yeah. Some of these are bordering on the illegal. That's 20,000 points. Like get in a cage at London Zoo. Don't do that. I mean just 10,000 points. But don't do it. Unless it's a penguin cage. We were hoping just some kind of timid animal we might be alright with. Yeah, sure. If anyone's got any good ideas for sort of funky things to do on air then. Okay, well if you leave your number and anyone calls in, they can help you with anything. Well, maybe, maybe it's my best club's head listening. We love them to be. If they are, it is for charity and the points get awarded into money for colon cancer research. So it'd be absolutely fantastic if we could. Yeah, so Bradley, John, Tina, if you're listening. Yeah, if you're listening or any celebrity out there who's a female celebrity, we need to. We need to snog them if we can. This is good for 7,000 points. This looks like a good one. Play the organ in a church. That must be easy. Is that a metaphor? Yeah, but you know, it says the. Bigger the better, so it might be. That's got to be euphemism. Yeah, it's got to be, hasn't it? Yeah. Well, thanks very much. Good luck, guys. Guys, thank you very much. Standing outside Les Mis looking miz. That's going to happen. That's good, man. A big gun type thing on the HMS Belfast. That won't. Well, we've got a big gun. It's just finding the boat which is the problem. Oh, calm down. What was your name? Bo Po. Thanks very much. Cheers, guys. Cheers. Bye the streets. Let's push things forward on XFM 104.9, the Home of Charity. That's true enough. Yeah, I've got to slow down cuz I'm doing a little bit too much for charity. I've got a. I got to worry about myself sooner or later. Do you know what I mean? No. Come on. We're halfway through White Van Man. We were indeed. Yes. These lads came in getting Carl's views on some of the big stories of the week from the news. Carl, what do you make of the fact that the British Olympic curling team won a gold medal? I watched it, I thought it was really good. The only thing that's getting on my nerves now is like. What was that? Is that a trombone? Oh, it was me moving this microphone. Right. Incredible, wasn't it? Yeah. What an amazing noise. The only thing is that shouldn't sound. Like that, should it? That's incredible. What a shoddy Tim pot station this is. Well, we know that. Sorry, Carl, go on. It's like in all the papers now in like the, you know, the Star and the sun. All week they've been like traipsing models over a bit of granite. Do you know like how those things are made out of granite? The, the things they throw? Oh yeah. And it just. That that bit annoys me. Okay. The Daily Star. No, the way that you know this sport, nobody had ever sort of heard of it a couple of weeks ago. Yeah, yeah, sure. We win a gold medal. Yeah. And now in the papers, it's like they've gone crazy. They've gone curling mad. Yeah. Good game though. Yeah, good. Okay, next. Alright, good. Let me see, let me see, let me see. What about the fact that the world's tallest man is living in a semi in eastern? It's alright, isn't it? Something that someone told me in the week is that do you know all these tall people? Like this guy? Yeah. Which is a bit weird. They've only just found him considering he's the tallest man. That's a bit weird. Yeah, yeah. Someone told me that. Do you know the guy who was in James Bond? The big bloke? Yes. Jaws. Jaws. He's got the same illness as this bloke. Right. And what it is, it's called tall. It's something about. You're suffering from tall. You've got a small tumor or something just behind this part of your head. Yes. Oh yeah. Just sort of in the middle of your eyes. Yeah. And the pressure on that makes you grow really tall or something. Yeah. So he needs to get it sorted. That's your advice to him, get it sorted? Okay. Very. Finally, Carl, this is important. This is just projecting into the future. Just projecting into the future. Now, Cayman, apparently global warming will bring sizzling summers and weird wildlife to Great Britain in the future. Are you worried about that? How soon? Soon enough for you to worry. Yeah, it's pretty worrying. Okay. You don't. You wouldn't prefer it to be sunny here all the time? No, because with hot weather comes with spiders and that. See, I always think we're quite lucky here. Yeah. If you live in Australia, you might have the sun and stuff, but you've got like deadly snakes. Yes. Which are deaf. Did you know snakes are deaf? Snakes are deaf. They don't have ears. Okay. So you're all right walking about behind them. Yep. But if they see you ahead of you, you're in trouble. But yeah, with places like Australia, you know, people go, it's great, it's sunny. But they don't talk about the spiders. And they keep the spiders and stuff. So I think we've got a bit of both. The best world. So you're worried, though, about in the future, the vultures flying through the sky. We got various creepy crawly snakes. You concerned about that? Yeah. Well, there's a load. I saw something in the news in the week that a load of sparrows or something was somewhere. Maybe that's the start. That's an interesting story. Was that from Pedro? There's a load of sparrows somewhere. Read all about it. Sparrow somewhere. Sparrow somewhere. Load of sparrows somewhere. Sparrow somewhere. There you go. Anyway, excellent. That's. That's. That's Carl giving his views on the news. Don't do that next week. Why not? I just don't like it. Why? Pressure. It's not pressure. You did brilliantly. Lost profits there on XFM 104.9 now. I like that. It rocks. I like the guitar atmosphere. It's good. But it's called the Fake Sound of Progress. No, I know. See, what always annoys me is when people, they dismiss, you know, say, Enrique Iglesias, current number one. Great song, good video, brilliant video. And they say, oh, it's rubbish and all that. But I think that songs with titles like A Fake Sign of Progress. Yeah, Much more something to get on your hobby horse about what has happened in that. Lyrics by good artists is always worse than that. Or if you work for the record company or you worked on that video because he's got the money and the girl and then Mickey Rourke beats him up, right? He has a fight. You just see him knock him over. And then it cuts the next scene. It's night. It's not in the desert. There's loads of police cars. They're not doing anything. They're just standing there somehow. He's probably eating donuts. He's dying of injuries. But I don't know what happened. They don't. What has happened in that video? I think if you heard the 12 inch mix, there's a whole bunch of other sequences that explain why. Yeah, I mean, we're all thinking. Also, we think that he stole the girl off. I think he stole the girl off Mickey Rourke as well as some money. Some money. Mickey's tracked him down. Yeah. And he's thinking, I'm gonna stop running. I'm gonna face Mickey this time. He does. And then boom. You're right, it cuts and suddenly the police have shot him or something. I don't know where they are. Don't know. The police seem to be leaving him to die. I thought. I thought that they'd called the police because the. The sort of like the melee. But Mickey walks off with his gang. The police are going, well, you know, where are. There's no evidence. They go, well, look, he's dying. They're going, but how did he die? How is he dying? He's not. He's a bit wet for the moment. Knowing rock, though, Rick, I imagine he's stitched Enrique up, all right. He's framed him or something. Or. Or he's. He's no. Sort of like ninja stuff. And there's lots of internal injuries that aren't immediately. Anyone. If you were involved with perhaps the making of that video, or. Indeed you are. Enrique Iglesias. Give us a ring if you're around. Come on, just. Just fill us in. I don't need. I'd. I'd rather play some adverts now. I'd love to play some adverts, right? But I'll say this. I'd also like to tell the listeners that coming very soon on xfm, some huge news about Carl that will rock Pop Idol. It's gonna be an ongoing saga shot. Good track, good band. But I'll tell you what, in the second hour, I just want to play classics. I'd love to be able to. I want to play some Cure, New Order Smith. Sure. Do you know what I mean? Some. You know, we played Nirvana earlier, but it's not enough for me. Steve. No. You need your fix. I do. Well, it's that point in the show now, Song for the Lovers. One of my favorite singers. What? Probably one of the most beautiful singer songwriters of all time. Well, you don't mean that like. You don't mean he's a good looking bloke and you fancy him. I mean, I just want to kill that Rick, because otherwise that would. Yeah. What you mean is that the songs he writes are beautiful. Yeah. You can take or leave him as a bloke. Yeah. And I've got. I've got. And he's written. He's written such brilliant classics with his lovely ass as. People listen and misinterpret. Oh God. He wrote Galveston, he wrote Wichita lineman, MacArthur Park. And just to tickle him down below. What? What? I don't know what Steve's. And this is a song, one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. It's often I feel 10 easy pieces, which is just him doing the versions of other, you know, that he gave to other people on piano. And this is called if these Old Walls Could Speak. And it is absolutely beautiful. Listen to this. If these Old Walls Could Speak by Jimmy Webb. Might play another track off that later if we got time. What, today? Yeah, well, maybe, or maybe next week. We've got lots to pack in. We've got things like New Order, Cure. Oh, I'm just hoping that all those kind of new metal fans, Rick, can just calm down for a second, you know. Yeah. And just enjoy that for what it was. Yeah. I hope they're snobbery is not going to prevent them from enjoying. They can just leave it alone for two hours for our show. Exactly. We try and, you know, we get. Try and pack lots of talking about new metal. Can I just say, Ian Camfield is here tonight. He's moving from Fridays. Right. What the hell does he think he's doing? He's just offering up information now. No, it's just like you were talking about the new metal's and now seems like a good time. No, listen, you're here for our amusement. Yeah. You don't. You don't sort of come in anytime you want. When we decide it's time to sort of have some fun at your expense, then we'll let you know. But otherwise this is. We're not here to help other DJs or even this station. We don't give a fuck about this. See, this is what my girlfriend said. What's that? Well, you should listen to her. She knows what she's talking about. Clearly. Now put your microphone down. She said they just wheel you out when they need you. Switch your microphone off, Carl, and let us finish what we were saying. Right, just what were you saying? Ian Canfield has got a rock show. Oh, right, yeah. Starting today, four hours of pure Rock. Yeah, he's probably here, smoking, drinking Jack Daniels and just like having pictures of Vance put up around him to get in the mood. Then it go out and rock. Carl, don't be silly. Turn your microphone on. We're joking. It was. It was. Is that right? When's he on? Eight till twelve tonight. Four hours of rock. Lovely. Listen, some big classics coming up, plus huge news about. No, please, let's play some more ads. Do you really want some ads? I'm tired of the music and chat. Please play some more ads, Carl, please. Sake cure on XFM104.4.9. That's what it's all about, Steve. Absolutely. Classics. Yeah, we've got some more classics coming up. Looking forward to them. Now, when we were talking to Kyle in the week, things were talking to Carl is that you come up with something that's sort of like quite innocent. And he goes, ah, well, once, right. And you realize that it's comedy dynamite. He doesn't know it, but we want to go save it. And he let out. You were filling in a form, weren't you? It was all like your girlfriend thinking you're a div. And it's that before, isn't it? Because she came home and you'd filled out a form to get a job once, hadn't you? Yeah. What was that for? Granada Telly and on it. Well, let Carl explain. Yeah. You see, this is what annoys me with job applications, because rather than just saying, do you want the job? And what can you bring to this business? Yeah, do you want the job? Is a good one. Because the thing is that sort of the name for the boys. No, listen. Right, because if they say no, I don't think they want the job. Yeah, but listen, go on. I mean, I presume with what you do, you have to take people on and stuff. Fight, you mean. You know what I mean. Yeah. And I think it's more important that you're willing to graft and put the hours in. Sure. Than say that, you know, you did well at school. Yes, sure. Because if I wanted to, I could have done well at school, of course. I just. I just didn't want to. So where's this going? So you had the application form. So when it came to the qualifications bit and that, I couldn't fill them in because I didn't have Any qualifications? And it was also asking about your languages. And I put down English. Quite good. English. Quite good. And his girlfriend came over and seen the form that he'd sent off. This was a copy of it. And so she went, oh, you know what I mean? So that's what started, you know, the disappointment. So they're gonna get that and think that you're not English. I don't think I've got it. It was ages ago. Right. How long ago was it? Oh, well, it was when I was still in Manchester, so five years ago. I don't think you want to know. No, I think that could be a long list. I mean, there's probably a lot of admin problems in that organization, but they probably. But what I meant by it is that mean that, you know, I can speak English, but I don't know all these long words that people use all the time. Yeah. Oh, God. Oh. Can I just tell this quickly? In the week. I'm talking to you now, the listener. Usually I don't. Yeah. Carl said, oh, about embarrassing him on air and that. And he's worried about his education and he was worried about not knowing long words. Like, we come up with any long words. And he said, no, I was always scared you were going to ask me some about someone. And he's a Eastern European leader. His surname is Milosevic. And Carl said, so I learned it this week and learned it so you can't catch me out in case you say, I said, what? And he said he thought about it. He went flobber down. Milosevic got a surname right, though, didn't it? So what's his name? What's his name? That's how Bill and Ben would address this leader. How would they have said it? Flobble Dam a lot of what's his name? Slobber Dan. Yeah. Yeah. Well done. Anyway, Carl, look, you almost let it slip then as you were talking about your filling out that application form. There's some big news that everyone needs to know, which we were stunned by in the week. Although the more we sort of talk to you, the more it starts to fall into place. Yeah, but Carl, what's the story that. I haven't got me my exam results from the GCSEs? He never turned up to get his exam results working. And so how many did you take in the end? Because you weren't even sure about that worry. You think you took maths and English, don't you? Yeah. And you think you've handed in the. Artwork for art now, art was continual Assessment, wasn't it? Coursework. And what was it that you had, you made. I made a man sort of putting his arms into a car. You made a model of a man putting his arms into a car. What was this? So that one's passed homage to break ins in Manchester was this. Oh, look, he does what he sees. Yeah. So that's safe. You definitely got that one. So you've taken art, you've taken English and maths. You think so this is what we're gonna do, listeners. We're gonna try and find out his exam results for him and tell him next week we're gonna call his school, we're gonna try and track him down and we are gonna have a little envelope and we are gonna give Carl, at the age of 29, his O level results. GCSEs. Yeah. Now, Carl, so you took maths, you think you took English. Do you remember turning up to do those? Do you remember sitting in the room filling in the forms? Yeah. Okay. And how did you feel? You did? I didn't. I don't think I did well. You don't think you did well, did you revise? No. Why didn't you revise? Because I don't really believe in it. Okay. Well, it's just that if you don't know it, then you don't know it. You shouldn't have to start looking at the book. If I went to the doc, if I went to like the hospital. Yeah. And the doctor said, oh, you need your appendix out. But I'm gonna minute. I've just gotta read up on it. Yeah, that isn't good enough. Okay. He should know. And that's, that's the way I feel about it. To be fair, though, he did do the revision beforehand. Yeah. They don't usually pass on like maybe like when they're in practice. Yeah. Information. They took him by osmosis. Yeah, yeah. Bloke comes and he goes, can I just see what you did with that? You've passed. Yeah. Phew. Yeah. Good job. I watch casualty. I just like the way, you know, the things that interest me. I remember things like snakes not having ears and stuff. I didn't have to read about that. No, you just looked that. You saw it on the teddy you saw on that Ian Wright program. Yeah, yeah. And this is what Carl said to me. He said, only, no, it's actually, I'll call Carla in the week. And Reese was with him. You know, Reese used to be on xfm. And he took the phone and he went, Carl's worried I've seen that program. He said, snakes don't have ears, right? He said, so you can creep up on them and pick them up. And he said, carl's worried. He said, how would you ever put them down again? Because then they know that you're there. I woke up the other night quite late, worried about that, and I said to my girlfriend, I said, how do you put a snake down? She said, what are you talking about? I said, that Ian Wright thing. This guy managed to pick up a snake and you know that thing where they clamp his head on a jar to get the poison out? I do now. Right. They did that, but they didn't show you how they got rid of it. And I thought it could really get nasty because it's obviously annoyed that you've had its head pressed in the jar. Yeah, right. They hate that now, especially as it's in front of their mates when you lift it off. Yeah. Right. You've got hold of it. Yeah. If you go to chuck it down, it's gonna turn on you. It's gonna get wild, isn't it? So I just wondered. Well, what you do is you never put it down, Carl. Yeah, that's why. That's why that bloke has got about 11 or 12 just carrying him. Exactly, yeah. You never put down. You sling it. Who cares? You just throw it, don't you? Really far. That's not that I don't think you should throw snakes, but. Carl, listen, don't worry. We're not asking you to get involved with snakes. We're just asking you. Now, you did. You've done maths, you think y did no revision for that? No. Okay, English. Do you remember what it was? Did they ask you about Shakespeare? Did they ask you about books? I remember, but I must have done it because I thought that was. It was English language, not English literature, wasn't it? So it was like spelling and more. So was it? No. Was it. Was it like a comprehension? You read a passage now to ask questions on it. Was it. Did you have to write a short essay? I don't know. I can't remember any of that. Okay, I did. I did a science. Okay. Physics or chemistry? Physics. All right. Well done. And this is all you think. And you actually took that. You actually took physics, GCSE thing. You're obliged to do a language, I think. Did you do French? I did French for a bit. I don't think you are. I don't think you have to do a language. I think you have at gcse I think you've got to. Well, English quite good. I think that's his language he did. So you don't know about language, history, geography. Just what you will find out, won't we? Okay. But you just can't remember. I can't believe you can't remember turning up for these things because it's quite a big moment in people's lives. It is the thing that you've been working to all of your educational life. On the day that the things came out, I was working at a printer. Print. As a printer. Okay. And it was a really busy. A lot of spelling mistakes. It was a really bad day. So you're bound to forget. Yeah, yeah. No, but I. I had to use gold ink that day. I mean, you got a printer, so you don't. You don't know. No, that's the biggie in it. But it's tough. You've got to really get your rollers clean. Carl. Play a record, mate. And good luck with the exam results. Hopefully we'll have them for you by next week. PJ Harvey on XFM 104.9. The home of the classics. Absolutely. Six classics. Classics, classics, classics. Well, we were talking earlier about this as this book, they Died Young. And there's all these theories about these people, like famous people that aren't really dead. And I remember speaking to someone about this, okay? And they said to me, bruce Lee is not dead. I said, he's not dead, right? And I said, well, how do you know he's going. No, it was a whole big thing by the Hong Kong government and he's actually working as an undercover cop in Hong Kong using his. His kung fu powers now. No, he's. Apparently he faked his own death, Carl, so that he could work undercover for the Hong Kong police, infiltrating gangs, the triads, that sort of thing. Now my point is this. If you're going to use someone undercover in Hong Kong, right, you know, undercover cop, I suggest using the most famous Chinaman of all time. That. That would be guaranteed. Yeah, yeah. So, you know, when he's taking away a gang, they're going, you look a bit like Bruce Lee. He's going, no, no. I don't know. See this, this mustache? It was a bit wonky. Well, it's. I just. Just take my word for it. I'm not Bruce Lee. All right? Well, all that stuff he did when you punching us and kicking us and chop. Yes, but co. I'm not. It does look a bit like the stuff in my film in in his films. In his films, yeah, but it's, it's. Not, it does not just coincidence. No. Yeah. The thing is though, I'm not sounding bad here, not trying to offend anyone, but they do all look. They do all look. No, no, no. I don't know, you know, we're having a serious chat, right? I'm not, you know, I'm not here to upset anyone. Why. And what I'm saying is over here. I'm so sorry, I'm not. Yeah, but you know me, I'm not, I'm not out to upset one. Right? You're not a racialist. No. What do you mean? Are you saying oriented people all look alike? Well, look at the people over here, right? Yeah. You've got ginger people, you got people with black hair, you've got people who are fat, people who are thin, but they're all so sort of fit, which isn't a bad thing. They all do that sort of thing in the park. They're all fit. It's a place where black hair. I mean, when they come here, they take pictures of people with ginger hair, don't they? Because they don't get them over there. That's what I'm saying. So calm down. So you're saying that Bruce Lee, the most famous Chinese movie star of all. Time, they can't tell him apart. Other tribe members would. How are they. I mean, how are they going about their business core? I mean, what I'm saying is how would they even realize. Yeah, that was a guy. What do they have to do? Wear numbers in, you know, because there's, there's, there's a billion. No, but when you know them, then you know, so. Oh, I see. They can tell each other apart, can they? Well, they got signals. I. This is amazing. Is it? Sorry. Got away with Simon. Simon. Which one are you? Just raise your hand. Chang. Which one's Chang? Chang. Good. Yeah. Oh, it must be murder, mustn't it? Just people going into the wrong houses all the time, getting off with their mates, wives. Yeah, it must be a nightmare. Please don't complain. He doesn't know what he's doing, so I'm really sorry to anyone. He honestly does not know what he's saying. Xfm 104.9. Yeah, but what I'm saying is. Go on. I don't think I am offending anyone. Okay, fine. That's alright then. And you know that I wouldn't want to do that. No, I know you don't want to. Swore radio. I said right, if you Got kids in the car, Turn your radio. So before you make any potentially racist remarks, just point out if you are listening and you might be oriental, please don't take offence or go. You know what I mean? Come on, then. So what was this? Other dead person. Can't play a record. Ricky's having a heart attack. We'll come back. The music of tomorrow is here. Xfm. Well, the music of tomorrow is here. That's true enough. Yeah. There's been some sort of muck up with the post, Rick. A lot of the times when I've played hip hop. Hooray. My hip hop track of the week. Yeah, you've sort of scoffed. You've thought that maybe I don't have credibility amongst the hip hop fraternity. No, it's just the way you dance. Well, it's merely the way you dance that worries me because people can't see it, really. And it's sort of like, imagine if Mr. Bean thought he was in D12, you know, I mean, it's. It's that sort of. And I don't diss you. I mean, I know you're, you're. You're a hip hop appreciator, you know. I wouldn't expect you to diss me. I'm a black queen. But the point is that I just. There's a little something that Carl's got on tape for you that I think might change your opinion of my whole hip hop credibility. Now, I've told you in the past. Video type, is it? Not at all. Not all. Carl, just play it. Just play. Yo, 1, 2, 1, 2. We are the Dilated Peoples chilling on Hip Hop Parade. That's right, with Steve Merchant, y'all. XFM 104.9, LA to London. Dilated people expanding them all day. Now, who got that car? That was just when I was hanging out with my homies. No. Do they come in in the week? They were in the week, I think, and somebody got them to do it. For them, you know. No, that was when I was just. I was just hanging in the crib with them. No, no, no, no. Guys just put. Just laid down some beats for me. Yeah, just let down some vocals and I gave him max respect for it, you know. The place was mad deep with girls at the time. I assume you're gonna play donated peoples this week. Well, maybe. Yeah. Let's play it. Car. That's very good. Respect, guys. Cheers very much. Out of here. Yeah, guys, just max in there. Definitely. Good to hear from them. Good to hear from the boys. I'll probably be heading over to la. NYPD and just, just, you know, chilling with them. I'd love them to meet you. You're having a laugh though. I'd love them to meet you. We would hang out. I know all the Giants. It's that thing they do on MTV or H. We're like being dilated peoples and they come and they make us three look like a rap group. Wouldn't that be great? Listen, I told you before, I've always remembered the words of. Of Snoop Doggy Dog. Yeah, bitches a bitch and a hose a hoe. But if a man be acting like a. He's a bitch ass homie. Those are the words from the street. I would be like you two had won a competition or something. Do you know what I mean? Like, I just don't think you can. You can believe it that I'd just be hanging out, you know, in the crib. People of courage. And you get a chance to meet your favorite. It'd be amazing, wouldn't it? Listen, we were talking earlier about the fact that Bruce Lee, and it's a well known fact. Yeah. He faked his own death so he could continue his undercover police work as opposed to being. Because no one would point to anyone else. I was talking to someone as well recently who utterly convinced. And you get this quite a lot, don't you? Especially Americans that Elvis Presley's still alive. Yeah. And I think. Wasn't there some statistic like more people believed Elvis was alive than thought than believed. Evolution? Was that right? Yes. No, no, no, no, no. It's something worse than that. It's. It could be something. It was something like that. Something like, I don't know, it's something like 42% of Americans believe that Elvis Presley has faked his own death and is still alive. Right. Yeah. And there's this whole book that's been written about it because Carl, you might be interested in this. I know you're always fascinated by things that have been written down and therefore a gospel. Yeah. And. And you have to revise yourself. You just learn off Ian Wright. Yeah. Apparently the reason that Elvis is still alive is that there's a number of sort of pieces of evidence. One is that none of his family could agree which color pajamas he was wearing when he died. That's evidence. Apparently. Apparently. You know, he was an honorary member of the FBI. Well, apparently his signature appears on FBI documents well into the 80s long after he should have died. Apparently no one can agree there was sums of money. Yeah. A lot of fat People in dungarees have seen him. Yeah, there's a number of sums of money which apparently only he could have given authority to have transferred to other bank accounts. They've moved. So this is all evidence that Elvis is still alive. And a lot of people understood this guy. He was saying, well, of course the thing is the pressures of fame were too much for him. That he faked his own death so that he no longer had to be this huge icon, you know, he could live an ordinary life. And my query has always been this. If Elvis faked his own death, do you think the method he'd have chosen is to have shat himself to death whilst on the toilet? Yeah, yeah. But because he picked that, nobody will doubt it. Right? So Elvis went to the FBI. Yeah. What do you mean exactly? So what we're saying, Carl, is that there was lots of methods open to him. You know what I mean? It's all. He didn't go to his. His secret police and go, oh, I'm afraid I wanna. I want to fake my own death. I mean. And I go, yeah, yeah, what methods have you got? I like to be found myself down the toilet. You like to do what? I want a big fat mother on the toilet just shitting myself to death. Obviously it's a good idea. I'm just wondering if there's maybe something a little bit more glamorous for your favorites. I mean, you could take a bullet for the president. One all over him just. No, no, no, we know crap at all. No, you just. You just take a bullet for more. You could. There has to be involved. Why has it got to be as machine rule? Why is it coffee? Crap. I want this way. Make it happen. Yeah, it's probably Carl. Head in hand. Yeah, he's worried about the things we say. Yeah. Jeez, we haven't offended 1.2 billion people. Yeah, a fifth of the planet. So Carl, what do you make of it then? Do you. Are you convinced Elvis is still alive? Am I getting mixed up with someone else? Because all Elvis, all Elvis's look alike? Because that is true. A lot of Elvises do look alike. That's safe on his gravestone. Didn't they get his name wrong? Or is that his brother? Who's his brother? Aaron. That's his middle name. You're not an Elvis kind of expert, are you? Hold on. Was Elvis. Was that wasn't Elvis one of a twin that died? That died. And I'm sure they got his name wrong on a grave or something, I don't know. But that's so that's consequently, that's proof he's still alive. The thing with the still alive thing, like I say, he picked that awkward death because nobody would be saying, hang on a minute, going around upsetting the family, wanting to talk about it, because they'd be embarrassed to be saying, you know, it was found sort of. Yeah. In a pile of mess weighing 25 stone. Yeah. So. Because you notice he also expanded to a huge size as well. So he was just a huge fat blob of a man. He also did that to add, you know, extra. I don't quite understand all this, these people who fake the deaths, because. Well, a lot of them don't. A lot of them don't. Carl. This is what. This is what, in a roundabout way, we're saying. We're saying that a lot of people that say people think that they didn't like Bruce Lee and James Dean and Elvis Presley, we're saying they didn't. He did die, didn't he? His head come off, didn't he? Who's this James Dean? His head came off. There is a line. The number goes out. The Smiths, XFM 104.9. Nearly through. Absolutely. Two hours of chat. Great music. Bloody good music. Carl, of course, speaking before he thinks. By the way, you know, when he was going about Mowgli, you know, he's going to talk about Mowgli and you said, what are the gremlins called? Yeah. Were you thinking of, ah, Makwa? Yeah, but they still. They were called Gremlins. Yeah, yeah, I know what you're thinking. I know, to be fair. But my girlfriend won't be listening now, so she'll still think I'm a bit daft. Why? Why would she ever think that? How long have you going out with her? About eight years. Well, then, why would she ever think you're daft? That's the only stupid thing you've ever said of the Mogwai thing. Why would she ever think she's going out with a. To be honest, a retard, I think. I think it's very beautiful relationship you must have, you know, because it's odd, like, I mean, she's a professional journalist or whatever. Yeah. You know, and she works for. Is it Radio 5 or something? BBC Sport. BBC Sport. Quite good, is it? His English? Quite good, huh? Really good. Yeah. So. And did she do her exams? Yeah, she's quite bright. Sure. So what do you bring to the relationship? I think take the pressure off her. Take the pressure off her to do what? You know, like when she's had a stressful day and she comes home, talks. To me, I think, yeah, you would relax me. And that's the truth, honestly. But you know, Carl, you can just. He can just go, wow, it's all right. You know what I mean? He doesn't. You don't get stressed. He sits in his little booth now. He doesn't talk to anyone. His little sound booth all the week. And you just. You're in your own little world, aren't you? But it's interesting because I wonder sometimes what your aspirations are. I was thinking this. I was watching a repeat of Family fortunes on Challenge TV last night and it was sort of mid-80s one. And I don't know if it's still the case, but it was the aspirations of the contestants. So kind of it was like. And what's your hobby? Well, you know, like to go out when it's nice weather and stay in. Well, if not, if you win £2,000, you'd probably be going out when it's nice. Couldn't you? Yeah. And she was like, well, and I, you know, I. I sometimes like to watch tv, you know, And I was thinking, wow, man, you've really got some incredible. You're just waiting to die, aren't you? What I feel sorry for, right? Two things, you know, in like Stars in Their Eyes and you get a little fellow and he. And he's got in fish in a. Some sort of factory in Bolton. And he comes on and he does, you know, someone like Bobby Darren. Okay. And he's. And. And Matthew Kelly comes out after as well. I don't think you'll be going back to the fish factory. You will. You will be going back. You will. Straight back. Yeah. Let's think about all I stuff that. I'm Kelly, because that's a nice thing to do. I'm trying to think. Trying to think of all the Stars in Their Eyes, contestants that have gone on to great things. What happened to that little fella? Looked like the little Alsatian puppy that did Christopher. He looks a bit like Christopher. He looked like he had problems. Well, I. Yeah. Now, what was it Is Ian Moore, his name was. Now he. Now he was. Well, it's interesting. My friend bought me as an ironic gift for my birthday, he bought me the live video of Ian Moore. You'll be pleased to know that lady in Red was on there among a number of other hits. But it was. It was really out of picture. Ian on the front it said Ian Moore. Naturally. I didn't Think it was too big for him as well. Of course, it was ludicrous. But I don't know if that meant Ian Moore, naturally. Like, we all know this guy is. It's Ian Moore. Yeah. Or was it Ian Moore? He's no longer being Christopher. He's just natural. What does he sound like when he wasn't being Christopher? Christopher. Did he really? Because he met him, didn't he? He met. Yeah, well, Christopher. I think Christopher couldn't wait to get back on the telly. Well, the thing is, I think. I think Ian Moore is actually earning more than Christopher now. I think they could have got Christopher on there. Yeah. You can get Christopher for a thousand pounds, but Ian Moore's gone up for 1200 now just to the PI to, you know, adapt. But he does Lady. There's all the hits he does. Don't Pay the Ferry Man. Yeah. Don't even Set a Price. There's all those. Interestingly, I saw him interviewed once and Lady In Red's not his favorite song. You're joking. It's bizarre, isn't it? But he was only going to play that if. If it was the fat, ginger Sarah Ferguson. Oh, yeah, yeah. It was only if she was wearing some red. He was only going to play that way. Yeah, it was a live thing and he was only gonna play that if she was wearing red or something. Right. Didn't have freckles. That's beautiful. No, so she had. Luckily she had a red. That must have clashed with her a bit. Yeah. A red scarf on. On her face. And the highlights in your hair that catch the light. Yeah. Such a beautiful lyric is so lovely, isn't it? The thing is, right, he misses a rhyme, there he goes. I asked you to dance Looking for a little romance now he could have said dance, couldn't he? I met a man once in a bar I was talking to him. For some reason, I was annoyed by him. I always wind up by him. And I said that I'd written Lady In Red and I never got any money for it because I found out he was like a music lawyer and he went, well, give me a call, I'll investigate that. He was actually gonna do it for me. I love the idea of that. Why did you say that? Really bored. And I didn't like him much and I was just. And I thought that was. Why did you choose lady in Red, though? Because I think I was singing it with a friend of mine and he came over and went, oh, good voice. And, yeah, I wrote this. What pub is this? It was north, is it? Yeah. Never seen looking as lovely as you did to Naid. So, anyway, those. That's enough of my Christopher anecdotes. Yeah, that's very much the end of. The show, and it is. It's been a great. It's been a great show. Have I got time for a song for the Lovers or if I missed that? No, if you're giving me. Yeah, what are you gonna play? What are you gonna play? What are you gonna play a song now and then. We've got time for it. No, you'll have to give it me. Yeah, I better dig it out. What have you chosen? I'll keep it going. Well, a friend of mine who keeps making me look compilations has stuck on an old Tom Waits track, which is from his first album, one that I've not listened to for a while. We listen to it. It's an absolute dinner. Brilliant. Brilliant. Can anyone hear me? Yeah. Yeah. He's just getting out of his bag now because we were. We weren't prepared for this. We sort of ran out of time. We're having such a great time with the philosopher philosophy of car. What do you fancy doing, anyway, with your future? Me? You know I'm just gonna tell you now. You know we're still on air, don't you? Before it gets too casual, you know, we are still broadcasting to the capital. Okay. Yeah. What do you fancy doing? Well, once I've made all that money from suing Krista Burr. No, you know, my future. I'm living my future. And I wanted to have some good mates like yourself and Ricky. Yeah. You know, Carla wanted to be on the radio. We like the Three Musketeers. Me, you and. See, it's like. We're like the original Rat Pack, which. We're Ocean's Eleven. I'm Sinatra. Yeah, you're Sammy Davis Jr. And you're. What's his name? Dean Martin, aren't you? Yeah. Or Joey Lawrence. What's his name? Joey Lawrence. Not Joey Lawrence. Joey Bishop. Joey Deacon. Joey Deacon. My dad said the ending on the old one's better than the new one. We should definitely get your dad in, man. That would be just dynamite. When people get tired of you, we've got the whole Pilkington family, the whole gene pool. Have you seen it? No. Carl, have we got time for this now? Really, mate. What track? To be fair, okay, it's track number one. Now, interestingly, about Tom Waits is that this is from his first album. And he doesn't sound like that kind of gruff, you know, lived in guy that he wants to do something of a crooner. Yeah. But this is a track called OL55, which bizarrely, I think might be covered by the. The Eagles. But anyway, so I think it's really lovely track, really beautiful track. I'll see you next week. And we'll see you next time. Say goodbye, Carl. See ya. Say sorry. For what? For Effie offended anyone. I didn't. If I say sorry, that's saying I'm guilty.",
