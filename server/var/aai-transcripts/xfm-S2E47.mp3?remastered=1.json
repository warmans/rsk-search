  "text": "Tom putting the Heartbreakers breakdown. And that's for Carl's behavior last week. Carl, you seem to be a little bit happier last week. I mean, we were worried about you. Were you sort of slipped into some sort of, like, weird depression? You played placebo twice, so you weren't concentrating. I know you're gonna say that me and Steve were annoying you, but, you know, that's an easy excuse. I mean, I think the listener can make up their own mind. So it's just like I say, though, it's like a murderer. Right. It might not have done that if it was a different day, if the sun was out, whatever, and everything just happened at once. That wound me up. Right. So it was like a crime of passion. You'd be let off because those. Those sort of circum. You'd never put yourself, say, in a position again where you'd. We'd have two people trying to wind you up for, you know, the sake of fun and laughter for the public on a tin pot radio station between 1 and 3 every Saturday. You'd never do that again, would you? Last week it wasn't just for the listeners, it was for you as well. Between 12 and 1. You were winding me up then. You know what I mean? Having a discussion. It's all right. I'm used to it. I'm used to it. So. Yeah, but I found out that I can't do this job anymore. I can't do these sort of jobs where you've got to be happy all the time. We don't have to be happy all the time. Oh, you do get that. If you forget that. For the. I mean, I've got things going on in my head. Do you think when Bobby Davros had a bad day that he doesn't go on stage and give 100%? No, but that's that. Do you think Les Dennis let all that stuff get in his way when he did that theater tour to the. The people? Sometimes he had audiences. Yeah. And he just went, it's there. It's not my private life. Forget that. Bang. He can do that. But what I'm saying is I can't. He's a professional. So I was talking to Suzanne about it because, you know, it did get me down. Suzanne's your therapist. Yeah. Saying to her, you know, I can't. I can't do this sort of job. Normally, what I do in the week, you know, I'm tucked away in a studio. If I'm annoyed, no one knows about it. I get me head down, I get on with it, mate. Do you tell them. Go on. Next. Next. Next. Yeah, but. Sorry, so. But what's your point here? So every Saturday you've got to come here, you've got. You've got to be happy. We've got to go. Oh, Carl, are you alright? Oh, you're right. Your hair looks nice. No, no, but, you know, I mean, that's the first time in it. Normally people listening go, he's a happy fellow. You know what I mean? They never think you're a happy fellow, Carl. They've never laughed. No one has ever. Seriously, we get emails all the time. No one's ever heard you laugh. Yeah, I'm still happy. You don't have to. Well, are you? Yeah. You don't look happy. But anyway, that's, that's the problem with this job. And I was thinking about it. If, if. Do you know, like, if you're a doctor. Sure. And you're on a plane and something happens. Yeah, yeah. Even though you're on holiday, you might. Have to save someone's life just because you can. Next. And I'd be thinking, I'll keep quiet. Sure. See, that's one of the reasons why you didn't actually qualify as a surgeon. Ye. I mean, you can still do your consultancy stuff. Oh, sure. But, you know, you just don't actually want the knife in your hand anymore. Brilliant. So you're giving this up. Higher. Sorry. And how is. How is a doctor on a plane comparable to this? Because that is just the same situation. Do you know? I mean, he's probably got his shut. Shut off. He's ready for his holiday, he's going. To Hastings for a night. Someone, you know has a little bit of tummy trouble or heart attack or whatever. Yeah. And is he a doctor on the plane and he's like. I've got to loosen his tie. Yeah. I can't do what? I don't understand. Carly's. You get paid to do this. It's not like we're forced. It's not like it's your holiday. You know that. This is your job, this is paying for your new kitchen. Exactly. But I've got the kitchen now. Still not right. So when are you stopping? When you're quitting. Well, you're. You're finishing, aren't you? In a couple of weeks for a bit. No, about four. Yeah, we're finished on the 16th of August. Yeah, but you know, we're only going away for like six or seven weeks again, aren't we? Well, you don't know yet. Do you? Well, we'll give up if you give up. Tell you tell your managing directors that. Well that's, that's a bit annoying. Why? Because you've just passed the book, haven't you? I haven't passed the buck, which is this three way. You know, you get, you get your name in heat, you're in the title now. It's Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant and Carl Filkington. And now you want to go. I don't want to do it anymore. Think about it, think about it. You've noticed, but we don't provide anything on this show. So if you leave, we have to go now. Just think, don't be so selfish. Don't be so selfish. We need you. We've got nothing. Think of it. Molly's Chambers, Kings of leon, brilliant on XFM 104.9. So I'm not gonna pressure on you, Carl. I know you're scared to be saying this, right. But I'll tell you what we do, right? We're stopping this show on the 16th of August. We're, we're going to film the office specials. Okay. And we'd be coming back, I don't know, August, September, mid October if Kyle does. Yeah. Now I know that's pressure, but that's it. I think it is. I think this is a three way show so you don't have to do it. What should we do? Because we've, I know we've been approached by a couple of others. What would you do? We've been approached by obviously better radio stations. I mean just think of, I mean if you're a listener, just think of any of the radio stations you prefer to listen to. That's some of the ones that have offered us gigs so we could toy with those. Or we stay and we see this through and we get XFM on the map, we get a few sounds. I know, Rick, I know you've had a passion since you started working at XFM to get the listeners into double figures. I know that's what have been one of your ambitions and I think it'll be a shame to give up so soon because you've done so much hard work. Yeah. So that's for you to think about, I think. So we've got what we. So we've got four weeks left. That might be four weeks forever and never coming back or four weeks for like an eight week period. And that's for you to think about. So think if you enjoy the next. Four weeks, Carl, but like I said to you though, the Reason I did this. Yeah. Was to get that kitchen. Right now, Brilliant. As we speak now. Right, Builders in the flat. He's been annoying me. Of course he has. Of course he has. What's he been doing when he. When he turned up on a Monday, Right, yeah. Wanders in and the first thing he says to me is, said the pub across the road, is it any good? I said, well, it doesn't matter, does it? You're working on the kitchen. Think of saying that to a builder. Probably making conversation. Probably meant, do they do a toasted sandwich? Because I got a half hour lunch break, not an hour like Carl Bilkington. So I'll probably go and get a nice, you know, cheese and tomato sandwich. Yeah. You mean what you said to me? Suzanne had a go at me saying, why have you said that? He hasn't even started on it yet. I cannot believe that. You're unbelievable, Carl. And you say it's us that are rude, crass. I just was. I just was letting him know, do you know what I mean? I know what he was there for. He knows what he was there for. He had it down on his little docket, do the kitchen this week. He didn't come there and go, what the. What did I come out for? Was it to go to the pub for a week? Why am I wearing these overalls? Yeah, who's the little bald mane twat insulting me? Let me just check. Let me call the head office. I wasn't having a go though. I mean, they should have finished it yesterday and they're there now on their own. And what annoyed me is they turned up late today. Hold on, Carl, I've just realised something. They're probably listening to the radio. This, I assume tuned to xfm, isn't it, in your kitchen? Yeah, but they don't know it's me, do they? Do you know what I mean? No, they'd go, he's got a whiny mank voice as well. So is the bloke who owns this place and the bloke owns this place. When I said, what's that pub like across the road? Said, well, he won't be bothering you that he's working on this. No, he won't be able to put two together with he. The penny's dropped, hasn't it? You've suddenly realised, look at his face. He suddenly realised they might know it's. Him and they could be listening and they're going to clean you out, mate. Oh, if you are the builder working in, where is it? I won't say the address. But it's central London, isn't it? Yeah, go mental. Have whatever you want opposite that pub. That you like that you're probably in. There now so it won't be like. Or insulting. Insulting a British workman. He should have been this morning. I don't. I really don't understand why they've got to start so early. Right. Yeah, but he said he'll be there for eight. Turn up at half nine. Right. Wanders in and what annoys me is he could have left all this downstairs. He had a paper under his arm, one of those crossword books and a Pot Noodle. Now I'm not being funny, but most of them took quite a bit of time. A crossword book he's not happy with just the one that's in the paper. If you're listening, if you are the builder that's listening now doing Carl's flat. What about pissing in the laundry basket? Lonesome Day. Bruce Springsteen on XFM 104.9. So you've realized now that the builder could well be listening. Knowing exactly who you're talking about. There's a. There's a chance of it, you know what I mean? Yes, I didn't think about it, but you're right, you know, was tuned on to that. I think he did flick it on. Thinking about it, thinking back, if so. Yeah, he's probably listening now. No, he probably isn't. He probably isn't. About half hour and if he's got any sense he turned it to heart or Virgin or magic or something, but, you know, there is a chance. Good advice to the listeners. Yeah, if you've got any sense. If you finish the crossword puzzle, I. Think, you know, according to our figures, there's a 5% chance of him listening to it. So if, you know, if we want to be accurate. Although he is in a house with it tuned to that, so I think it gets. Puts him right up to 50 straight away. Then again, Rick, he's got a job of work, so why would he be listening to this show? Well, he's doing a crossword at the moment. Yeah, well, you, you better hope he's not listening. Well, I mean, they do annoy me. I'll. I'm sticking, I'm sticking by it. Yeah, you might as well keep digging. Yeah, go on. No, I'm just saying they do annoy me. The way they wake you up at 8 and then. Well, that's when they start work because. I've told you, I mean. Oh, we'll Leave that one, then. Yeah. No boys. Like the other day when. When they came in, I always like to test them, you know. I mean, when I had some work done on the last flat that was in, right, that was renting, the builders were in, sorting the shower out and that. They woke me up about half past seven. Yeah, right. Were you in the shower? Good thing about a cleaning shower, there's never any hair down the plug hole. Yeah, all right. So I. I left early to come at work. Right, sure. And I thought, I wonder what they're doing. I wonder if they have started. So I walked back to go back in. They'd left the flat and they were outside having a Starbucks. And it just annoys me that they couldn't do that first. You know what I mean? Have your breakfast first, then come and wake me up. But don't wake me up to. Then get me out of the flat and then say, right, let's go and have breakfast. They've probably got to get in, haven't they? What for? What for? They can put all the tools in the. In the little lobby bit. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, just winds me up. Sure. Now, the thing is, the guy today who's doing the tiling, that's narrowed it down a bit more. When I knew he was in there, I went out for a bit, had a cup of tea and a bacon butty. Yeah, right. A coffee. And I went back and I kept. I was really quiet, put my key in the door and opened it really quick to see what he'd be doing. And he had actually started work, so fair play to him. What if he's just been exfoliating himself naked on the kitchen floor? Yeah, I'd say. Right, caught you. Yeah. So, yeah, if you're listening, go through the wardrobes upstairs. They won't get anything. I've put everything in places where they wouldn't think are lucky, looking for jewelry and stuff. So you're thinking that where we put the jewelry. I'm not saying. Go on. So you're thinking that they're gonna thieve from you as well. Okay. So if you're listening, don't think about the obvious places when you're looking for the jewelry. No, but I. I do things that I would do. Things like, you know, just pop a little bit of urine, maybe in the salt cellar or something. Yeah, just do something. I'd say what I do is I take the. Take the toothbrushes in the bathroom, just pop them in the toilet, flush it, and then take them back again. Just put them back in there. Leave them nothing. Leave them out. When they were coming last week, I brought the biscuits to work. Suzanne was like, no, we didn't, mate. No, no, you weren't that tin. It was just a packet of good quality cookies. Good quality cookies, yeah. You thought, I'll be down if they're. Oh, God. But that's what Suzanne always says. Don't know. You know why, why you like this? Because, you know, it's not as if you've been sort of harmed as a kid or anything, but I like the. Fact that you once said to us, you don't need friends. You don't like friends because they're a bit of a pain, because they call you up and they want to be. With you, but mates are a hassle. I woke up today, right, and I think it was on. Might have been on 5 live or something. This morning in the bedroom, right, and they were talking about how it's Nelson Mandela's birthday. 80 odd. 20,000 people turning up at his party. I thought, I'm glad I'm not in. I couldn't be dealing with that. 20,000 people. Think of the carpet afterwards. I mean, a good percentage of him will put in out fagbirds on his carpet after Tommy Walsh and Charlie Dimmock, what's her name did Lovely, lovely patio in a water feature. It's gonna. He's gonna come back and he's gonna go, it's ruined. And what's he doing for his birthday? Karaoke. Chinese meal, but karaoke. I wonder why. I wonder what Nelson Mandetta's birthday party is like. Big cake, bit of enormous cake. Yeah. Jumping out. Yeah, it was for us girls. Well, everyone. I don't know. We are the only three people that hasn't met him. I thought everyone would have been in the cake. Yeah. Just in case. You never know. And if Winnie calls, I'm not here. Have you not invited her? No, of course I. No, definitely not. Poor Nelson. Happy birthday. How old is he? 85. Oh, well done. No, God bless him. God bless him. Oh, 85 today. Oh, right. Bit of songs of phrase next then. Yeah. Do you reckon? Really? What's that one? Everybody says that they're looking for a shelter. Silence Is Easy by Star Sailor on XFM 104.9 sorry, just suddenly struck me something. I don't know if I mentioned it before. You mentioned you tried to catch your. Your guy out when you came back once you opened the door really quickly to see what he was up to. Did I ever tell You. When I was at university, now I'm very tall and I've got enormous feet. Size 14, size 14 shoes. And when I was at university, everyone, it seemed to me, was wearing Dr. Martins. It was like you had to wear a pair of Dr. Martens. It was kind of the rule. Dr. Martins was big for you. Yeah. So that's a big pair of Dr. Martins. That's like, that's where the myth of the old woman who lived in a shoe. I know people with my size shoes. Anyway, I. I just literally kind of moved to university. I'd been there for literally a couple of months. And obviously in that first period, you're quite keen to kind of, you know, reinvent yourself, you know, strike yourself, you know, try and give an impression of perhaps being quite sophisticated, worldly, cool, all those things that, you know, you've left behind, all your childhood friends. So you're trying to, you know, develop something. He didn't bother. He didn't. Was I. He didn't bother. No, no. I was working hard in it and I was kind of, you know, I was doing all right. You know, I had the tie dye shirt and I was looking good and so I was working hard to try and seem kind of cool and not freakish. And I came back from studies once and I came in and there's a little old cleaning lady that kind of would always come in every day and clean up our halls of residence. And I came back and my door of my room was open and there was like a little huddle of people just peering in, right? And I went, this is odd. You know, my door's open and I'm not in there and there's people staring in the door. And I looked in and the little cleaning lady had my Dr. Martens on and was clomping around making them all laugh, doing. Making them all laugh, doing an impression of me. That's amazing. Imagine that. Imagine the psychological scars that that has. I love that she's more popular than you. Yeah, exactly. And they go, come on, Maud, let's go to the jcr. And they carry her down, they drink, drink, drink, drink, drink. And she goes to you, Steve, you better have that spotless by the time I come back. You go, all right, I will. All right. But what I like is the fact that I'm sure that that's part. That's not part of the cleaner's code. Keys to everyone's room so you can go for their belongings and, and play practical jokes. I mean, surely it's a kind of, you know, It's a trust. So you must have looked like a wall bracket. I went bowling with him once, the first time. And he. And we went bowling at this place. Where was it? I mean, Finsbury Park. And I'd never been before and he's got to wear special shoes. He went, he goes, have you got size 14? And she went, yeah, I've got one pair. And she put them on the table and they look like Crusty. Honestly, they're, they're. Honestly, it looked like it was. I just started laughing because they look. They're so long and thin anyway. And they're multi colored, aren't they? They're two colors. And it looked like Crusty's. It's Crusty the Clown's feet. And then this teacher's going, all right, all right, 14. That is big. It is a huge size shoe, you're right. Yeah. And it was just the one cleaner in them. Just the one. She did have loads of kids eventually and brought them up in there. Well, we got Songs of Phrase. Songs of Phrase then. Okay, let's just have a look at the prizes. Let's just remind us again what exactly Songs of Phrases. Because I know a lot of people put it out of their mind week by week. It's a phrase that's, you know, been said on the show a few times at night. Oh, you remember classics like what was. What was. What was that? Hairy Chinese kid. Yeah, there's this hairy Chinese kid. Stop squeezing me head. Carl, you're an idiot. Carl, you're an idiot. You know some classic phrases. Classic phrases. And so you use various old time songs and you put them all together and that spells out the phrase before I. We play that. Let me tell you. Now you can win. Look forward to this. What's this? The new album from the Star Spangles. That's called Bazooka. Is that out? Is it? Never heard. What's Bazooka? Never heard. Never heard of them. Never missed the best summer holiday album in the world ever. You've got the treats on there. Include the Fast Food Rockers and Laz Ketchup. Yeah. I'm waiting for their second single because I don't know what that's going to be about. Sure. Is it going to be a bit more fast food, maybe like Preta Monger? Yeah, yeah, lovely. This is very good. Yeah. Two disc set. The Best of David Bowie. Inspiral Carpets. The best of them. Still don't know how they spin that over three seasons. No idea. Bowie's is one. Yeah, we mentioned it last week. The American Song Poem Anthology. That's kind of a kooky collection of songs. And we've also got A couple of DVDs here. Stephen King's Rose Red. I've never heard of it. Straight to video. Yeah. Made for television. Yeah. Yeah. Never be seen at the cinema. And I know, I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of nerdlingers listening, so they will be loving Richard Dean Anderson in Stargate SG1. Free. Inside there's a collector's card, plus you can win some exclusive memorabilia. So I think a pair of. All you've got to do is listen to these, like 13 songs, probably to write a well known stupid phrase. It's only seven. Seven different songs. Right, well, just get the most you can just get. Be rough artist or song do. Right. And the phrase is about me dad nicking from telephone boxes. Right. You got to give them a clue because they've got to get. They've got to know what they're listening for. It's hard enough when you know dad is never going to stop Robin from telephone box. Is that it? Yeah. So what are these. What are these songs, then? It doesn't matter that some people don't know what that's about, do they? Doesn't matter. No, they're not. They don't. Well, your father's a thief. Email only. Ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk let's hear it. All right. Also not grammatically correct. So it's Daddy never gonna stop Robin from telephone box. Rubbish. Unbelievable. I think we just need the song. That's all we're after. Yeah, just the songs. Just again. Well, this is a desperate feature. It really is. Aw. See, Rick, if we took more of an interest in this show, we'd have. Come in, listened to that, we'd have said, no way. Look at how long you spent on it. We've got a reputation. Yeah. We've won awards, we've won major awards. We're not putting that tat out, but, yeah. No, you know, that's what. That's what. But we're just giving the listener what they're used to. Exactly. So I think more fool them for listening. Ricky.gervaisxfm.co.uk. Eminem Business on XFM104. Carl, can I ask, because after last week's show, when you had your breakdown, you went off to Hastings with your girlfriend stroke carer Suzanne. Now, what does she. Because whenever we meet Suzanne, we bumped into Suzanne recently, the BBC, Ricky and I. She's Always very nice to us, very polite. We have a nice little chat. But I'm always wondering, what is it that she thinks of us, really, you know, because I'm assuming you immediately go home and whinge. They tortured me. You saw. They tortured me on air. Now, what does she. What does she make of us? Did she listen to the show last week? Yeah, she did, yeah. She knew. She knew I was annoyed, right. So she sort of gave me a look like. You know what I mean? Like that when I. Because we went to age. That wasn't because you had, like Marmite or something over your face? No, no, it was like. So we didn't talk for a bit. I just was like, you know, getting over it, thinking, I'm sick of this. Yeah, right. You know, is the new kitchen really worth it and all that. I phoned him up, left a message after the show. I said, you seemed a bit quiet when you left. I just want to make sure it wasn't anything. I said. Well, no one. You're still doing your Samaritans? Yeah, yeah. Did it ring or did you just ignore it? Let it go to answer machine. I think I turned it off. I left it off. Just left it off all day. What does she make of us? Does she genuinely think. Does she not really like us? It's weird because there's no one who she doesn't really like, which annoys me because she says to me. Well, she says to me, I'm the opposite. Do you know what I mean? I'm like, oh, everybody annoys you. Yeah. And it's like, well, but that. That's my choice. Right. And that's why I don't bother getting mates and that. Sure. It's just hassle. Yeah, right. Yeah. But the problem is sometimes me being like that affects stuff that she wants to do. So, you know, if a mate, like. See her family and friends. Well, let's not say her family or friends, but say if one of her mates had a baby. Right, right, right. I mean, you know, naming no names. So this happened. Well, I've just got a. You gotta watch what I'm doing. The builder who knows you're slacking him off. Yeah. So, you know, she's got a few mates who have had kids recently. Right. Yeah. So. So one of them advocated. Yeah, go on. And she wanted to go and see it. Right. And she said, you can come with us. And I was like, you know. You know, I feel about babies. Sure. You've seen one, you've seen them all. Yeah. Like mouse, myth. Why do I need to see another one? Right. And she's like, yeah, but come and see it. You know, you get on with them, come see him. And I was like, it's a long way away. Yeah. I mean, that's probably narrowed it down again. Yeah. So. And that. That annoys her because I can't be bothered. What did you say? You say, no, I'm not coming to see him. I don't, don't like going all the way to Swindon. What did she. What did she. What did she did? Yeah. Or Birmingham or or Cornwall. Well, you. You know who you are. If you had a baby sort of. In the last time Carl didn't show up and Suzanne said what did. What Suzanne? What, what excuse did she say? You're working or busy or. Well, to be fair, I was working. Right. And they are nice people and stuff. Oh, now you're backtracking. Cuz now do they listen? Do they listen to the show? They might. They might do. So, you know, they listen to the show. So once again you've got an anecdote where the people who you've admitted to not liking to see their baby or care about them are listening to the show. Maybe, I don't know, maybe the builder's listening. Once again, nice people. I like them just, just, Just sneeze in the chilli pot. When the kid's older, I'll go and see them. You know what I mean? When it's got its own little character as a baby, it could be any baby. It's got nothing to offer me. I know what you mean. I know what you mean. It could be a toy baby. Well, you know, I mean, it could. Be a bag of sugar. No, I know what, I know what you mean. Yeah. When it can start talking and, you know. Yeah. Got good toys and stuff. It's well worth going. But at the moment. Yeah, I'll see, I'll see you when it smells. You go, oh, my God. Yeah, but you put it to bed. Let's have a game of Scrabble. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. But. Yeah, that's, you know, that's what we're talking about on that. On our way to Hastings last week, for me, you know, that's where I went to chill after the. And that's where you decided you couldn't give 100 to the public if you weren't having a good day. Like me and Steve do come rain a shine on a tin pot radio station. That really doesn't, you know, keep. Keep me in frappuccinos. These days. We'll say, we'll say once again this is official and it's not to a pressure on you that me and Steve are going away for a couple of months on the 16th of August to do the office special and if Carl doesn't come back nor will we because I see it as a three way thing and that's the truth. Rick, you said that a couple of times now as though you're expecting a flood of emails and calls. Nothing. No, I'm just trying to get in pressure because I know for a fact that they obviously they want us to come back and I know, I think. Maybe not the listeners though. No, the listeners don't care. They don't care who stands in. Do you know what I mean? Stanley, what frequency is magic? It's 105.4 worth checking out because I'm a great heart is 106.2 I think. Oh, virgins. No, virgin's 105 point. Bloody good station. What is that? 105.8. Yeah, which is. Well check press for details but watch some cable TV there's some good stuff on. Yeah, kisses 100. That's easy to remember. There's a new Ride album out, gentlemen I think you're probably quite excited. It's London's Heart 1i 6.2. It's released on the 4th of August and it's all the BBC sessions, all the stuff that Ryde did over the years for Virginia. 105.8 for BBC and this is one of them it's called Timer for a Time I think it's from the album Going Blank again It's very good. Play it, Carl. I play that for Pippa who requested some Ride that's from a new compilation called Waves and it's the BBC recordings that Ride made during the 90s and I think that was originally recorded for BBC Radio 1. That's a good station. Bloody good station. That's a good station if they're interested Radio 1 I think they pay quite well as well. Well, I enjoyed working for them I. Know we used to work for them for a period of time until we. Got fired for slagging off Simon Mayo. I think it was Simon Mayo. Do you remember that? I can't quite remember it well we. Used to do this thing, Marion Hobbs at night and we, we were. We were getting a bit busy and so we were constantly handing in shoddier and shoddier work. We used to like that and hand it to them A theme there A theme I Know. Yeah. And to the point where they kept going, oh, like every other week ago, we couldn't put it out. Well, because it was the most offensive or it was inaudible or it was twaddle or you didn't record it. You know, there was things like that. And then the, the, I think the, the straw that broke the camel's back was some. Mayo had just broken the world Guinness world record for DJing. And we were going, oh, that's brilliant. Yeah. In an air conditioned studio with loads of scroats, getting cappuccinos for him. That's not work. Our dad used to bin walls, build walls, you know, that's work. Not sitting down if he wants to break a record for work. And we went, things like, I, I know we going, we know birds who do ler stuff to feed their smack addiction. Yeah, that's work. I want, I want to see Mayo on his knees outside McDonald's giving a rent boy a blowjob and all this sort of stuff. I want to see him hanging up in some kind of leather strap in. A Amsterdam torture garden with 13 blokes jizzing on him, all with beards. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But why, why aren't you still there? I think the producer at the time said, we can't. I said, why not? I said, we're not did it, we're saying we'd like to see him do it. Right. And she went, he's a Christian. Well, we were talking earlier about friends. You say you don't like making new friends, do you? You're kind of repulsed by the idea of new friends because there's too much responsibility. They might phone you up, they might ask you for a favor, they might need a shoulder to cry on. You don't want any of that responsibility, any of that concern. But I'll tell you what's worse than making new friends is when old acquaintances come out of the past. It really unnerves me because I'm constantly bumping into people who I just don't recognize. I know I've got this urge to be polite. I can never just go, I don't know who you are. I always pretend I've looked for clues. When they say, you still. I go, yeah. So I go, right, and what about so and so? I go, so you know those two people? And it's like a saw in my brain going, ah, I must know them from so and so. Well, I went back to Bristol once and I remember walking to the bus stop and seeing someone I recognize from school and walking all the way to the next bus stop, just so I don't have to stand there and make conversation. Because I just thought, I've got nothing. Where's the conversation? I didn't know you then. If you move. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What can we talk about? We've got nothing in common except the fact that we went to the same school. I was on a train station platform fairly recently and the guy comes in, he goes, oh, Steve, how's it going, mate? I looked at him, stony fire. I had no idea it was. But of course I had to go, good, mate, good. How are you? How are you? And, you know, I kind of. I had a newspaper and I kept looking at the newspaper, thinking, every time I look at this newspaper, it's a. It's a clue for you to just walk away. But he never took the clue. He never took. So it was kind of. I'd say, oh, yeah, not bad, not bad. And he'd go, oh, where are you living at the moment? So I'd tell him, he'd say, and I'd look at the paper again. Oh, do you still know? But that's the way when you know they are. It's just as bad because they go, oh, we should have a drink some time. You want to go? I'll be honest. Look, if I wanted to get in touch with you, I had loads of opportunities about every day from. From now right back to the last 15 years. I could have made contact. I didn't. It's easy. Take that as a clue. Yeah, yeah. If you are listening to this and you know me from school or university, you're thinking of getting in touch, do not bother. Ditto. Ditto. I do not need your friends. You've got enough friends. Better ones. Better friends. I've got a number of better friends that I prefer. The reason I've not cut in touch, it's because I don't really like it. You've moved onwards and upwards. I know people now the likes of which have won major awards. Ricky Gervais sat right here next to me. That's all the friendship a man needs. If you have. If you have won four baftas, then give me a bell. If you have not, kindly stay in your little underneath your particular rock because we're not interested. We have kept you out of our lives for a reason. I did not accidentally lose your number. Oh, well, I promised to send you a letter. It did not. It did not get lost in the post. Nothing gets lost in the post. Oh, yeah, exactly. Carl, what do you think of that. Sorry, I'm. I'm honest with him, though, I assume, do you know what I mean? I just say, I don't know. You are. Can't remember you. Not bothered. You know what I mean? Oh, that is genius. Anyway, bit of Darkness. Oh, wow. Gotta play this. Now, be. Be warned, this is a rock ballad off the New Darkness album. I love the. Love the album. And that's the bit cheeky about this because it's got shades of Def Leppard, right, But there's a lovely balalaika but in it. And it's quite a nice song, right, and it's the Darkness. And then they can get away with this sort of thing for at least another four months. If you want me, I'm your country cardigans. You're The Storm on XFM 104.9. If anyone from Heart or Magic or Radio 1 or Radio 2 is listening, could well be available come October. Yeah, all right. Please get in touch. Yeah, I think that my new TV is too big, Rick. I said that I was thinking, but. I. I can't believe it. He talked about this, buying it. It's got a bit of cash now. What is it, 42 inches? 42 inch plasma screen. Wouldn't it cost you three grand or something? I don't tell. That's. That's. Wow. It's ridiculous. Three and a half grand. Big spender. Of course it's too big. Well, I can't get far enough back in the room, in the living room. For it, you know. You know, you're meant to be, I think, four times the screen size away from it, really, to get out in the air. So that's 4 times 42 inches. You're meant to be sitting away from it, which is impossible. Yeah, well, I just want to get friendly with the neighbours. Yeah, Once you throw a hat. If that's the case, though, are you better off just getting a portable? What? I don't understand that rule. What are you saying? Well, you're meant to be four times the screen size away from the tv. But then what's the point in having a big telly if you've got to keep moving further back? Get a portable and sit right next to her. Is that how they sell it? Is that what they say to you? Well, no, it's a rule, but I see. I do see your point. Why do people go to the cinema, then? Did you see films that are out? Yeah, fair enough. He's got you there. I tell you this, though. I had it delivered. And are you supposed to Tip delivery men. Of course, I don't know. Well. Well, if I've never had anything delivered. Before, not if it's a courier with an envelope, but if it's a bloke who struggled up the stairs, two flat blokes with a fridge, then give them a fiver for a drink. Was. I didn't realize. And I was thinking to myself, I wonder if I've got to tip him? And the guy was leaving and my mobile phone went off in my pocket. Yeah. And I reached in to get it. He put his hand out, thinking it was a tip. I went. I went, it's just my phone. I felt terrible after he left. I didn't know, what was I going to do? Run down the street and offer him a fiver? No, no, of course not. No, I'm not making money. I just spent it. Yeah. I got no money, mate. I just spent it all on this to clean out my jar. Everything. The drawers. Yeah, I'd say, yeah. Bottles back. What was it? The problem was, it took me forever to wire it in. I thought, I'm not gonna pay for someone to wire it up, you know? So I took about three hours to wire it in and it was huge. And I got it switched on. And the first program that was on when I got it wired in was Bargain Hunt. I'll tell you this, David Dickinson's tan almost took me eyeballs out. It was incredible. Oh, it was like X rays. A huge plasma screen with this orange thing coming up. And he keeps. And he keeps. Keeps turning to the camera, doesn't he? Just to get you. Yeah, he turns away, you get a bit closer, they go, what's he doing? He just turns around, takes the corner off. What do you think? Bargain Hunters. Oh, dear. That's why I'd buy a plasma screen to watch Bargain Hunt. I mean, it's. Dude. Because this is the problem is because you. Yeah, what do you want? Have you watched anything that's been worth having? The only thing I've watched, really. Worth watching. 24. Well, yeah, 24 works great. But also films, obviously. That's the main reason I bought it, because films just look amazing. Yeah. DVD on. On the plasma screen. You're into films and that. It's just that I only, you know, I've just got the. Got the five channels and flicking about. I'm not impressed. I mean, I can understand why more people listen to radio and stuff. Yeah. Because. Well, not this one, but. Go on. Well, when was it. When was the last time I sort of sat down and had Time. Because I'm always busy doing stuff on that. Sure. Moaning takes up about three hours a day. When did. When did Wimbledon finish? A couple of weeks ago. Right. Found myself sat there. Right. I'm not having a go. I know we stopped. Cheeky freak of the week and all that. Right. So I'm not. I'm not gonna be having a go. Christ, I'm sat there. I'm scared. No, I'm not having a go. You've always got to remember that. Go on, just get on with it. Get on with it. I'll apologize after. I'm just saying, watching Wimbledon, it wasn't, you know, one of the major games. It was little fellas in a. In a wheelchair having a. Having a game. Little fellas in a wheelchair. Right. But for me, I mean, you know, great. They're doing a sport and everything. Don't put it on the telly. What was up with it? It wasn't. It wasn't like a rally going on. No. Do you know what I mean? Do you know normally, like, with the. With the. Well, not two endmen, but with some of the other players and that. They're playing for ages, aren't they? It's like, oh, who's going to win this and that. Yeah. None of that. It was just like, is it net? Christ. Oh, God. I don't know what to do. People. People would, like, sat there watching it as well, when they've got all the games going on in there. That's what I couldn't understand. If you've paid your money to get in. Yeah. I mean, like I say, good on them if they do. You know what I mean? But it would have been. And they all start first in the marathon. I just thought it would have, you know, give them a game, a swing ball or something. Yeah. You know what I mean? I understand. There's never anything XFM in the community. Did anyone confirm? Actually, I had an email earlier. No, I'm not having a go, though. Tell them. This is what I'm like, aren't I? Sorry, this is recording you as well. What do you mean I'm not having to go tell them? Do what? You think you just said that to me? That you do you think you haven't got a microphone? You just said to London, keep wheelchair sport off the telly because they can't get a rally going. You call them little fellas in wheelchairs. What? And I meant to go. What Carl meant was. What? I mean. What, they can hear you as well. Yeah, I know. It's just that they might think that I'm having a go and I don't want them to. That's why I stopped Cheeky freak of the Week. Because some people got the wrong end of the stick. Right, what have you. Well, it was funny that a woman was born with the four legs. They might think you were taking the mech. Anyway, I just was wondering if anyone could confirm. We had an email earlier. I forget who sent it in, but thanks very much indeed for it. They said that the Paralympics began this week and apparently. What. During the opening show, the entertainment was provided by Riverdance. Now, I don't know. I don't know if that. I can neither confirm nor deny that, but it does seem rather tactless. Let's play a tune. Ricky Gervais. Ricky Dodge. Gervais xfm. Don't put my name on this last link. Don't put my name to this last link. Ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk Magic Virginia, if you're listening, we are available, probably sooner than we thought. Making plans for nigel xtc on xfm 104.9. Well, you seem a little bit happier now. Yeah, yeah, it was. It was all right. I'm a bit worried. But like I say, the last thing that we just talked about, I don't want people thinking, you know, we're having a guy at anyone, because that it does do me adding because I'm the one who always has to deal with it as well when people do what, you know, we're just talking, having a chat about tennis and stuff. Yeah, the little fellows in the wheelchair, as you put it. What are you worried about? Just that they think we're having a go and that. Because sometimes I do have to take calls and deal with it, all this stuff. Right. You don't see that. You don't see the house I'll have to go through. No, but I don't often say things where I. I'm likely to get a complaint. Yeah, but I'm just saying it wasn't meant to be taken badly. You're allowed to say you thought that the quality of tennis because they were confined to a wheelchair was poorer than, say, Sam Pras versus Agassi. I don't think that's in question. It wasn't as good a game of tennis. That's what all you were saying. You weren't saying they shouldn't play or wreck the grass. Right, mess. Well, stop. No, I'm just saying as well, just. I can confirm, incidentally, we've had several emails. I can confirm that Riverdance opened the Paralympics in Dublin recently, so I'm sure that was very good. Yeah, no, I'm sure it was entertaining. They're very good. It was it the thought. Was it, Jimmy? That thought it was short for Paraplegic Olympics. Really? I have no idea. Yeah. It's paradise. Parallel Olympics, isn't it? Yeah, but as we pointed out, that would be pretty much. Yeah. Blow football. Yeah. There wouldn't be many sports in the Paraplegic Olympics. It stands for parallel. Yeah, Olympics. I'm educating, Carl. Don't let me. I'm educating. I'm not saying. Funny little fellas. What? I'm always educating. I'm always telling you about stuff that I learn about and that. That you get off Anna Nova. And it's about a monkey who became king. Well. So, no. Have you got monkey news this week? Got a little bit of monkey news coming up. What does he do, Drive to Spain, rob a bank or get married? No, we're done. We've done all them, aren't we? We have done all them. Yeah. But, you know, it's a good one. It's a good one. And in fact, it's a bit related to what we've been talking about in a way. Oh, God, that's. That's good. Last week, after your nervous breakdown, you went to Hastings. Can I ask why the hell did you go to Hastings? It's so arbitrary. What do you mean? Why go to Hastings? You lost him on arbitrary. Why did you choose that above all other places within. It's amazing, isn't it? You look at his face when you say a word, you know he doesn't understand and it just goes dead. It's like when your computer freezes. Yeah, it is like that. Yeah. Is there. Is there an equivalent to control, alt, delete? When Carl just doesn't understand, so I have to press, like knob, bollock, finger up ass. It takes him out of his sort of stupor, doesn't it? Now, that's three things to press. But you've only got two hands, so. Wow. Yeah. Oh, God, what would I do? So I'd have. Hold on. So I could have the thumb. The thumb in my right hand, pop that up up his ass. I'd have my holding my index finger of my left hand on his knob. How would I press his testicles? What would I use? I'd have to use some other part. Should we try it? Yeah, let's go around there. Come on. What? I've already had a little. What happened? Carl. He loves it. I'm just gonna give you a little kiss, just for the webcam, all right? On the lips. No, not. Come on. I love it because he hates it so much. You won't get that radio on. Be me saying, I could have kissed Chris Moyles. What? Could have kissed Chris Moyles on Radio 1. Milesy. Give Milesy a little kiss for all his good work. Do you enjoy that? Yeah, it's good, yeah. What happened to Chris Miles show? Is he not on anymore? On the tv? Yeah. No, turns out he was too fat and talentless. Do you want to tell us about Hastings? Where did that come from? Eh? What? Yeah, Hastings. It's. It's all right. Yeah. What's there? Not much. It's just one of them. Yeah. Yeah, it's good. I think that's what's good about it. Nobody knows, right? Because last weekend it was roasting and. And you saw pictures of Brighton and it was heaving. Yeah, Right. Hastings. Hardly anyone there. And. Yeah, it's got a nice. Nice little beach. Yeah. Sand. Sandy. No pebbles. Well, that's all right. You're on the sand. It's a murder. Building a sandcastle. No, you just. Just sit. You can't walk on pebbles, can you? Well, it's all kind of. It's sort of a bit, you know, dodgy. All right. The only annoying thing is, right, it's one of them places that it's great to visit for a day. Yeah. But I wonder how people who live there get by. Why? Because all the shops like them things that you go in, and it's like a little pebble with a pebble stuck on the top and it says a Stins on it. Every shop does that. If you want bread and milk. You don't want. It's murder. Yeah. There must be a supermarket. I didn't see any. Seriously. It's all novelty, things like that. And then when I got back into. London, their houses just covered in pebbles and like, sea showers and stuff. Not rock for tea again. The funny thing is, right, it's. It's the first time I sort of noticed somewhere like that when you go, what do you do if you, you know, you just want some brilla pads or whatever? I'm walking in London. Never concern me that. Never needed brillia pads in my life. No, but you know what I mean, the sort of things that. Yeah, it's a bit tricky to find, but in London, you know, you've got the coverage. Now. The weird thing is, I was walking home from. We went. Had a drink the other night, right. Walking down the road. And there was a shop that just sold in London. Just sold chess pieces. Yeah. Is that the one on Great Portland street? Around the corner from it, yeah. Yeah, but that's. I don't think that's. I remember being in Brighton once and seeing a shop and all it sold was the foam you put inside cushions. Yeah. There's one of those at Pentonville Road. But I don't know who opens the shop. I know where these things are. There's a hole in the market. Yeah. What was that shop we walked past yesterday? And it was like something really, really. Oh, chef uniform shop. Yeah, It's Dundee Street. I'll tell you what, I opened the Chef, you know, mainly sort of check trousers and white hats. But there must be a lot of chefs around. I'm eating all the time. Someone's making the food. Yeah. The funny thing is, on the chess shop, right, they mustn't have been doing that. Well, and someone must, you know, the businesses must. The bosses must have been sat there going, not really working, this, is it. Yeah. People only buy one chess set in their life. Yeah. But the funny thing is, on the door, it's just said, come in and browse. Which I thought was odd. Did you? No, it was short. Right. The funny thing is, the funny thing is, right, so you can imagine them sat there going, oh, not doing that well. And it's changed. They've actually changed the name of the shop now. Yeah. And now it says Chess. Chess and bridge. Right. They've had to explain they've opened it up a little bit. Yeah, yeah. Still, what'd you buy for bridge if not? I don't know. Cards? I don't know. I don't know. I don't play bridge, but I don't know. I don't think you need a lot of stuff for bridge except a pack of cards. I remember going a table when I was three, friends on holiday once in Devon, past a shop. I don't know if you ever need it. If you ever need an antique marionette, let me know. I know where there's a shop. Okay. Yeah. Antique marionette. I know. Again, you only need one who goes into this business. Well, son, what are you doing? Going to university to do law, Father. Well, there's a factory there that makes the little plastic bits that goes on the end of chair legs. Do you want to take it over from me? We're not ready. No, it's all set up. Yeah, it's all set up. Oh, God. All right, dad, but just for a couple of Years. Someone's got to make them. So now the little plastic bits that go on the end of chairs. Well, if you make them call us on the 123-497-34. We're doing it. We're weird, don't it? Right, listen. Songs of phrase answers Next we'll go. I'll tell you what, play it once more so the people have got a chance to actually enter. Oh, I can't be. Should be ready Carl. This is terrible. There we go. All right. That is the well known phrase Daddy's never gonna stop robbing telephone box. The well known phrase. And we're looking for the songs. I think I don't care. Libertines on XFM 104.9 I'm Ricky Duraze. With me Steve Merchant over there is Carl Cayman Pilkers. I'd be great for Heart. You really wouldn't I Virgin. I'd be probably BBC Radio 2 would be my first. All one late night one would be good. All good stations. All professional stations. Yeah. Four weeks to go. Four weeks to go before we may give up or we may come back. Who knows? It's all up to Carl Cayman Pilcoids. Can I just extend an apology? I was a little bit crass earlier and I made some unsavoury remarks about Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles. I'd like to apologize. Funny man. Funny man Chris Miles. I'd like to apologize for that but it gave me an idea. You the listeners who do you hate? Email in ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk. i just think that we've never really used XFM as a kind of what is a research tool really. And it seems to me that we can get great opportunities. We don't sort of do this thing. We don't go on there and sort of like slag off other people and people in the public eye. Well, we pick on targets that can't fight back. Helpless, the elderly, you know, people suffering in some way that really, really and particularly we don't want to pick on people like Chris Moore who's got a big platform, much bigger platform. People who can't answer back. Yeah, we want. Yeah. So who do you hate? That's us. Who do you hate? We don't want. I don't want people you went to school with or your friends. You know, I hate Steve. Who do you hate? Rick. Right. My top three, just in your top three would be Hitler, Mussolini and General Pinochet. Really? No. Probably Milesy, Harry Potter and Jamie Oliver. But what are your Top three. Now, don't make them comical, don't make them. These are the people that wind you up. When you see them on tv, if you hear them on the radio, if you see them in a magazine, they just make you a kind of blood bore. Might be us. It could be us. We know that. Yeah. We're not stupid. We could take it as red that it's us. Yeah. And then let's assume it's us. So we want other people. Yeah, but we just. I want to drop the top lid. The top five people. I don't want to hear things like Tony Blair and Jeffrey Archer and fascism. Just people who make your flesh crawl for that. For no fault of their own. Well, really. Well, sometimes their own because that'd be. A good long, long term poll. Whenever. The next four weeks and then in four weeks time we go, we go, well, we're off. We're in the top 10. Exactly. But here are the other nine. So I think it's just genuinely gonna be quite, quite interesting. So, Ricky gervaisefm.co.uk maybe who you hate. And why, it's like giving a reason in the diary room. Yeah. You can't just nominate someone. You've got to say and why. Sure. But if you can't be bothered to write and why just nominate. Yeah, because that means just. We've got a lot of reading to do. If they start doing that, Rick. Yeah. Keep it down to one sentence. Yeah. You know, so the reason to be so and so because they can't walk. Something like that. Sure. Maybe. Now then we were playing earlier songs of phrase we have had. I mean the, the, the answers I could literally count on the fingers of one hand. Now the right answer is even less so. But do you want to play it once more, Carl? Oh, God. From. There was seven songs in there. Right, read them out, Colin. What are they? It was. Oh, have you ever got it written down? I can remember him. Daddy kill. Never gonna. Yeah. Right, I'm down. Stop. Sam Brown. Right. Robin was Ms. Robinson by someone and Garfunkel. Mrs. Robinson. Yeah, hang on a minute. That's not Robin. Oh, from, From Russia we love Matt Monroe. Telephone, telephone Hanging on the telephone Blondie and then box living in a box. Well, listen, no, I don't think anyone got them all right. If you did get them all right, I'm sorry, but I gave up checking the emails a long, long time ago. So I'm gonna give it. I'm gonna give it to Michelle Flower because she got a few of them, right. She Got a lot right there, actually. Well done. Good. Well done. She got well done, Michelle. And you get all those great prizes. Incidentally, we mentioned that Stargate SG1. I look forward to that, Michelle. That features Richard Dean Anderson, had a lot of emails, people saying, is that the same Richard Dean Anderson or Dickie Anders that used to email in, said he loved the show. What's happened to Dickie Anderson? I've not heard from Dickie for ages. So, Dickie, if you're listening, Richard Anderson, if anyone knows Richard Anderson, what's happened to him? I think we know his top three. Yeah. So, yeah, Dickie Anders, if you're in, if you're, if you're still out there, get in touch with Anders. Anders. I just was going to say, you know, you're talking about people who annoy you in that. Yeah. Not many sort of celebrities annoy me because I think, well, some people like them. You know what I mean? Yeah. But things that affect me, like the builders. The builders annoy me. Right, sure. And you could say that's a bit of stereotyping, but all the people who have met or been builders have always annoyed me. Right. So that's, that's because they've been working. On your house in your space. I mean, that's not, that's like all the builders that have been around your flat making a noise when you're trying to get some sleep have annoyed you. Well, that. Brilliant. But also someone in the office in the week, right, who works there, he's a good lad named Lenny. Right. Lenny. He proposed to his misses using xfm. So he popped in, he popped in Zoe's show, right. His girlfriend sat out there. She didn't know what was going on. She was after coming, even she wasn't listening. She was out there. She probably had a Walkman on or something. Yeah. Fax Jono with the request. Dear Jono, I'm broadcasting Mexico at the moment. Get my girlfriends listening to you. Oh, God, London's hot. 1 or 6.2. Great stuff. It's just that thing of like abusing your position. I think it annoys me. You know what I mean? Yeah. Because if he, I just was thinking, if he worked for a cab company, would he have done that over? I, I, that's what, that's one of my hates. Do you know what I hate? Dictators who have just sort of like they've got there by unfair means now. They're sort of like hurting the like little people on that. Really? Yeah. That's what I hate the most. Do you Know what I don't like? What? Famine. No, it winds me right up. Famine and disease. Tune from Wilko. It's called I'm the Man who Loves you from their album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Xfm 104.9. Who do you. You hate? Ricky.gervaisxfm.co.uk Fascists will co from their album Yankee Hotel Fox Clock. And that's a song called I'm the Man who loves you. Xfm 104.9. Ain't that brilliant? Evan Dando all my Life Beautiful on XFM 104.9. Well, it's nearly it. It's the big one. It's what people tune in for at. They probably tune in about 10, two these days for Monkey News with Carl Pilkington. We hear the jingle, only four to go. Oh, chimpanzee that. Monkey News. Right, this one's about a. It's been emailed into me, right? I haven't really had time to check it out this week. No, you're joking. It's not stupid. Goes back to 1908 and the person saying it's, you know, it's a good story and that, and they're surprised I haven't picked up on it yet, right, the Olympics, right, in 1908 in London. Apparently. It was meant to happen in. In Italy, but it was cancelled. Know why, right, it happened in London. Anyway, 400 meters, right? It was meant to. There's a fella who was going to do the run, right, and the favourite to win it was this Bulgarian guy. Right, okay, these are the few things it cannot be. One, he injured himself. So a monkey steps in and wins. Two, he does a drugs test. It turns out that he is a monkey. So if it's either of those, right, I'm gonna go mad. So anyway, so the fella, right, this, this favorite, everyone's putting the money on him thinking, yeah, he's gonna do it. Is he hairy? Is this bloke hairy? So anyway, so the race happens, yeah, and everybody's lined up ready to run and, you know, everyone's saying, yeah, he's gonna win, he's gonna win. Then suddenly, better murmuring going on, people going, what's going on here? He's eating a banana and there's a fella. There's a fella in the lane next to him. Yeah, right, he's going up. Who's that? He doesn't look familiar. Oh, Christ, right, Doesn't look familiar. Who's he? You know, what's going on? What's Going on? What's going on? Yeah, what is it? What is it? Who is it? I mean, I'm not. What is it? So they go in. So they say, well, he might not be that any good. Do you know what I mean? He might not be good. You know, it's just a bit short. Anything 3 foot 6 and he's hunched over on his knuckles. So I didn't realize it was fancy dress. Yeah. So I don't think he's gonna be any good. So. So the race starts. Putting his finger up his ass. That's weird for runners do that before a race. Yeah, Race starts. Yeah. The fella that no one recognizes wins it. People go, what? What's going on here? Yeah, sure. Do you know what I mean? We have our money on the favorite. What's gone on. Who is this guy anyway? He stood up there, right? He's looking, well happy. Yeah. He's lifting the trophy and everything. Right. Long arms. Long arms. That trophy's higher than. So anyway, he's only three foot, but. The trophy is nine foot in the air with those long arms. So I'm suspicious. Go on. They have the. They have the picture in the paper the next day. Sure. And everyone's going, yeah, he was fast and everything, but quite hairy for a run. I'll tell you. Quite hairy. Normally they shave themselves, don't they, to make them faster. How did he manage it? It's really airy and that. So anyway, he wins the stuff, he walks away with a cup. The people who are in charge of the running, or like the. The Olympic Committee, look further into it turns out it was a chimp. Right, Keep talking. No, don't keep talking. What's encouraging? Shut up. This is monkey news. If you can't handle the news. It's news from 1909. And I haven't heard about a chimp winning the Olympics. What happened there then? 400 meters. Right. Now the thing is. Talk shit. The only thing was, it took so long for the Olympic Committee, right? To find out that it was a monkey. It was going. It was like going like manic. It went into loads of races. It was picking up loads of, like, became a celebrity. It was doing endorsements on tv. Don't talk shit. It said he managed to win the same race four years later in Athens because. How did he get to Athens? With a joke. They're winding you up, Carl. Weird. It's not weird. It's Right. I do not believe it. Well, that's. Okay, That's. There's only three of them to go then, Right, because we're probably all leaving in four weeks time and that's the end. I am. I've got to get onto a sort of mainstream radio station because I don't think there's any other sort of tin pot place like this, is there? No. So I'm going to clear up my act a little bit. I've got an album from the Capital Radio library and it's the best punk album in the world ever. So if Captain Listening I can. I'm just going to show that I can do a mainstream. I'll play a classic song and I'm going to announce it right, and everything. So if you get a job on a decent station, you'll take me with you, will you? We're a pair, so. Okay, here we go. Right. If anyone's listening, just to show that I can do mainstream radio. Okay, well, that's all. Okay. Come on. Should I get a monkey and do it? It's all right. It's all right. Okay, well, that's about all there is time for today. You can listen to Ricky Gervais with me, Stephen Merchant across the way, Cayman Pilkers. We're going all the way back now. A classic song from the late 1970s. And this is Devo with Mongolo.",
