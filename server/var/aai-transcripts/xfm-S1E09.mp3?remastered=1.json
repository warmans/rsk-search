Isn't it already an error as occurred. Yeah, it could have been slick. But Steve, we've got some great music. I might have on a bit of a soul tip this week, to be honest. Yeah, I was a bit of a folky last week, but, you know, you got stuff from like, you know, early, early Bowie, some Stevie Wonder, a little bit of Groove Armada. We've got. We've got the classics, we've Coldplay, we got Blair, we got Ash. Sure. I haven't planned anything for the show. I've got nothing of you. You're just reading the list of songs that I'm thinking that will fill up some time. Anything interesting happen to you over the week? Nope. No, I just swore off air and car went, never swear in an on air studio. I love it when Carl tries to sound like he's professional and understands the business. Yeah, you don't fool us, Carl. Yeah, I wish I could buy. I wish I could buy like a car, you know, like those Garfields you can stick on a car window. Oh, yeah, I reckon they should be. We should be able to get a car like that that we could send out as a gift to people. That'd be lovely. Just this little face pressed up against the glass like a window liquor. Yeah, look at. You'd have to lick his face to stick it. Yeah, that'd be a choice. Bless him. All those things you throw out a window and it sort of like flaps down. You say they sell him for a queen. Yeah, exactly. Baby pigeons, that's what we used to use. Or frogs from the pond. Sure. It's cruelty to animals and I don't condone that. And it was a joke before the RSPCA phone in and say, stop throwing frogs at windows. Well, people who are listening. I don't mean the French, by the way. That is. That sounds like xenophobic before someone calls in and says, stop throwing French people at windows. So I'm digging myself into a hole here and I. It's all gone horrible. Quick mention the Germans and then this guy. Yeah, Yeah, I don't mind the Germans. No good, Carl. I was just. I wonder if people know what Carl looks like in the. In the wide world. Is there any reason why they should? Have you ever saw anything or. He's like Moby. He looks like Moby. He does look like Moby. Yeah. Does that help? Is that a compliment? Sort of a Moby who's mank had a bit of a tough paper around when he was younger. Yeah, that's right. A bit more knackered than Moby. Yeah, I think so, yeah. Yeah. See, I think Moby's great. He's one of those people that every opens his mouth. I saw. Oh, I'd love to be mates with him. He talks sense, he's interesting, he's lovely. I don't like his records. There's nothing I can do about that. If I ever meet, if I ever come top mates with him. And after about a few years of us like driving around and having a party. Oh, I'll go, Moby, I've never liked anything you've ever done. Is that what you do with your mates? Just drive round? What are you, 16? Never, never done that. Go to a car park and just do handbrakes? Never. I haven't done that since I was like 17 when like, it was great. If someone had a car, you couldn't. Believe that you were just moving. I remember once, right, my mate Bob had a car and there was me and another friend in it and we were young about and he did a U turn when he shouldn't and a. And this motorbike hit him and came off and the music, it was turning down, it was really, really bad, right? And he was there and he was really worried and the motorbike bloke was dazed and he went, you okay? I'm really sorry. And the bloke said, yeah. And I put my head out the window and went, sorry about that, mate. That's the third one today. And this mo. I just looked at him and he went, no, don't do that, Gervais. Why'd you do that? Why'd you say that? I just thought it'd be funny. I didn't really understand the, you know, the severity of this. Have I told on the radio before about that time when I. When I just passed my test and I was driving my parents Volvo estate and we went off driving down some country lanes. Is this the one with the. Yeah, yeah, I've told you. Have I? Yeah. Have I told you, Carl? Well, maybe tell you a bit. There's a great anecdote about Volvo estate coming up. Exactly. That's the kind of stuff you're getting on XFM this Saturday afternoon. Do you want some Coldplay or what? Oh, I'd love to. Coldplay. Don't panic. That's the title of the song as well as What I was saying, in fact, I was just saying the title of the song. Yeah. If I'm being honest, making it sound like it was. Conversation XFM 104.9. It's a Ricky Germat show with Steve Merchant. Thanks. You were going to tell us a little story about. Just passed my test. Yeah. My parents had a big, big Volvo estate and there's quite a big car to drive. My parents didn't have a car, but if you. I know you don't drive cars, Rick, but it's quite a big car to drive if you just pass your test. It's safe, though, innit? It is very safe. That was the thing. And I live come from the west country, obviously. There's quite a lot of windy lanes. You're joking, dear. They have cars there. Blimey. Carl learned on a tractor. Automatic, it was. Do you want me to tell it or not? Oh, don't poop up the accent. Oh, no, I worse. Oh, God. Oh, go on. So I went to this party. You never got him being from the North. Not when he's telling an anecdote. He's never telling an anecdote. Oh, yeah, fair point. Yeah, go on. So I went to a party and I was quite excited. Cause I had the car, I had the motor, and there was a chick heading down to the party that I was like, you know, I had my eye on. And I thought, you know, now I've got a car and they're going to the party. It's gonna be amazing. Right. Various friends had said, like, can we get a lift? I thought, yeah, groovy. Yeah, yeah, I'll pick up the chick as well. He was a friend of a friend. So cruising down to the party in the motor, you know, the Volvo estate. And there's nothing sexier than that, you know, slipping a little bit of Billy Joel on the stereo, whatever. Something classy. And maybe it was Billy Ocean. I was quite a Billy Ocean. Maybe it was get out of my dreams, get into my car. Ideally, yeah. So I get to the party and inevitably it was one of those house parties where the chick that I had my eye on, she kind of was chatting to other guys and she wasn't really paying attention to me. And I was sort of trying hard to get. Was she again? Same old story. Oh, they make me. They know how to tease, don't they, the ladies? Who are they kidding? So I'd follow her like a dog, you know, from room to room and. Watch her, quite literally. Sometimes he was barking and while, you. Know, just Watch her while she talked to other blokes. And then obviously I wasn't because I was driving, I wasn't drinking so I was not really enjoying myself. And then somebody said should we go and pick up Vera? And I thought right, okay. They went, Steve's got a car, let's all leap in there, we'll go pick up Vera. And this girl was like up for it as well. So I thought brilliant, you know, I'll be back in the car with her, you know, away from all these lads. One guy she had her eye on, he came as well. I was a little bit annoyed. Yeah. But anyway he was in the car. So I'm driving down these country lanes, just driving along and they're directing me, they're saying go left here, go right. And then suddenly we stop and he goes, one of them goes, just drive into that field, this pitch black field, right. And I'm sort of, well it's my parents car just driving the field stuff. I'm thinking, well I don't want to like not seem like I'm a hard, cool, crazy kind of guy because the chicks in the car so drove the car into the field, they all let Tank start running off into the darkness shouting Vera, Vera. Vera, where are you? So I'm just sort of sat there in the car waiting. Wasn't Vera Lynn, was it? Because she likes to hide in fields. Bizarrely it wasn't. It was just I was just left in the car on my own with Bill Ocean. And suddenly out of the darkness they come back holding a Vietnamese pot bellied pig that they had stole from a nearby farm. And they knew that the pig was called Vera because someone knew the farmer or something. Anyway, so they got this pig. So now they're going to put the pig in the back of the car, we'll take it back to the party, it'll be hilarious. I'm thinking, well you know, I'm not sure want a pig and all its, you know, piggy crap in the car, right. Crammed in there. But they say, yeah. So obviously I'm thinking again. I don't want to look like I'm you know, a nerd. You know, I'm terrified of that Rick ever happens. Yeah, yeah. So yeah. So you go hey, bring the pig into the car. Exactly. I'm no nerd. Yeah, go on. So now we drive off again. I got this pig kind of squeaking in the back of the car and they say stop again, stop again. Let's do some cow tipping. And they do that old thing, you Know about the fact, because cows sleep standing up, don't they? So you can push a cow over and stuff. Yeah. So they're having a wild time. Hilarious. So this time now we get to a sort of dead end in the, in the road and they say, well, turn around, let's go back to the party. And I'm thinking, fine, try and do a three point turn in this very narrow country lane, right? Get the Volvo estate wedged horizontally across the road. Can't get it out. Just can't seem to sort it out. I don't know what I'm just. I'm. Now I'm panicking because there's a pig in the car, right? And local disgruntled farmers, right? People drunk, partying, probably off their head on some kind of weed, was it? Loads of blokes with like pitchforks and flaming torches going, burn him, he's playing with our pig. Exactly that. And so that, you know, I was so terrified that all I could think was, they're gonna have to send a helicopter to lower a magnet onto the top of the car to lift the car up and put it the. You used to read a lot of comics, didn't you? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So do you know what I started doing? What? Crying. Did you really? Why? Just started crying. Just very slightly started getting upset. And the, the other guy that the girl fancied, he had to get into the driving seat and sort it out for me by slowly edging forward. That's the worst bit of the whole story. Edging slowly back and forward. He just sorted out, just slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly worked the car back round and then we were off. You're just gently weeping, just gently weeping in the back. The bloke had just taken the bird that you saw from a distance. Exactly that. Basically your wife in your head by then. Oh, yes, wasn't it? We were happily married with a pig for a child. Don't joke. That could happen. I know the pigs come if you like. Sorry, what did you say? What did you say? What did you say when you do what, Colin? What? What? What did you say then? What did you say? Because I don't want to have to go to the radio authority again. What did you say then? Just remember, just remember, we are going out live. Colin. Yeah? Remember Tom Bins, right? What did you say? What I'm saying is, why were they shouting, Vera? Because pigs don't come to the name, do they? Eh? I don't know the ins and outs of a pig. You know how to lure a pig into your trap. Can I just tell you some very, very interesting things about pigs? Please do. Right. One, they have, everyone knows they have a corkscrew shaped penis. Right? A corkscrew shaped penis. That's the tail, isn't it? Two, they can't look up. They can't put their head back and look up. Three, they can have a 30 minute orgasm. Rick, is it only pigs that have got a corkscrew shaped penis? No. And landlords. Okay, very handy. Here's one for you. Go on. Like insect facts and stuff. Go on. If a man was a flea, he. Could jump over St. Paul's Cathedral. No, wrong. It's gone up now. It's the big wheel. The big wheel. The millennium wheel. It's gone up now. It's gone up now. Play a record. You're the ash. There's a star on XFM 104.9 now. Steve? Yes. Carl text messaged me in the week. Very excited because he just watched a program that proved me and you were stupid. Remember we, we, we sort of championed the anti supernatural. Yes. Skeptical view. We're just absolutely scared about anything like that. We're, we're atheists. We don't believe in ghosts, anything like that, anything supernatural. We're, we're very, we're followers of James Randy, a genius of our times. But Carl saw something that proved us wrong. I'd like Carl to tell you what this proof was, what he saw on. And look at him go on in. It was on. It was on Wednesday night. Yeah, I was watching. You see, the problem is I didn't get the full story. So you could pick holes out of it. Sure. Unlike your usual investigations into the supernatural, which are. That's cool. Can I just say what the program's called? Mr. Exorcist? Sounds like an academic work to me. The bit that I caught, I just flicked it over seeing what's on the telly and I thought, oh, exorcist, I've seen it. But there's nothing else. And I watch it. And then I realized it wasn't the same thing. I'll have a bit of this. And there was an old woman and a daughter. And as far as I was aware, the bit I picked up on, they were saying, oh, you know, it's, it's dreadful. Unless you've been through it, you know, you've had ghosts in your house and that, you really don't know what it's like. And the main thing that seemed to be getting them down was the fact that the budgie was Getting stressed. The budgie was getting stressed because the. Animals can sense the. The other side. Okay. Can they? Yeah. Okay, so. And how was that manifesting itself? You didn't know? What was the budgie doing? I think it. It just wasn't happy. Right. Did it, did it. Did it explain that to people or how did it express that? Budgies are known for being chirpy, aren't they? I see. It wasn't chirpy. You know, it normally swings on its little perch and that. Just depressed because it was possessed. It was sat around in its, in its pajamas. So, so. No, no, no, come on, Steve, come on, Steve, you're making this a mockery. So the budget. Because he could sense the ghost. Yeah. And then. So this, this guy, this Mr. Exorcist came around. Was that his name? Yeah. Was it. Was he a priest or something? Yeah, he might have been, yep. Yeah. Did he ever. Did he have like a black coat with a little white collar? That's, that's usually the. He had his coat on, so you couldn't tell, I'm sure. Okay, but. So he came round and he sort of did his thing and. And then. Was he trying. Was he trying. Was he trying to exercise the budgie? Right, so it wasn't that the budgie had a demon. No. Okay. Now this wasn't a possession, was it? This was a straightforward. It wasn't a poltergeist or anything. It was just a haunted house. Yeah, but that's the thing he was saying. He was saying you can have like your ghouls and that, that aren't that bad, that aren't going to cause you any problems. Yeah, obviously the budgie, they've got weak hearts and haven't they? Sure. So. So he. Come on. So, so anyway, basically he sorted it out, did whatever he did, and the next shot you see is like the budgie making a noise and swinging over the moon again. And the, the old woman was like, happy because she was. She couldn't believe it. Yeah. And does. The priest didn't come in and go, well, you should feed that bird, give it a bit of millet. It was happy. He goes, right, see you later. No, it was a. I mean, budgies are. My mum's got a budgie and the, the, you know, they're fairly happy all the time, aren't they? So it's got to be something. You never see a budgie sitting down going, I feel like topping myself, to be honest. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? No. You know, you can have like moody a Moody dog. You can. You can see a dog when it's unhappy. If it's walking down the street, you. Can have a moody canary, can't you? And what they do is they often tell the police what you've been doing. They're known for that. Yeah. So basically. So that for you is proof that the supernatural exists. A bird in a cage got a little bit annoyed. Wasn't chirping as much as it normally did. Who knows why? There could have been a little draft up. It's, you know, and exactly any medical term. Anyway, a man came in and did whatever he did. Mr. Exorcist, though, Steve, this wasn't any bloke off the street. This is Mr. Exorcist. Yeah. Yeah. So you. That's the proof that there's. Just because, like, if it was a person, you go to clean up for the camera. Yeah. A budgie could possibly act like that, Steve. Yeah, I see what you mean. You say. You're saying a budgie would not be trying to. It wouldn't be trying to become famous. Not like Lassie. No. Sure. It was basically a show off. Yeah. Or champion the wonder horse. Yeah. What do you think? I think I've changed. Well, I've changed my tune. Rick. I don't know about you. I have. And I think we should play a record. I'd love to get Mr. Exorcist in. Wouldn't that be amazing? Never dabble with things you don't understand. Sorry. Like women. See what I did there? Turn that back on me, boys and girls. Girls and boys. Embarrassed yourself? Hello, girls and boys there. Steve on XFM 104.9. So it's not so bad really, because we didn't plan the thing. You know what? We've proved the supernatural. We were wrong about that. Well, I just. Just one other question. Was there anything else in this woman's house that led her to believe that there were ghosts? Or was it just the fact that, you know, Tweety or whatever his name was, wasn't chirping? You see, this is the problem. I was watching UK Style. I was watching something on that. It was, you know, it's not Changing Rooms. It's like that, but cheaper. Quite seriously. Right. You might be the most interesting man in the world. I'm fascinated by. I'd like to follow you. I'd like to have a hidden camera on you. I'd. I can ask you any question, you know, I'd like to have you in a cupboard in my flat. So I'm go. I Just think about, I wonder what Carl thinks that. And I'll just throw some at you and you'd. You know what I mean? Yeah. Because that's what my dad did. Kept me in the cupboard. You know what I mean, though? I just like. I wonder what Carl would be. You're never stuck for a conversation point if Carl's around. That's what the genius about. He's always got an opinion. He's got an opinion about everything. Yeah. I love the fact he was watching UK Style without a shadow of irony. No, that's what I like about it. I wouldn't like it if he was trying to be. No, no, no, he's not. And stuff like that. I like it because he's down the line. Straightforward, no nonsense. This is what I like. You know what I mean? He's gonna be so like Jeffrey Boycott Dicky Bird. When he's about like 60 or 70. He's gonna get on a bus and go to their. The driver somewhere. You need an aircraft. You look a scruffy get. I mean, he's gonna be a great old bloke that you need. He doesn't get chinned in the pub. Yeah, right. People protect him, you know, because he's like 70 or something. But it's great. You're looking forward. You're actually in that nod. I know. That nod went, I can't wait to be 70. Yeah. Wasn't it? Can I. Can I. Can I make a suggestion that we just get people they can email in, just questions or comments they'd like to hear from. From Carl. Maybe they just want to know his opinion on the Afghanistan situation. Yeah, Like. Or Coronation Street. Whatever. Yeah. Like they do it, you know, in the NME or. Imagine that coming up, the election. They go, billy says labor. Yeah. Son has white van man. Each day they interview a guy who drives a white van. Sees opinions on various topics. Carl is very much our white van van. White man van. Yeah. So any. Any query you have. I think most of our listeners. Any opinion that you would like to hear voiced from the K man. Ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk or you can phone in. I don't. I forget what the number is. 700-800-12-34. Sweet. Now it's time for our first regular feature of the day. That film sounds good. That film sounds good. I stopped the film reviews because I've done all the films that are nine or 10 out of 10. I don't want to drop my standards. Absolutely. This feature where it's a soundtrack of A film where I like the single from it. It might make me want to see the film. Might have seen the film. Today is our first request. Right. Interesting. This is for Martin, who wants to hear Live in the City by Stevie Wonder. And it's from Jungle Fever. Let's hear it. Well, I love the song and I love the film. Living for the City. Genius. Stevie Wonder film. Jungle Fever. Absolutely. It's a great film. Yeah. Well, not to be confused with Living in the City, which I think is a Desiree track. So you're a huge Desiree fan. We were group moving along to that. It's a great. Not my favorite Stevie Wonder track. I actually for he's Mr. Nurtle, but a great track, obviously. Wonders. Just fantastic. Anyway, and during that, we just had sound. We just like, you know, just enjoying the moment. We said, turn it up, didn't we? We liked it. Carl. Just halfway through. Just halfway through. Just looking at me. He's got a driving license. Yep. I went, well, he went, he's got a driving license. I went, as he went, yeah. Just for his own land. I went, you don't need a driver license. Viewing land. He went, you might be right. He said, who else is blind? I remember hearing something. It was someone famous, right. Who shouldn't have a driving license. Whoa. And they have. And I'm sure a lot of people. I'm sure it was someone who's blind. But you're right, it's a bit of an odd one. Don't forget. Don't forget, you haven't just. This hasn't just happened. This is in your head. So you can't say that and go, isn't that weird? How did that happen? It's in your head. Don't forget, at the moment, there is no proof. There's no proof of that. You can't say something and then go, isn't that strange? You said it. Oh, do you know what I mean? We didn't just see something happen out the window. Yeah. You know. Do you see what I'm saying? What's in your head and what happened and all that. What are you thinking? I'm just thinking, who's that other fella? Ray Charles. Yeah. Why would he have a driving license? He's blind as well. I think it's the blind thing we've got a problem with. It's the idea of people who are blind driving cars that's maybe made us question that. I mean, Stevie may have a driver's license. I very much doubt that he's passed his test. No he probably hasn't even. I mean, he could have done the theory one. Maybe. But that's a touchscreen. And until Labradors actually are allowed on the Queens Highway. Exactly. I don't think we see many blind people driving cars. I'd be wrong. You might be. Might be. Oh, we hadn't thought of that. Yeah. Oh, yes. You might be wrong. Could well be wrong. Well, there's a start. I fancy a bit of Ed Hardcore about now. Well, Rick, you've been married. Because his name's Hardcore. Yeah, yeah. Just. Just play the song, Connie. More part this. I'd be nice. Still the composite of our other features, of course, including hip Hop, Hooray. Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and love burned xfm 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. My name's Steve Merchant. It's Carl. What's your name? I press the buttons. That's it, Carl. I pressed the button. Yeah. Oh, bless him. People are loving the Cayman, aren't they? They are. People are saying they love him. He's just. Ah. I think we've created a whole new will. McDonald's? I like to think so. Yeah. Or Gordon the Gopher. I used to have a show in Manchester. You used to host a show? Yeah, overnight. What kind of things was it? What kind of stuff? What sort of tip were you on? Phone ins and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. You did a phone in? Not a proper one. What did people phone in about? No, they didn't. That was one problem. There was no phones. Go on. No, just, you know how things were going in that. Problems. Were you like an agony uncle? Kind of. That's amazing. Imagine that. Imagine sending someone to Carl. You got problems. Is it delicate? We'll go to Carl Pilkington. Hang on. This looks like maybe there's some questions. I've got a few questions here. What's the one? What's Carl's view on Carl? What do you make of nudism? Who's that? Let me just check it. That's from. There's a time and a place for it. That's from. It's very difficult. That's great. You see, there's a time and a place for it. That is just brilliant. That is Dicky bird. That's. That's that sort of northern confident sound bite. Wasn't a nudism. Time and a place for it. Would you do it, Steve? Would I do nudism? Yeah. He's not allowed. Not. Not again. No. No. Yeah. It's not nice, is it, really? It's not received. He's not allowed on any National Trust land doing it because he's caused the death of millions of starlings. There was something on BBC Choice the other night. It's a really short show. I haven't seen it before. Yeah, it's not. It's not a bloke eating cup of soup. And then another short show, like maybe someone cleaning their teeth with Colgate. And then the really short show. What was it called? What it was. It was about this old fella who ease into nudism. And he was saying he's done all right. Did he play volleyball a lot? Yeah. He said he's done all right out of it because there's not many blokes who are willing to go nude for modeling and that. And he's about 70, so it's not. Is there much crime for that, do you think? So much demand for 17. He's doing all right for it. Sure. The odd thing was, you see, he. Had a corkscrew penis. He was. It was just like walking around on the main road in like a town and. Yeah. And cars would see. That's not nudism, is it? That's mental illness. Yeah. He's just a bit. Dear. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I tell you. One of your favorite programs. Is it one of your favorite moments? Just that. That one with the hot air balloon and. It's his best. It just goes. It's like Sydney sometimes. Any set of Carnival. His favorite program, when he was little, he used to watch it for hours. Was that little girl by a black ball with two toys. Yeah, he used to love that. He enjoyed that, didn't you? Right, listen, here's something else I learned in the week. And we can use this if you want to give away the Incubus tickets. Go on. There's a problem. There's some tickets to give away later. I'll tell you about that. I'll tell you what it's like. I don't know. We're gonna receive it as a surprise. Go on, Carl. Have I ruined it? No, go on, Crack on. Yeah. There was a program about the. The body. Sure. And what. What is it? Right. Barbie doll. Why couldn't that be real? Yes. Play a record, Carl. I knew. I do know the answer, actually, I have to say. What do you mean? Why couldn't it be real If. If the Barbie doll was like a real person. Right. It wouldn't work out. I don't understand the question. If you do. This is what worries me. I don't understand. Why do you understand it? Because it's one which I've heard in the past. But so therefore, because I know the answer, the question makes sense. But unless you. Unless you know the answer, the question makes no sense. Well, of course it doesn't. That's what's brilliant. Is it worth using for the tickets, do you think? Is it that good? It's not a real question, Carl. I don't think it can't really. It can't be a real question. Well, because I. It's like one of those things about, oh, a man went into a field and died. Why you have to ask questions. You go, oh, because his parents didn't know. But. Well, I've got a million explanation. Okay. She'd be hollow. Do you know what I mean? He's right, actually, there is too vague. Why don't you give the answer and then you'll understand what. What your question meant. What was the answer? She'd have to walk around on all. Fours because no, physically, the proportions of Barbie could not be replicated on a real human woman because she just couldn't have those dimensions. Yeah, we know. Yeah, but. But that, you know, I mean. Yeah. Same goes for Fred Flintstone. Do you know what I mean? His head's half his body. It's a cartoon. Have a go at Carl. Used to came there and people love him. Sorry yourself. I'd love some hip hop, Steve. I'd like some hip hop Steve. We'll come up with question. We're giving away some Incubus tickets later. Look forward to that. It's time for hip hop. Hooray. This is from. Hey. This is from Adela Soul's 2000 album. Not the current one, Artificial Intelligence, Mosaic Thump. Yeah, they've changed a bit. They have. And a lot of people have dismissed lsl, but there's still some tracks you can dig out. But this is a Soul tip to this. This is a wonderful track. This is with me play it. Alive POD, or POD, as I call them. Yep. On XFM 104.9. A bit of rock. Who are you? I'm Ricky Gervais. Steve Merchant here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Carl, over there. Now, listen, there's a bit of rock there. Yep. Takes into a competition. We got Incubus tickets together. Incubus, you say? Now, I like Incubus, okay? I mean, for what they are. But, you know, I'm a bit worried about all this crossover, this new metal and these people coming out. They're a bit like Pearl Jam and a bit more this sort of. Oh, I'm not too sure. About it, I'm not. Still not convinced but incubus have got a bit of style about them. Well you know the, the competition we just ran there, the phone in ask kind of thing. People were phoned up, one person said what do you think about New metal, Carl? Just quick as far as went I hate it exactly. And he threw a question right back at them, went do you listen to that in the morning? Yeah. He went wow. You see in the morning I like ash. In the evening I might listen to. I think he said Magic fm. Yeah but I love the fact that he is now we've, we've put him on a pedal, he's happy with his own opinions. Before he was like don't know. And now he wants to tell the world. He'd be down Hyde Park Corner tomorrow, won't he? And they're going right, who wants to know what I think about I don't know. At 2 o'clock I will listen to the Human league. Today at 4:13 I had one apple and listened to Primal Scream. Thank you. Oh you're great bloke are we better stop now because you know we're gonna make you into the new. There'll be more from car next. But this is a very last question that someone. This is Jim, he's emailed in, he says does Carl think that the war, that Waterworld, Mad Max, Judge Dread or similar films present an accurate portrayal of what a post apocalyptic world might be like? How do you imagine what the world will be, Carl? So I've got no comment. Okay, let's forget the films. What do you think the world might be like if there was say a nuclear war and we had to survive underground for a while till all the you know, waste went away and we could come up and we could eat fruit again and oh there was all. It was all weird and we had to start from scratch. I'd rather die. Okay, okay, wouldn't you? Well supposing it was sort of like, you know, Britain was just. It was. All the buildings had gone right or there was some bit of scavenging. There was like. And we hid underground and we came out, you know, sort of in 10 years time. Don't keep shaking your head. You don't have the question. You can go no, no, no, no. Rather die and it's fine. You lived on tin fruit for a few years, right. Then you had to come up and start again. You had to. And you had to find other civilizations. I'd want that thing that is it, is it Walt Disney Ad Sort of cryogenically fridge thing and say, look, wake me up when it's all built again. I couldn't be doing with that walking around with a hard hat on all day. Yeah. What would you do? Set an alarm clock. You're the only person what you get in a fridge and even know if you find this do not disturb till 2012. You know what I mean? No. Well, yeah, but saying that wasn't. Well, I mean, what would you do first? You just come out, right, Come out into the light. It was just like. It was like, you know, Saxon Britain. There was nothing. You'd have to start again. What would you do? What would you do first? I'd probably go and see where I live now to see what's left of it. I love how he thinks. If you. If you were the last man on earth, right, and you had to have one other woman with which to start the human race again, right, and not your girlfriend, who would you start the human race again with? Which person would you. Would you want to bear in mind, it's not just like the fact that you've got kids. You've got to. They've got to be able to provide something in this world. They've got to be leaders. And they might be all melted. Exactly. So their abuse. They've just got one good eye, but now they can tell what you're thinking as a radiation. Yeah. They tried to go through a pod and there was a. There was a fish in there for some reason in their Wellington. I mean, for me, probably. What would you rather kiss, a mermaid or a unicorn? Carl quickly made. Why I want him to answer my name. He's got a lady's face. Okay then. What would you rather kiss a lady with? The body of a fish or the body of a horse? A fish on you. This is the best thing in the world. This is like. You know when you call a file a rude word and then the computer goes, do you want to open tits? You laugh because it's like. That's what playing with Carl's like. It's not like you input it and you always get. You get. You know what I mean? You sort of get. You get more back than you bargain for. Probably only because though. Because I've seen films that. That one with that Hannah Darrell or whatever her name is in and she looks alright. I've never seen it with a woman with a horse's body. Maybe if I've seen one, I might change my mind if. Okay, can you email us a picture of a woman with a horse's body. Yeah, yeah. Ricky Gervais at xfm. Or do they, do they exist? Anyway, did these record unicorns exist, Carl? No. Let's play another song then, because I think we were going to give away some Incubus tickets. We seem to have got sidetracked. Okay, well, I'd like to play my song for the lovers. I'm not ashamed of this. It's an early Bowie track. It's his, his sort of, you know, version of soul. It's off the Young Americans album. It's a beautiful song called can you hear me? David Bowie at his best there. Yeah, Young Americans. Can you hear me? You said it when the record was on, Steve. You're not gonna hear this sort of eclectic mix of music anywhere, anywhere else, Rick. We go from hip hop to soul to hip hop and soul to solely. Type hip hop and then some solely. Hip hop, hop, hop and ash. And the joy of it is, Rick, that if people are open minded enough and broad minded enough, as I hope our listeners are, yeah, they're gonna be loving this. And we play. We played early out and last week we didn't care. Ty. We don't care what he's done since or what he's like now. We're not reputation. I don't judge. I don't judge. You know what I mean? If they do a good track. Can I tell you this now? Play that track. I am not interested in what people think's cool. No, obviously. No, I'm interested in what people think is good, Rick. Yeah, yeah, all right. No, I'm interested in what we think is good. I don't care about what women think is traditionally handsome. No, I play by my own rules. Yeah, exactly. You do, don't you? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're not in it for their amusement. I'm not in this game for anyone's amusement. No, obviously not. Now all these women with the. Oh, you know, I want to be able to have a conversation. Yeah, now that was David Bowie there. We've, we've, we've played some great tracks here, but we've got more to come, haven't we? We have indeed, yes. Plenty more to come, Rick. But we're gonna give those incubus tickets. We've got accomplish now. We were talking about people keeping an open mind. Now our listeners have got open minds. They're, they're, they're like. They're not only open, they're blank. Yeah, they're, you know, really empty canvases. From the ones that have been. Yeah, yeah, but the ones that have been phoning up. I don't know. How are they dialed? No, I think they're wrong numbers or they sat on the phone or something. And a lot of old listeners are coming back. A lot of people from the old days of exam. I don't know. They're obviously been allowed out. Yeah, well, that's care in the community, Rick. Yeah, a lot of people now get the thrown out of those homes. Detox centers. Yeah, I thought maybe an old question, something I explored three years ago. What strikes me is the fact that, you know, clearly all those kind of needle exchanges and things like that, really helping people stay alive. And that's a joy. Sure. That's evidence. They're on the phone. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, what about this? Now you know the answer to this. I've done this before. Okay, Right. There is one London station. We've done this in the last couple of weeks. Oh, you think I'm gonna say St. John's Wood? Yes. No. Okay. There is one London station that has no vowels. That has no vowels. No, he's not. Oh, no. You've not thought this was one vowel. It's one vowel. It is one vowel. So there's one London station with one vowel. I can't remember the answer, though. Oh, no. This is pathetic. This is so rubbish. I so want to be on someone else's show. Like Camfield would be good. Or just on. Like Dr. Fox. We like Dr. Fox now, don't we do Fox. He's amazing. We like him. He's come through and that. Pop stars tonight. I love Fox. I like his little trunk. He's like a little trunk. And he works out and he's got a bike and everything. But I like him. He's got. He's optimistic. He wears too much blusher. And I like his suits, but it's. The fact that he's. It's like however hard he tries, he just doesn't look right on the telly. He just looks like a man who's been sewn into that suit. I know, I know. When I saw him once riding here into capital on his hog on his Harley. Oh, that's such a joy. Yeah, he's. No, we like Foxy. What about Simon Cowell? Oh, what about that? Nikki Chapman? Like her? Yeah. What about the other. Who's the other one? Oh, Waterman. Up and down. He's a bit of a normal. Wow. Come on. You can say that. But he's. He's. He's sold millions of records. None of this talking. So is our price none of this. Talking is disguising the fact that we still not managed to give those incubators. Okay, okay, okay. What about this? What about this? You got nothing, have you? No. Running on empty. Yeah. Play a record. High, is there on XFM? 104.9. Right. We've got a competition question. Steve's come up with it at the last minute. This is just to check if you are a regular listener of the show. Yeah, we would like to reward loyalty. Exactly. Absolutely. So last week on the show, Ricky described a story that happened to him back in the 80s when he was making his TV appearance on Ras Mataz with his band. And he tried to. He had to fly out. Was it to Newcastle? Yeah. And he tried to get on a plane. And a pop act of the 80s tried to help. Help Ricky sneak aboard an airplane, but failed. But they failed to do it at. The height of their power. And they were at the height of their powers. What was the name of that outfit? Should we put them on the line? Absolutely. Let's hear it. There's people there already. This is to win Incubus tickets. Please do not be mental. Don't be mental or swear or say anything libelous or nasty. Just be nice. You won't win if you're not. Go on. Hello? Hi. Who's that? Oh, I've got the headphones on. I've not got your headphones on, Rick. I'll just keep her talking. Oh, nice. Hey, how's it going? Hello? Okay. Hello. Hi there. What's your name? Lindsay. Lindsay, where are you calling from? Clapham Junction. And do you know the answer? I do. Okay. It was indeed Buck's Fizz. It was the Fizz. It was indeed the Fizz. Do you like Incubus? Yeah. Right. Yeah. You see, if I was interrogating you, I'd go. You hesitated. Yes. There's so many people phoning up who are desperate for these Incubus tickets. Please don't make. No, no, to be fair, they're rightfully yours. I tell you what, I'll have a. T shirt if you give them the tickets. Okay. Is that just any old T shirt. Or can we send her a T shirt? Carl's nodding. I think we can send you a T shirt. We'll get you a T shirt. How. How are you going to do that then, Carl? Because you've got to take her name and everything. Now. You keep talking a minute. Yeah. This is pathetic. This is amazing with Dr. Foxy. Foxy wouldn't do this. Can I. Can I say it about his bank. They're. Train station with one vowel. Yeah, but there's loads on. He hasn't thought it through. Bo as well. There's many. Listen, Carl. It can't have been that. I can't remember it. What was it? I remember I tried it the last time. I tried it and I couldn't work out. Then there was. There was wrong answers. I remember Old witch came up. Maybe it's old witch. What's. What. What's Carl doing there? Who's he talking to? I think he's talking to her, but say again. Quick. Let's think of something. Are you still on this line? No, she's picked up the phone now. So what am I doing? We're giving away. Look, we're letting people behind the curtain. Let's keep up this veneer of professionalism. This is so rubbish. Come on. No, no, no. Don't draw attention to it. Okay? All right. Let's just talk and make sense. So, Steve, what are you doing tonight? Looking forward to pop stars? I'm looking forward to a lot. Who do you want to win? I'm glad you've asked, Rick. I'd love to see Darius have a bit of success, but I don't think it's gonna happen. I think it's probably gonna be the stutterer. I think it is gonna be Gareth. He has a name there, Steve. I think it's gonna be Gareth. Yeah. Apparently in the polls in the week, he's getting twice a bit. We're back. Okay. All right, Carl. So, right. Okay. So she's getting a T shirt, is she? Lovely. Right as we go. Who's that on the line? Next contestant. Hello. This is amazing. An error. I mean, we couldn't do this worse. Hello? Hello? Hello. It's dad. Dan. Hello, Dan. Danny, do you want to go to Incubus? I'd love to, man. Okay, hold on. This is pointless because he's just heard the last. He's heard the answer. Yeah, definitely. Bucks fizz. This is mad. We didn't think this through. No, but let's be honest. He wouldn't have been on the line if he didn't know the answer. Are you cheating? Dan? Dan, he said he's not cheating. This is fail safe. That's failsafe. This is our rigorous. I can't believe. Dan, you're going to Incubus. Oh, cheers, man. Well done. Well done. Thanks for listening. Cheers. Carl. What do we have to do? Do we just hang up or what happens? No, you play a song and play a song. Randy, you've got his details. Yeah. Oh, just what is it that you want to do? We want to be free. We want to be free to do what we want to do. Feeder just today. That reminds me of this Christmas where my 51 year old brother wouldn't let anyone near the PlayStation 2 because he was playing Gran Turismo and he has to build his car up and buy it. He just played it from about 6:00 till sort of 3 in the morning. Was it bought for him or about three? I don't know, but we had to watch him. Why that song particularly? It's on it, I think Feeder feature all over it, don't they? On the soundtrack. Yeah. So there you go. Yeah. I was on the tube the other day, Rick. So I was just coming into Finsbury Finchley Road. Yeah. And I was on the train. You don't travel on the tube anymore because you're too famous. But I never did. No, no, it's not that. I don't know you recognize. It's just. It's beneath me. Fair enough. And. And they're on the tube in each carriage on these newer ones there are kind of these flaps that are normally locked closed and there was one of them that's swinging open and inside there were various buttons, like on, off, you know, self destruct, whatever, but serious, like doors operating, train quicker. Exactly. And you were thinking like, you don't want some, you know, kind of oik, sort of fiddling around, pressing buttons and stuff. It could be quite dangerous. Yeah. So I got off the finisher and I thought, I'll be a good commuter, I'll mention this to the staff and they'll probably, you know, they'll thank me for it. And if it's an attractive young staff member, you know, I mean, they never are on the tube. Have you ever seen an attractive member of staff at a tube station? They are such freaks. I mean, I know that's the pot. They're all from Devon, apparently. Grotesque people really steady aren't. And so anyway, I went up to. This guy, I thought, the uniforms don't out though, do they? They don't. It's pretty grim. And so I went up to this guy, I said to him, excuse me, I just saw on a train there, and there's a flap open. I could see all these buttons and things. He went, right. I was like, yeah, well, I just think, you know, it might be, you know, wandering hands, a small child or something, right. He went, what carriage was it? I said, well, I don't really know. What carriage it was. I just. Maybe you're the next stop. Someone should come and check. He went, well, how they're gonna check if they don't know what carriage it's in? And at that point I just thought. I just wanted to smack him in the face. I just thought, you know, I'm in a hurry, I've got no reason. There's no gain for me about telling this. It's not going to help me out in any way. Not financially, nothing. I'm just trying to help you out. And that's your attitude. I was absolutely livid. I know I'm getting so intolerant in my old days. Bad service, bad attitude, just. Oh, it drives me mad. It makes my blood boil. And I was. One time, I was down in the center of town. This was after some of the big explosions, the ira, you know, various things. And everyone was on kind of bomb alert. Very nervous, very scared. And there was a sort of a bag in the street. You know, this was the center of London or whatever. And my friends and I were a bit edgy, but a bit nervous. And we're outside this pub, we saw the bag and we thought maybe we should sort of tell. We'll tell the landlord on that. So we told the landlord, right? And he came out and he looked at it, he thought, oh, you're right, lads, it does look a bit shifty. And this is what he did. This was his security measure, Right. He was going to call the police, but in the meantime, he picked up one of those sandwich boards that advertises what food's being served in the pub. Just placed it over the top of it. Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's fail. That is what the bomb disposal unit use very often, that you see them up and down Oxford Street. They're not people, you know, selling stuff. Sure. That's just. They will leap on a bomb. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I love the idea because what we did was we. We moved about 100 yards down the road because we thought if the bomb goes off, we want to see it. That'll be dramatic. Yeah. We don't want to get. I love the idea of like a sandwich board flying off into the air, just embedding itself in someone's head. Yeah. No one would have been here. Who do I see that sandwich for? That was. That was Ron, the landlord. Exactly, yeah. My God, is that. Is that. Is that Cumberland pie for 5.95? I can't believe I. Luck, John. I think there's something more serious anyway. Paramedics going, I Can't not even be a pie. I'm gonna come back here. So anyway, so listen, he calls the police, right? And so after a while about, you know, it's like 40min. And I think the police do a good job. I'm not trying to be down on the police, I think it's a good job and I respect the police. But this police van turns up after about 40 minutes of waiting, right? And this guy leaps out of the van and he goes, what, you're the guys who reported this, are you? And we went, yeah. He went, right, and he looked at the bag and he picked it up, he unzipped it and there was just some rubbish in there and he just looked, he just threw it at us. He went, there's your bomb for you, and threw it at us to teach us a lesson. And then got in the van and drove off and it was like, what lesson are you teaching us about being. Presumably reporting him? Of course we're not wasking at him, you know, it's not. Do you know what I think? Think? I think he thought it was a bomb and he was trying to blow you up to teach you a lesson. Well, possibly. That's bad. That is really bad. It just winds me right up, stuff like that. Me and Bill, where we had sort of. It was like 1983 and we had like extensions and cut off T shirts and jeans and sexy. Yeah, you know, like make. Oh, no. And we're just eating chips on the corner and this. It was a Saturday, so I assume it was like football patrol. About 12 police in the car and they sort of slowed down, looked at us and he wound the window down and the bloke driving shouted, you look like a couple of prats. Bill turned to me and went, is that an offence? And I remember wanting to laugh at the joke, but thinking, that's annoying. Yeah, they were right. No, they were right. It's not really a police issue. I don't think someone called into HQ that morning. Guys, if you see anyone looks a bit, you know, the fashion police. We've heard a bit. There's a bit of a to do. Apparently a couple of prats are walking around. Yeah. We need someone to go on fashion police patrol. Send in Lawrence Llewellyn Bowen. Oh, dear. But you know, we respect the police. I'm not having a ghost, just those few that give him a bad name, really. Yeah, exactly. My favourite. I think the boys in blue do. A good job and do the fireworks. Yeah. Especially farming. I remember once. This is really embarrassing, this is the arrogance of youth. Right. In a hall of residence, every time someone did toast, the fire alarms went off. And once it was like two in the morning and we were at the Gartside and it was just toast south things, but it was linked. And about eight fire engines turned up and I. They're all coming in, right? And I said, oh, this is so embarrassing. Why am I telling this? Go on. I just went, there's enough of you, God and the fireman. Right? When I said, he just went, shut your mouth, man. And I thought, oh, God, he's right. He's one of these. You remember ten years later. Yeah, That's a horrible thing. What? I know. But I publicly apologize. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Because I never did stuff like that. Oh, that is twice. I was too busy saying, can I try on your helmet? Oh, dear. Oh, we better play another song. Oh, this is a great track. This is Groove Armada. It's from the album Goodbye country, hello Nightclub. It's the opening track. It's all called Sun Touch. I think you'll like this, Steve. Well, I'm looking forward to it. Groove Armada there and Sun Touches. You like that. I didn't mind, actually. I didn't realize you were a Groove Armada dance music fan. Well, no, Jane played that before. I knew that before. But I loved it immediately. Oh, it's great. It's like soundtrack mixed with a little bit of. Sure, sure. Hip hop and. Oh, it's all. It's all like a big. All a big mixing pot. Yeah, yeah. I just wish that's what the world was really. Everyone could live in harmony. I wish it was an onion. Oh, if only the world were great. Big onion. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, well, maybe one day. Well, this is nearly the end of the show. It's been Ricky Gervais on XFM 104.9 with Carl, and it's been a great show. And, you know, I've just. There's been some laughter, there's been some tears, there's been some jokes, there's been some political satire. I like to think so. But above all, there's been some chat. With friends and there's been some bloody great music. Let's get there. I don't think we need to swear at this time. Play juncture. Yeah, because you make yourself look a and me look a twat and Carl look like a complete song for ladies. Rarely do you get a chance to play on a radio station. Wanker. Seven minutes worth of Led Zeppelin, but screw it. I thought hey, you know it's the end of the show. We don't give a damn. It's an amazing with the language. Screw dumb and bloody do not a sermon make. Really, it's a beautiful song. If you're not a Zeppelin fan, stick with it. It's not roaring rock as you'd expect. The Rain Song from Houses of the Holy. See you next time. See you later.",
