  "text": "The Flaming Lips. Yoshimi battles the Pink Robots on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me is Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Good morning. I'm gonna be honest, I'm gonna own up straight away. I've done very little work towards this show this week. Surprised me. Yeah. Yeah. So I apologize if it sounds a bit sort of. Thanks for being honest, though. Well, no, I don't, you know, I don't want people to go, oh, that was a bit shoddy this week. I hope it's gonna be that every week. So it is, because I've done very little preparation. Okay. So. Right. You know, normally you'll probably have to help me out. All right. You have to do some of the. Some of the work. Carl, you might have to help us out a little bit as well. I don't know. I mean, I don't know. Steve's done nothing towards it either. So the onus is on you a little bit here. I love the fact that it's still listed as either Ricky Gervais or Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. And, you know, essentially, we don't need. To be here, really. No, I know. Now, people listen for Carl, everyone. I've spoken to people on buses, to comedians like Ross Noble, mentioned you the other day and that, you know, they. Go, people on buses? I've never been on a bus. You haven't been on a bus for, like, 12 years, have you? People on buses. I don't know why I find that so funny. I just know being on a bus, the idea of you landing on your. Bus, they're shouting out from the window. They're going, I love Carl. Right. I'm walking along. How much is it on the bus? 20 pence. Come on, seriously, how much is it? 11 adult determiners, please. I love the fact, you know, they do that thing where, like, if they're interviewing, what is it? Paul Newman or someone famous, they always say, how much is a pint of milk? And that's supposed to prove if you're sort of still in touch with your roots or whether you're too big a celebrity. Yeah. You've got no idea how much it costs on the bus. It's not quid. 120. No, it's not 120 pint of milk. About 50p. 30p. Oh, brilliant. I mean, it's fascinating because you gave this stuff. I mean, you gave this stuff up before you became the celebrity, didn't you? You were always amazing because people always say, to me, like, oh, you know, Ricky seems a bit obnoxious. Who says that? They say, you know. Who comes up to you and just says that? The guy on the tube did it. I said again. He came up. He said, I was watching an interview with Ricky. He said, he's not a nice piece of work. I went, well, I mean, he said, no, I've got friends like that, you know, just. And it's like they're always talking, they're a bit irritating, you know, and you sort of let them off. Cause they're your mates. But I was going, well, hang on a minute. He went, two things. You know, it's sort of my job, talking and being interviewed, essentially. You do have to talk. Yeah. About yourself. If that's his only criticism, then I'm not too bad. No, he didn't think you were funny either. In fact, he had a whole list. Well, I say a list of petition. It wasn't Dickie Anderson, was it? It wasn't Richard Anderson. I hope he's listening. He's our biggest fan. I'll tell you what. Mock Turtles need a remix by Fat Boy Slim, don't they? Mock Turtles. It's a great tune, but I'd love to hear it remixed. Ye turtles. Can you dig it? Remixed by slim. Yeah, yeah. Xfm 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Ooh, stuff. Stuff to do. Talk about and that. What's been going on? Oh, before you came in. Oh, you saw it, didn't you? That experiment I was doing with the. An experiment? Yeah. Well, all I know is, as I walked in the building, I passed the little kitchen area. You were hitting Carl on the head with a tin tray. Didn't it make a good noise? It was a great noise. But I interested. Explain more about the experiment. Well, I wanted to see how hard I could hit him and make it resonate. Right before either caved his skull in or. You know what I mean. So you had to hold it quite loose so it could like vibrate. But you had to grip it hard enough to give it a good whack. And his head's brilliant for hitting stuff on. He wouldn't. It is perfect. We recreate that moment a bit later on the radio. You'll notice that you've been on for 15 minutes, haven't said a word. Just had a bit of an effect on me. Still a little bit shaken. Okay. Oh, dear. But yeah, do it again later. We were talking about your head a little bit earlier, weren't we? It's not going to mean that you're sort of a bit, you know, fuzzy thinking, is it? Yeah. Can we recreate that later? Maybe towards the end of the show? Just hit you on the head with various objects, see which make the best sound. Talking about timeout. I said something about in timeout. And he went, yeah, do you read that? I went, yeah, yeah, I read it every week. Yeah. He went, there's no point, though, is it? Because it's like a telephone directory, you know, if you want to look something up, you look it up. But you'd never sort of browse the telephone directory. And I went, that's an interesting point. He went, although I did, when I was in Scotland, I just looked up how many Macs there were and there was 42 pages of them. How bored are you in your hotel room in Scotland to suddenly start working out how many people start with Max? Did you. Were you sat in your room? There is nothing else that you can think of? It's been working. It's when we did the show from, you know, XFN did some stuff from Edinburgh. Yeah. He was in the hotel room. Sat in the room, waiting to sort of go out and get some food and that. Sat there. Why were you waiting to go out and get some food? We're gonna meet up. We're gonna meet up with, you know. So I'm not going to switch the TV on. I'm not going to read a message. Until he was on. Nothing was on. I wasn't impressed with anything that was on. So I'm looking around the room. I had a couple of the free shortbreads. I know the fact he remembers. He remembers a specific biscuit he had. Yeah, that's fantastic. Had a couple of them and then looked around. There was a Bible and I thought, well, I know about that. Yeah, there's nothing in that. I don't know. So got the phone book up and immediately thought, there's a lot of Mac this and Mac that in Scotland. Macintosh, MacDaddy's, McAteer. There's loads of names. So I thought, I wonder how popular it is. 42 pages of max. Did you count how many pages there were? Yeah. Did you just work out from the numbers on the bottom of the page. Or did you literally counted and how. Many do you reckon are on a page? There's a lot in there. If someone could turn in approximately how many times they get on one page. How long did it take you, this whole procedure? What, the counting? Not that long. Two pages. Once you digested that information, What. What did you do with that information? Did you tell. Stored it. I mean, look, how long ago was the Edinburgh Festival? I stored it along with the Biscuit. I love to get in his head. I imagine it's a big warehouse and there's lots of partitions for weird stuff, like kids born with tentacles and things like that. I imagine there's like quite an old caretaker and you go in there, you say, I'm looking for. He goes, hang on, hang on, I know where that. I put that somewhere. Is this the one when they shave the cat? No, it's not shaving the cat. This is the max. The max. I know Scotland. The shortbread. Well, don't give me the shortbread. Cause that's putting me off. But what's her name, though? Do you remember last week I was talking about the airy kid and I. Think that's every week, Carl. That doesn't narrow it down. All right, well, we're talking about that area. Kid in the woods and did a bit more research this week, okay. Found a good story out about a monkey, right. Which I'll tell Ricky a little bit about it. Tell me. Come on, tell it now. It sounds exciting stuff. That's got them, right, so we'll be doing that. We've got. We've got Rockbusters again this week. Yeah, we've got. Do we need them? Yeah. What are you trying to get rid of this week? Cockroaches. Right. I can't think of a reason to. Keep them looking into that. Well, sort the matter out. That's coming up. We've got. I'm teaching you some more stuff. Oh, yeah? Yeah. He phoned me up today. Yesterday. It was, you know, he's been researching, like, Educating Ricky. He said, what do you want to know about? I said, you interested in space? And I went, yep, yeah. Phones me. Three hours later. He went, no, nothing about space. I mean, what? He said, I couldn't find anything interesting. I said, you couldn't find anything interesting about space? Yeah, it's big. It's pretty interesting. It's big, but there's nothing there. It's like the Millennium Dome. So what I'm looking at, right? But no way. He said, is there anything else you want to know about? I went, all right. I went, anthropology. He went, what's that? I went, study of man. I sent a man. He went, like what? I went, like our roots from. From caveman through and all that. He went. And I said, australopithecus, Neanderthal. He went, we know all that. Then I went, no, right. He went, don't know how a lung works or something. Our lung works. And I said, well, tell me how fridge works. He went, oh. I said, it's just the gas in it. I went, brilliant. I went to our microwave works, but I know. And I said, fellow walking past in a laboratory with a bar of chocolate in his pocket went past some sort of ray thing, it melted it and he went, hold on, that's it. That's. That's explained to me how a microwave works. Right. So today we're doing sort of medical ish type things under the banner of colon, then educate me. Oh, God, do it again. Colon, then educate me. Brilliant, brilliant. So that's like. Go on then. So colon. So that's a little heading. You're going to be learning three things, sort of medical ish before 3:00. Yeah. Is that it? Yeah. Do you want to. Pretty much, yeah. A bit of Suede. How many O'Reilly's are there, do you think? Suede Animal Nitrate has really got a Johnny Mar influence at the end, that guitar? Yeah, still brilliant. Xfm 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Tell us about this monkey, Carl. You're gonna love this one, Steve. Right, yeah. So last week we were talking about how, like, a lad left his family because there's problems at home and that. He went and lived in the ward. He got airy. No, leave it there. We haven't got time to go. Right, so that's what happened. And that's what happened. He lived with the monkeys. He went airy. That's what happened. Looked into some other stuff about, like, airy kids and all that. Came across this story about a bloke, right, who worked in a zoo. Oh, dear. Right. So troubles brewing. Loving his job in that, but it's quite a lonely sort of job because you don't see many people. You're just dealing with animals all the time. Right. So anyway, he gets a bit pally with a monkey because it's the closest thing to a human. Well, that ape is. Right, yeah. But you can't really go that close to apes. What do you mean? What type was it? Was it a chimpanzee? I reckon it was a chimp. Yeah. Yeah. I don't even know. Yeah, but it doesn't matter. So he gets pally with him. Right, so he gets pally with him together. Well, no, I mean, it starts off. Starts off just checking each other out and, you know, probably sharing lunch and that together. Yeah. Right. Anyway, this goes on for a while is. You know, they're getting on well on that. And then after a while, right, the monkey starts sort of imitating him a bit more and sort of walking upright. Oh, God. Yeah. Right. So he thinks, oh, that's a bit weird. Anyway, they get on really better and what have you. So he thinks he could. He could live at home with me. This. Yeah, we're getting on the storm. Yeah. Right. So he takes him home and before. Beginning of Beneath the Planet of the Apes, I think it is. I think you've seen this on video. I'm worried because he's already imitating him when they're moving in together. I'm thinking it's maybe like single white female. Single white zookeeper. Oh, brilliant. So anyway, so it's moving in and it's getting used to sort of the. The normal human life. He's having a cup of tea in the morning. Yeah. PG Tips as a. It finishes the day off. Finish the day off with what? It does move a piano at one point. Finishes the day off with a little brandy. He pours himself. Is he wearing a smoky jacket? I'll tell you what, Carl, you. You're a maniac. Now, this is. This is why it attracted me. It's amazing. Right, so he's having his brandy and that, loving his life. Next thing you know, he sort of. I don't know if he loses it or he gets shaved, but the top half of his body is hairless. Hairless. Right. Apart from his head. Right. So he's got a nice. The opposite of the kid. Yeah, that would happen. Right, hang on. But. So you don't know if he shaved or if. How did it say, then the. They're hairless. What? What? I'll bring it in for you, the story, and then you can see if I. Come on. So anyway, so. So this is going on and he's having a great life. Then the zookeeper starts getting a bit annoyed because he's having a better life than the zookeeper. The zookeeper's in the zoo. This is such. So the zookeeper's still got to do a day's work. The monkeys at home, he's partying. There's no point you coming in to the zoo, because the whole reason of you being there was because you're being kept there. Right. And he didn't want to bring the memories back, so he said, you stay at home. You are. You're talking such. Just let him finish. God, I don't know if. Sit here and listen to this dribble. Let me. Oh, I'm fascinating. It's nearly over anyway. It sounds extraordinary. So he's walking upright. He's having a tea in the morning, finishing the day off with brandy. Gets a bit out of hand. Only tries it on with the zookeeper's wife. Make him go away. How does he do that? Well, because he's around humans a lot, he becomes a bit of a charmer. But what is it that he could do to seduce her? Pick fleas out of her? He didn't say. He's built. He was built. Yeah. He's well known. What about that? What do you mean, what about it, Carl? It's obviously not true. It's obviously not true. This wasn't on the Internet. This was in a book. So it's not a quick joke and just put it on a website. This is in a book. I don't understand how. I love how he becomes a charmer. He's got better taste in brandy. And he. Ah. What was it that he was doing that seduced her? I don't know. Maybe because he was at home more than the zookeeper was. But what would he be doing, pal? He's not gonna be talking with her. They're not gonna be playing Trivia Pursuit. Maybe. Maybe she liked the silent type. It didn't go into that. He just said that's when the trouble started. Is that what Suzanne did when she. Brought you in, talking to the Sunburst yesterday day? It's just the way I'm feeling Feeder. Just the way I'm feeling. XFM 104.9. I love that. Carl, you're. You're. You're panicking. You've just remembered a song from your childhood. And I don't know what you're talking about, but I'm gonna give out a number. Please take this number down if you can help. Carl. It's 087-00-800-1234. Right. I'm not. I'm not that bothered. We were talking about a track from the 60s. Yeah. Mighty Quinn. Yeah. And it was on the same compilation. My dad had a tape in the car and the tape was always on in the. In the stereo thing in the car. And I used to sit, sort of sit through all this stuff I didn't like. But knowing that coming up soon was a song about a monster with purple eyes. It wasn't. Wasn't that a monster? There must be something else about it. Do you remember a course or a few lines? It says something like. It was a One Eyed. It had big eyes, purple. And it eats people or something. The Big Eyed Purple Eater. Wasn't there a song called something like that? The Big Eye Purple. I'm sure there was a song which is something like the Intergalactic Purple Ear or something. It's some like. It's a novelty song. Rubbish. What, by the Bonzo? That sort of thing. Yeah, I'm sure. You know what? Can't look, the telephones have gone mad. Yeah, well, find out in a bit. I mean, I'm not that bothered. I'm not gonna buy it. It's just that we were talking about songs and that. It'll be good to know. It was, but. Yeah, right. Rockbusters. Okay, now, how long. Where did you get the phone? What? Do you want to just answer? Just see if someone's. Hello? Hello, mate. All right? Yeah. That song. I don't know it's by or. Is that what you want? That's the bit I want. What's the name of the song? The way you know how it goes. It's like. Oh, yeah, sorry. I don't think you've helped much, though. You can't remember what it's called or who it's by? Well, no, I mean, I know the tune, but that's about it. But he's done well. He's done well. He's given up his spare time to call in and sing us a song. Don't diss him, Rick. I'm concerned he's just only marginally remembering it more than Carly. It was actually in. I think it was in the Blob. No, it wasn't in something like the Blob, actually. I think Steve McQueen was driving away and it was running in a sequence. This seems so very familiar. See if it. Thanks very much, mate. See if we can get a title off someone. Hello? Yeah, I know the name of that shoe. Go on. Was it the Purple Eyed People Eater? Yeah, that sounds about right. Yeah, well, I'll just. I'm just at work. And who is it by? Came to my mind. Do you know who's by? I don't know who it's by, mate. Sorry, there's not enough information. I wouldn't phone anybody, but we asked him just what the June was. I want someone like Paul Gambuccini to call it. He knows what, you know, what chart position it got. Okay, Right. This is enough information. That's two people. If you know the title, we can put it in the Internet, can't we, and find out who did it. Yeah, that's Full of brilliant. Thank. Thank you very much. I don't know why they bothered. No, I mean I just think if you're going to bother to call in a radio station. You have the facts. Do you have. He hasn't got the facts and he runs the radio station. He doesn't run it. They keep him here like a mascot. He's like a pet, isn't he? They have running around the office. God. Now listen, it's Rockbusters. I've got the. The prizes here, Rick. I'll be honest with you. I mean we've given away some. Some shoddy stuff in the past. This is the worst collection. This is really scraping the bottom of the barrel, Carl. I mean there's on the phone. If you're still voting, hang up because we. We're not going to bother anymore. We really sorry about that. Maybe email us or something. How many of these can we give away? Look at that. It's only. Only Fools and Horses. It's a Christmas special from. Not this year, the year before. Yeah. I mean we have given away so many of these. I imagine there's charity shops throughout London throw. So we got that. And you know, if you didn't watch it, you know if you weren't watching. It was 20 million that watched. Blue eyed, fat legged, purpley A people. It's something like that. Once again, the best chill out album ever with. I mean this pretty much rubbish. It was a big boo boo actually. No, the songs are okay. It's just basically a collection of songs you might have heard on adverts. So enjoy that. Oh God. This one again, the best air guitar album in the World, Volume 2. This is no longer an entertainment show. This is three people chatting to each other now and again. Sometimes we remember it's going out. Sometimes we just take a call for an amusement. I mean. It'S the same place again. It's the David attenborough compilation of DVDs, which I'd be very surprised if actually makes it to you. I imagine someone here will have had that long before we post it. Oh dear. There's a T shirt in here. SSM 104.9. You get sent a lot of crap. In case you're wondering what you're listening to. This is a quick silver T shirt. What is that? What T shirt is that? That's a T shirt made by the Quicksilver people. So if you're a bit of a surfer dude and by the look of the size of it, you're a midget. You can't say Midget. You're welcome to it. And this is, I think, the piece de resistance, Rick. I mean, because, you know, the kind of fans we have, they're pretty cool cats, pretty groovy guys. Yeah. Yeah. So I imagine they'll be loving on dvd. Doctor who, The Aztecs. That's one of William Hartnell, the first Doctor's classic episodes on DVD there. Oh, you know. Rubbish. That's rubbish, Carl. I'm ashamed to give them away, Carl. You know, I mate Johnny, he's a Doctor who fan. Yeah. Do you remember he bought the Doctor who magazine and he went to the toilet and Steve got post notes and put Geek on every page. And Johnny opened it on the tube, right? And it had Geek and everything. And Johnny bought in the new Doctor who magazine, I think, this week. So this month. Right. And they've. They've. They've done the perfect Doctor who fan, right? What? The geek is right. And it looks exactly like Steve. All right. Don't have a go. It does anybody. I'm gonna try and put it on the website. It's amazing. It's got your hair, glasses, it stands like you, it's sort of dressed like you and it's only. It's. It's hilarious. And he's. He's. It was. I mean, I'm insulting you now. It sounds like an insult, but if you'd see it, you'd laugh. Player. Well, Rockbusters. Right, yeah. All right, here we go. Just a little bit annoyed. Just three clues. I can't get over that insult. I'm just a little. No, he did that. I wasn't expecting an insult. No, there was a sense of camaraderie on this. Just email in ricky.gervaisa xfm.co.uk what are we doing? I'm just. I'm just reading out the clues. Should we put this. Let's put this one in for the Sony Award. Let's put this show in for the Sony Awards. Play a song, Carl, because I need to discuss things with him. I've talked before about. Get this down to three minutes. It'd be a great Busters in a minute. By Bruce Springsteen from his new album The Rising on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gerras, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington, former, just phoned in and said to Carl, stick up for yourself. Don't listen to that Merchant. He does my Eddie and he's so arrogant. I don't think I'm arrogant. I think I'm mean. Yeah, just think I'm sort of Objectionable. I don't think it's arrogance. I think sort of nastiness. Yeah. I'm just not a very nice person. But I'm not arrogant. I think I'm pathetic. We've had a lot of emails saying, could you bring back White Van Karl? Which is that section of the show where we ask the questions that the. Sun asks someone else. Random punters of Carl. But sadly, recently they got very politicized and very kind of basically a little bit depressing. So there's not really anything appropriate. But I have trawled the papers looking for other questions posed in other sections of the Sun. Good idea. I was just looking here at the Dear Deirdre section, which is the sort of problem page. I don't know what your views are. I love to see Carl. Oh, God, can we get him a job? Oh, my God, that would be amazing. Right, well, here's one I'd like to see your view on this, Carl. I'm a happy, married, 42 year old woman with four kids. Yeah. I've developed a huge crush on pop star Darius Dinesh. Yeah. It sent my hormone levels through the roof. And last night I woke my husband up at 4am for sex. We've been married for 20 years and he can't believe his luck. Recently I've been having. Sorry, I want to go to a. I'll stop you there. You telling me? Carry on. Sorry. Recently I've been having erotic thoughts about Darius morning, noon and night. I haven't felt like this since I was a teenager and mad about Donny Osmond. My husband is amazed at the change in me. We had sex twice last night and again this morning. Again. Why are you telling me this? Yeah, go on. He's just boasting. This is not a problem. It's not a problem. What's the problem? No problem. Just wanted to tell someone. Thanks very much. I watched Darius on TV last night and when my husband came home, I dragged him into the kitchen and we made mad, passionate love. Right, They've done it. They did it then twice last night, once this morning. That's four times. Five. The five times she's mentioned it so far. Yeah, she's doing all right. My husband. This is a great bit. My husband thinks it might be his new moustache or that I'm going through the menopause. Are you thinking of growing a moustache? You think you'll change it up with the ladies? I love the idea. That's what he thinks is he's telling he's mate in the pub, she. 5 times in the last 24 hours. Hooray for sexy Darius. So what do you make of that, then? What? What? Your views on that. Hold on, though. If that bloke is reading that paper, that narrows it down. Who else did he know? His wife likes Darius, he's had sex five times and he grew a new mustache. He's thinking, I wonder if that's. I wonder if that's me. Maureen. Yeah, go on. But what's your concern? Because she. I'll tell you what her problem is. She's worried that, you know, the reason that she's now kind of overly excited and she's having these great sex with her husband is because she's actually fantasizing about someone completely different, younger. She's having these wayward thoughts, isn't she's a bit concerned about that. What's she considered? What are your thoughts? I reckon she's going to start shoplifting soon and coming out and not flushes. Go on, Just. They're both happy, aren't they? He's getting what he wants, she's happy. I'd say, yeah, whatever, get on with it. Do you think that she could confess she wants to be honest with him? I. I wouldn't because not. Not that many fellas like Darius. Right, so if you're sort of thinking, or she'd rather have him than me. What do you think Darius would think of this? He's probably be happy with that. I mean, what would you do if. You got loads of phone calls, right, from women going, carl, whenever you're on the radio, I just have to do it. I just have to do it. Your voice makes me. I'll say, all right, well, you know, it's all right. I'll be happy with that. Yeah. Just in case anyone is doing that. What would you do to sort of like egg them on a little bit? 12 man. What do you think? What sexy things would you say? What do you think is your quality? What do you think people would find, you know, pretty horny about you? Is it your sort of mank wine? Do you think that just. Just say this. London, innit? I say that, but, you know, London, it's not that good, is it? Oh, I think you've done it there. So. So that's. Say something quite sort of sexy, though. Say something like, you know, I love to love you. Say something's answers to me, you know, do you love me? I go, yeah, you're all right. I know that's true. Yeah, I know that's true. That's brilliant, but because one of the. Things that Deidre says is that she's wondering if this marriage is going a little bit stale and needs to be freshened up. They need to give a new spice, a new spin to the marriage. What would you do? What advice would you give to spice up? You know, something that they've been married for quite some time. Get them. Get them. I think get Darius, all Darius things. Get David Sneddon's new video on the telly. What do you reckon, though, Carl? Just. Just treat them. Do you know what I mean? Just surprise them now and again with stuff. That's what I do. That's what. You got those condoms, didn't you? That you got two. Hang on. What? You've never done that. What? You've surprised Suzanne with what? You know, I've. Like you stood behind the door and. Shouting out. Don'T drop the jelly. You know, just. Just the usual stuff. There was some free chocolate delivered to work the other day. I took her a bit of that home. Nice of you. That's pretty thoughtful. She didn't like dark chocolate, but I said, well, it's a thought. So I had it. But, you know, you often benefit from any gift that you give her. The chocolate, the meal, the condoms. There's always something in it for you. Yeah, there is. I love the idea. She's got bored with a Christmas present now, though. Pop the condom. Yeah. Or the food that she ate. Yeah. She's got tired of filling them with water, throwing them at the passing kids or putting them on her head and inflating them. I love the idea of asking problems, what do you think of erectile problems? You know that Pele advert? He goes, be careful, we haven't got erectile problems. Call this number. What would you do if you're impotent? What would you do? What's the advertising? Just saying, like, you know, if you. Can'T, you know, I haven't seen that. Why have they got him doing it? Wow. Well, you know, he used to be able to keep it up for hours, the ball. And what would you do if you. To advertise that? No. If you suddenly couldn't get, you know, what would you do? I don't think it bothered me. Now I know you're 30, you're talking. Like you're an 80 year old. Yeah. But do you know what I mean? You sort of been there, done that. Now it's like the boxing and the dancing that I did, it was good as a kid and now it's like Take it and leave it. You need to write to Deirdre. Super Grass. Seeing the light. Xfm 104.9. We're a little bit worried we might have a technical hitch here. We've had no emails and usually we get loads and loads, so we're worried it's us. Can someone send an email? Well, yeah, just a test email. Yeah, but we won't know if they have or not. They might just be ignoring us. No one might be listening, Steve, so this isn't proof. I guarantee there's at least one person who would send an email. Maybe if Dickie Anderson's listening, he could do it for us. Anders. Anders, do us a favor for all the pleasure we've given you over the last few years. Ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk. The Rockbusters might as well give them out. Well, let's check the email's working before we do that. Yeah. Otherwise it's a complete. This whole show has been a sham and a farce and a waste of time. Well, I think they can take that as. Greg. Right, educate me, Carl. Right, well, educate me. Well, what we. What we're looking at this week, we've. We've done war. We've done that. We've nailed war. Did we summed up war with a. Little French bloke whose battle cry was John's got a moustache. Right, so. And last week we did science. What would you. On science? Enough Airy kid. Brilliant. Right, yeah. So this week we're looking at medical problems. I'm sure we do. Area kid. Every week. Medical problems. And I've got. I've got a couple of things under the banner of colon. Then educate me. Yeah, we've got. This is interesting, right. Do you know if you have an operation on your brain, right, what they do is the. I mean, this is why I'd never go to the doctors. I don't like doctors because this sort of stuff freaks me out. Right. They can operate on your brain and what they do is they put you to sleep first, cut your brain case. Open. Your brain case. Yeah, yeah. And then wake you up and operate on you. So you sat there with your head open. Yeah. Messing with your brain and you don't feel anything. There's no nerve endings, is there, in the brain? But still it's not right, is it? What, you think they do it for fun? No. Go on, Reggie, wake him up so he looks freaked out. Is it necessary that you're awake, do you think, or. Well, they need the brain Active, don't they? Yeah, but it is when you're asleep, you're having mad dreams. I had a mad dream the other day. No, I might tell you about it later, but there's no sense to it. But. So your brain's still. Your brain. Where is this conversation? Yeah, I mean, it'll turn out. I go, no, Carl, I was there. That wasn't a dream. Yeah. No. What. So, I mean, if I had an. Operation on your brain, Heaven forbid. Operation. Anyway, I'd like to sort of think, well, I'll have an injection, I'll go asleep, but when I wake up, it'll all be sorted. Yeah. The fact that your brain case is open. Open. And they wake you up and you think, oh, is it all done? They say, well, have a look in the mirror and you. And you see, I don't think I do that. I don't think they try and frighten you when you're doing an operation. Yeah, I don't think that you go about your business and they sort of follow you around dabbling. Yeah. No, but it's almost like they are having a bit of a laugh with you. Right. Well, I just like to say now that they don't. Anyone who's going in for an operation on their head, do not ever listen to anything. Why have you got to be awake? Because you'll be bored anyway. You'll be sat there. They give you a telephone directory. Look. And they say, look how many Macs are in there. That's the Scottish telephone directory. And you know, time flies when you're counting that sort of thing. No, but you know, like, when you. What are you. What are you telling me? What you are saying? How weird it is. It's weird. And it's like, do you know when you go for haircut? Right. It's a bit embarrassing. Well, I don't anymore. But when you go for haircut, it used to be. When you go for a haircut, it. Used to be a bit embarrassing when, like, they'd wet your hair and they'd make you have that sort of Hitler cut because your hair's wet. And I used to hate it. And I think, do you have to do that? Do you know what I mean? You know what I mean? It's very similar to open skull. What I'm saying is, it's almost like barbers like to do that to make you look daft and feel daft for a bit. And there's women coming in and out and you're sat there with a daft haircut. Yeah. And this is what that reminds me of. Do you think that. Do you think they do it in a shop window, this brain operation? I'm just saying it's a bit weird. Why are we doing it in John Lewis's? Just so more people love the idea. That that's what doctors are doing. Let's make this guy look a bit stupid. Yeah? Open his brain. Look at the twaty look for this brain out of his head. Take a Polaroid Red. Look at him. Look at his face, right? Like clock his face. When I give him the mirror. Get this on camera. Put his fake nose in glass. Did you teach me something, then? I taught you that your brain. Your brain case can be open with your awake. And you just sat there sort of letting them get on with it. Brilliant. I've learned that. I'll never forget that. Right, go on. Anything else you'll love? Let's play a song because the next one is amazing. What, even more amazing than that? Yeah, play a song. Yeah. Bit of Bowie. No. Email still, by the way. No, I don't think it's working. It's not working. We'll have to do a phone in. For Rockbusters off the Ziggy Stardust album. All right. Bit of David Bowie. When's that ever anyone, Steve? Never. Lady Stardust off Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars on XFM 104.9. I'm looking Gervais. Steve Merchant. Carl Pilkington is in the middle of Educating Me colon. Then educate me. Right, so I've learned that you can, you know, fiddle around with your brain when awake. That's brilliant. I've never been a fan of doctors, though, so this was a good one for me to look up because. Yeah. Did I tell you the time when the doctor said I was gonna die? All right, keep talking. Right. Ages ago. Wasn't about 15. Right. And at lunchtime there was this. We used to have a choice of stuff to do at lunchtime, right? Used to have like a. Like a burger place that had an arcade machine in it, right? So we used to go there and play on that and have a burger. Or there was this baker's, right, that my mum worked at and did great cakes and stuff, right? So she used to, like, bring some home and that, but she couldn't always bring them home every night because, you know, they cost money and she used to get them for free and they used to say they'd rather chuck them away than give them to the staff because there's a chance that the Cream might be off. Right, right. So they used to chuck them around the back. So I used to go around the back with me mate and eat alone. Brilliant. Scavengers are eating out of bins. No, it was really, it wasn't out of bins, they were still in trays, but they just stacked them up near the bins. Right, so this got out, I mean it used to be chocker. Once the school found out, everybody used to go there and it'd be like, well, have a cake. Fighting the kids off. So I'd have, you know, you just eat, I don't know, six jam donuts or something and then you'd spend your dinner money on the arcade machine. Brilliant. Right, so it was a good, good afternoon, really. Right, so you do that. And this one day I must have had six or seven jam doughnuts. Few congress tarts. What's a congress tart? Just, I love them, it's me, I can't get them in London, right? So I'd have some of them and. If anyone can get a congress tart for Carl in London, please let him know. So anyway, this day, that was just a normal day, do you know what I mean? Once, twice a week, you'd have a. Load of cake in your life. Yeah, with the frog boys there with webbed hands and the big heads and the horse in the city. But the day after, one of these days, I had really bad cramp in my belly. I was like in agony, could hardly walk. So I said to my mom, hardly. Staggered to the free cakes, so I. Was in absolute agony. I said, I think I don't like doctors but you'll have to get a doctor in cuz I don't know what it is, I can't walk. She gets the doctor around, I won't say his name but he said, said, well, doesn't look like he's got long left. Blimey. So I was a bit like, hang on a minute, I've only had a few cream donuts. Yeah, My mum was panicking, sure. He went, my dad came in from work, she said oh, something's really bad. We Carl, I think it's serious, you know, the doctor said he ain't got long left. So he said what? He said that and just left. So she said, yeah, so I'll have to call him then. So he called him up, said, what's all this about? You know, Carl hasn't got long left. How long's he got? So yes, I was only messing, just got, just had some bad cream. Can you Believe that. Well, the thing is, I like the. Fact your mum didn't ask any questions. Can you explain more, Doctor? No, I got a shoe off, but she doesn't. You know, I don't want to diss you or your family, but I imagine if I was there, I'd have known the doctor was joking. That's all I'm saying. I mean, I sound very arrogant there, but I imagine he went, what's he done? I had about six cream grass. All right. Oh, wow. He hasn't got long to live then. I'll see you later. That's what I think the doctor did. Yeah. It's like the idea your mum just let him go. Yeah. Terrified, thinking, well, I'm not gonna probe. That's it. Then dad comes in, Hi, honey, I'm home. Anything happened? That doctor said Carl's gonna die and then left. Did he? I'll call him. But anyway, that's why these sort of things fascinate me. So we'll move on to this next one, right. Which is brilliant. Short story. So, right, old woman, about 70 years old. She's normally fit and healthy and stuff. Nothing wrong with her. She's having a good life. And one day she goes for a check to the doctors just to check herself out. She's getting on a bit, yeah. Says, take your clothes off and that. So she does and checks her out, says, yeah, you're looking good, you're looking good. Turn round. He said, oh, God. Says, you got a tumor on your buttock. Right? So she goes, oh, can you do anything to sort out? So they go, yeah, yeah, yeah. We book you in for an operation. It's best if we remove this. Books are in for an operation. Operation day comes, strip her down and that they're all stood round. The doctors start to operate. It only turns out it's a pork chop that she sat on five years earlier and it had stuck to her buttock. Right, Carl, I can forward you. Right. No, listen, serious. Okay, Carl, I'll tell you now, I'm leaving. I'm never. I'm never doing this show again. No, I'm serious. Honestly, I've never had any such. You are. Play a record. Play a record. I couldn't believe it. What do you mean you can't believe? Stop the record. Stop the record. Stop the record. Right, okay, right. What do you mean you couldn't believe it? No, when I read it, I said, I've got to tell Ricky this woman. Had a pork chop stuck to her ass for five years. You mental case. Of course, she didn't. Doves caught by the river. People are gonna think you're thick, Carl. Well, they can think what they want because if they do their own research, they'll probably find the story because it won't have happened that many. Carl, think about it. I mean, how could an old woman have a pork chop stuck to her ass for five years? No, she said she. She couldn't remember even making one, so she was as surprised as the doctors were. But hold on, though. She presumably must have sat on it naked. Didn't that. Didn't that bring back any memories? That's weird. But Carl, Carl. But why would it stay there? Why wouldn't it fall off when she had a bath or a shower? What about a bath? But why didn't the doctor realize that when he first looked at it? Was he not paying attention when he said, I think he's a tuna? Think about it. A pork chop stuck to your ass for five years. You're naked, you sit on a pork chop, you go, nothing. You know, there's nothing weird about that. I can't feel anything. Even if you had a dead leg, the time you stuck pork, chopped it. What up? She got dressed. Well, she might have not done that that much. She's old. She probably sat down and didn't move for a bit. And over time, it's stuck. And then. What do you mean over time it's stuck? Do you think the longer something there, the more it stays there? Look, I know it's. That's. The pork chop goes. Well, we've been here a year. We're not gonna move now. I don't think we're gonna move now. I'm quite, you know, attached to this buttock. I think I stay here for another four years until some doctor works it out. They got. They got her into hospital, they gave her the bed baths, they got her ready for the operation. They laid her out. They decided to take the. Get the scissors or the knife, make the incision. Hang on a minute. This is a pork. This is a. Bring me a frying pan. This is a pork chop. Right. Well, okay. Well, if you're happy with it, then. I'm happy with it. Fine. That happened then. So did the shaved monkey who got off with a wife. Fine. Rockbusters then. We've. We've got a problem with the email this week. They're not coming through. So I'll give out the clues again and then you can call in on 0870. Only call if you know all three. You can rattle them off yeah, we'll do it during the next. So the number is 0870-81234. Oh, wait. Oh, 8 700, 81234. Right, okay, so you got that? So call in if you know all three. Yeah, the three. Just to recap, I've got three other jumpers like this one, the initials ft. That bunch of people can't make up their minds if they want to sit in the sun or not. Right, that's C. And the Jamaican fellow had some aspirin. Why did he do that? Right, that's fd. So if you know them, give us a call. And it's just the first with the. With the three calling now, Carl. So play a lovely record and take some phone calls and let's get this. Do you want to play this old Lulu track? Oh, yeah. Don't laugh when you hear Lulu, because this is a Man who Sold the World by David Bowie. It's a good version, syntax for IXFM 104.9. Ricky Today, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilington. Right, get off. Right, what you got next? Right, well, running a bit late with this, but it's time for. Do we need them? We're. We're looking into what. I'm really worried about this because everyone's getting that last clue wrong. I reckon it's so rubbish that even your mental fans can't work out. Yeah, it's a tough one, but give. That final Rock Busters clue again. The Jamaican fellow had to have some aspirin. Why is that? Why did he have to do it? Hold on, that's changed. Well, I mean, it doesn't matter. The story. Oh, it doesn't matter. That's the point of a cryptic clue, innit? Oh, do, Do. What have you got now? Right, so we. We're looking into animals that we get rid of. I've spoken to someone about snails. I spoke to someone about jellyfish and that. And looking at cockroaches today. Right, now, who's the expert? This woman called Jessica Marshall. Right. Does she know that you're going to play this on the radio? Well, I called up, right, in the week and said, can I talk to someone about cockroaches? And she was like, is that Carl? She knows who you are. Yeah. Right, so she already knows maybe your angle, your approach. Yeah, and she's an expert, she's just not. Not just some random person. She works in a museum. Where? A good museum. I said I'd give it a plug. It's the one near Knightsbridge. It's got dinosaurs and it's worth seeing. Yeah. So he's not sure. He's not sure this is what happened. Now what I'll do, I'll tell you as much as I know and then you can fill me in if I'm right or wrong. And then at the end of it we'll get to the bottom of whether we need them or not. Okay? All right, so first of all, the first thing that I found out is that they have 18 knees. That's not exactly possible. They're insects. So they have six legs and a knee is usually the junction between femur and tibia. That's sort of classic human knees and every other animal knee. So with six legs you can only have six knees. Could somebody sort of got mistaken for seeing one that was a bit double jointed? I think you're grasping at straws or something. All right, well we might have to come back to that one then. They can hold the breath for 40 minutes. Well, they don't do that because they don't breathe in the same way as us. They breathe through little spiracles, holes down the side of the body. So no, they're not a very apt simile because the method of breathing is so different. What do you mean? Because insects have a totally different system. They don't have lungs in the way that we do, just breathing through one part of the body. They're actually breathing through every segment of the body all of the time. So even though they've got their mouth shut, they might be able to slide. Nothing to do with breathing. So you see, maybe that's where someone's gone wrong. Someone's got hold of one and sort of taped its mouth up or something and got bored after 40 minutes and. Said, well, we'll call it wrong kind. Thing to do to an insect, even to a cockroach. Yeah, but it's all. Can't do that. Yeah, but pretty unkind thing to do anything to anything, even a cockroach. Something else I found out they can live for a week without an edge. Well, that's true if they don't bleep to death in the process. But the weird thing is when I told you that they had 18 knees, you seemed a bit sort of like, don't talk ridiculous. But then we're talking about an animal that can live without an head. So there's a little bit of truth in that one. Yeah. Yes. Why when it was invented has it got that facility, say if someone said to humans, we could do that with humans. And you know, if you lose your Head in some accident. It gives you a bit of time to sort of go back to your family and maybe write them a note. You won't be able to have a chat, but write them a note saying, it was my own fault and it was nice knowing you. That would be a useful facility, I agree. But cockroaches are great survivors. I mean, they've been around for over 300 million years. They're one of the most primitive insects. Well, I've also. Is it true that they do a lot of resting? Apparently they can sort of rest for 75% of the time. Rest? Yeah, they just. Just sit about doing nothing. It's probably true of a vast proportion of the world's fauna. I mean, maybe, maybe the 25% that they are working, they're really giving it some. So it might make searching out food and. Yeah, they can slow down considerably. You can chill insects in the fridge and they'll become very, very quiet. You might think they're dead. Yeah, but I'm sure, you know, if we were sat in a fridge, you know, we'd go a bit quiet, wouldn't we, you know? Well, you might not know much about it, of course. Yeah. But not quite reading the right sources. Well, I've been using the Internet. I'm sure there are many useful sources that you could find there, but some of those seem to have been a little misleading to you. So you don't agree with a lot of what I've told you there? No. So cockroaches, can we get rid of them? No. So we're keeping them, then? I would say so, yeah. I think we should get her on more often because she sounds like she'd be a bit of an ally. Really? Because she knew immediately you were talking nonsense. She even said, I think you should be more concerned about your sources, which I've been trying to tell you for a year. Right. The fact. I mean, 18 knees, where did you get that from? It was on the Internet. They can hold their breath for 40 minutes. I mean, I don't know what. I don't know what. You read and take on Mad World, don't it? Right. The cure, obviously, right. Carl's been taking phone calls for these clues, right? And so everyone's been saying the same thing. For the last one, he's been going, no, no, and I'm worried. I'm always worried. Fd. I just overheard him on a call, they're going, what have I been saying? Oh, no, it's fp, dickhead. Right, give me the clues out. It's a rollover. I tell people we're really sorry to anyone who would have got that. Right. Okay. Right. Do the clues quickly. Tell them it'll be a rollover. So we have to do three new ones. Do not write these down. I don't write the answers down in case Ricky looks over the thing and sees the answer. Why would I cheat? I'd rather you do something Right. With your life. Right. Well, the clues were. I've got three other jumpers like this one. Yeah, that was ft. Yeah, they got that four tops. Yeah, that's all right. Good. Well done. That bunch of people can't make up their minds if they'd want to sit in the sun or not. That was C. They were getting that. That was charlatans. Charlatan. Right. A bunch of them. Charlatans. Right. What's Charlie? No, no, it's like Charlotte, go out. Shall we? Charlotte. Charlotteans. They got it right. Where I went wrong with this one. The Jamaican fella, he had to have some aspirin. Why it my fault? You know, I'm not. There's no point passing the book or anything. I said fd. A lot of people were saying Fred Durst, like, forehead hurts. Which is a good thing. Yeah. Which would have been as good as. Any of yours, but I made an error. So we'll roll it over. No. What is the answer? What? Jamaican fellow. What? Add some aspirin. Why do that? What's the. What's the thing? Fp. Fp. It was Frieda. Pain Free. The pain free. The pain free. The pain free. The pain. That's awful. You've got to write these down next. You're the producer. I know, I know, but I've had a busy week, haven't I? Just an excuse. That isn't an excuse. Our excuses. We don't. We have. We don't care. Yeah, you do. Yeah. I mean, it's better not to try than try your hardest and be rubbish. Do you see what the point we've got. We don't care. But you've got standards. Yeah. And you're not meeting your fault. Think of that. You're not even reaching your standards. God. Right. Well, that's that, I guess. Well, the prizes will be giving those away next week. Again, just complete the song for the. Ladies to end the show with. It's from Nick Cave's new album, Noctorama. This is a track called he wants you back next week. Remember, Free to Pain.",
