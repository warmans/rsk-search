  "text": "Oh yeah, the smooth indie sound of Richard Ashcroft. Science of silence on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. Joined me is Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. It was an excellent link that. Rick, did you say NIME at 1.10? 4.9. Other than that it was textbook. I, I, yeah, a desperate attempt of being articulate, sure. But let myself down. Here's the good thing about the boxing thing because there's no chance of me, you know. No, no, I already slurred my words. So no one any damage will be totally fine. Yeah, the doctor's rushing in. I think there might be some kind of concussion. Jane, just going, no, that's just the way he talks. But because I'm thinking maybe did you start the show with, with that particular kind of manner? Just because obviously a lot of new listeners, I imagine, thanks to the massive poster campaign and you obviously want. There's a few examples today of irony coming back and biting you. Yeah, that seemed like a funny idea at the time, me posing. Jonathan Ross phoned me up when they first went up and he said, I've just seen a big poster of a predatory gay. Yeah, you do look a little bit. Yeah. Hello, what's your name? Like to sit down here and then you're in the background. And also I think the funny thing about having you as a partner, I mean, the only good thing is that, you know, you look, you look weird and tall. Like too freakishly tall and lanky. But in that one, no, because your background and you're smiling. You don't look as weird as you do in real life or as, as freakishly tall. So it sort of ruins it a little bit for me. Look at, look at, look. Pilkington. What are you not listening? He's just opening a packet. What are they, McVitters? See, see, we should mention them. We get some free ones if anyone at McVitt is, are listening because we're not getting the perks of this. Nothing. I'd say I'm not getting anything. I really got in this game for the ladies, for the money, for the voiceover work. Certainly I'm seeing, hiding the hair of that. But you're not getting the voiceover because Jethro, the Jethro's getting all this parts that you might get. Yeah, sure, sure. Yeah, okay. Rick. Yeah. You were the voice of what? The drink driving campaign. You sound like, you sound like a man who was run over in a drink drive incident. It's like you don't get any money for that. Oh, did I? I can't remember. It's like. I mean, I don't drive. Yeah, well, that's good. No, it's a don't drink and drive. So I've chosen just to drink. At least I can formulate sentences using the English language. And I'm not getting the voiceover work. What's it, the English language of the 14th century? Well, it's better. Better a English language. An English language rather than whatever kind of Middle England language you speak. The language of the hobbits. All right, Carl, all right. So you're eating a biscuit. I can't believe it. Are you bored with this already? Do you know what MTV called me last week? They called me again yesterday and said, when can they come down to do it? Oh, they're coming down next Saturday, by the way, to do a little screen test for you. They're gonna sort of just film you with a little camcorder. You said this. They're gonna film you. Are you alright? Do you want it? I mean, are you hungry? Do you want to go out and have a meal? I can't believe you're eating while I'm on air. No one can hear that. Do you know who I am? No one can hear. Explain who I am. Well, that's Ricky Gervais, right? He's made his name on tv. Yeah. Okay. He's done any number of corporate gigs, which. And they pay silly money. I mean, this guy's earning, you know, and really earning beyond his talent. All right? So I think I deserve a little bit more than a little mank eating a biscuit while I'm talking. Rich of a's. Yeah. Have you won a bafta? Yeah, too. All right, so just a little bit of respect. Yeah, yeah. Carl, what have you won? What have you won? Got a bronze certificate for doing a full week at school. It was only a bronze. What's that then? Three out of five days. And I got me a little Crusaders badge, if you. If you remember the Crusaders badge for the religious club. So I was at the fellow that you went and played. You actually got to talk to you about God. Yeah, yeah. You got a Crusaders badge, did you? Yeah, that's why I went. That's why I joined. That's why I joined for the. I like the little badge. Did four weeks and then packed it in. But we're talking about mtv, right? And I was feeling a bit nervous, wanna. About like, you know, the way I look, right. And what have you. And then I watched a bit of Celebrity Big Brother. And all the fuss that Mark Owens getting and he's not, he's not that good looking, is he? He's, he's very. I like, I want to be Mark Owens mate. If anyone who knows Mark Owen or Mark Owen's listening, I want to be his mate. I think he's brilliant. I think he's a nice lad but what I'm saying is, right, all the girls go mad over him. Yeah. And he's not, he's not that good looking, is he? Well no, he's got. Isn't a certain way, isn't he? That sort of non threatening? Yeah, but he's not, he's not stunning, is he? Do you know what I mean? No, but what's your definition of a stunner? Who do you like? Someone who you look at and you go, God, they're, they're good. What bloke do you think's attractive then? So if I was into men. Yeah, yeah. In fact you can, you can still say a bloke's a good looker without like fancying him. Who do you think is attractive probably? Oh, I mean it depends what you're looking for. Would you say it was like stunning in your definition? A good looking lad? Yeah, good looking lad. Oh, look at him over those. Oh. Do you find, you know, Robbie Williams? Do you find him attractive? Boy next door, look. No, no. Who do you. Carl, hurry up because it's, you know, we've only got two hours probably. Do you know, I, I can't think of one off. And Mark Owen is pretty good looking then. Really? Well there's not just name one bloke that you think's an attractive guy. There must be one bloke that you've either met or that you've, you know, seen in a pub on a toaster. Tell you what, go on, tell you what works here, young Alex Zane. Oh, I love you Alex. Brilliant. I love that, that's, that's like a ride song or something. That's my favorite Rydish. Rydish feeder. Just the way I'm feeding on XFM 104.9. Rick, quick question for you. I'm thinking a lot of people may maybe are tuning in for the first time because of the advertising campaign. Should we reintroduce Carl again? I know we've done this a few times in the past, but just worried that people are gonna not, you know, not really kind of get the measure of him. Yeah, I'm Ricky Gervais, the one off the Office. Yeah, Steve Merchant, he's not the one in the office. He's not. He's not Gareth. Some people think he is. He's got a funny, weird west country accent that actually mackenzie was affecting for the role. Steve wrote it with me. He's lanky fella. Carl is our sort of, I say, producer, but he's the one that pressed the buttons because. Yeah, but I mean, it was just because I was too big to run the desk. Yeah. I used to have. Literally too big. Yeah. And then we discovered that, you know, he looked a bit like a boring sort of. All right. Yeah. But then when we sort of, you know, poked him with a stick, he came up with. He doesn't realize. But some of the. That I think. Say hello, Carl. All right. Yeah. What classics, I think, so far that have gone straight to the list include, have you ever used a Y front correctly? Yeah. Brilliant. You never see an old person eating a Twix in a Twix. These are sort of things. He's back on his campaign to get rid of jellyfish. Why is that? Oh, did you see the paper yesterday? Go on. There's a jellyfish, it's about 15 foot long, about 5 foot wide, and there's a fella swimming next to it. And the paper's going, oh, look at this. We've found there's loads of them in Japan. Yeah. And it's because they. All the. The water's getting hot, so it's making jellyfish really big. How's the campaign going to get jellyfish red? You know, get rid of them. What was your point about jellyfish? They don't do anything. There's no point. They're getting away. It ruined me holiday because I got stung by one. Yeah, but you think the same thing about Liverpudlians. And we can't just go around, you know, wiping out things that really. Jellyfish first, and then. Then we'll move on to the Scousers. Yeah. But. Yeah, I don't know what they do. And I'm still. I mean, I'm trying to look on the Internet. I've been busy this week. You're jellyfish now, not Scousers. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know what they do either. Try and work out what would happen with the sea if it didn't work. Because they say, like, if there's no. Scott, that's what we're talking about. Let's do it. People listen the first time. They've got to listen to every word you say. You want to find out what would happen with the sea if it didn't work if. If jellyfish weren't in there. Do you know what I mean? Because stuff like coral, apparently the sea would be in a right state if you didn't have any coral. Yeah. In it. Fish. Yeah. I mean, I always worry about how many fish we're sort of eating because you go past. Sorry, no. Do you know, like, you go in Marks and Spencers or Selfish. There's loads of fish in there and there's. There's really fancy stuff that you think they've killed that. And it looks good on the counter. Pretty impressive. Yeah. But is anyone gonna buy it? Do you know what I mean? It's a big. Like a shark sat in ice. Yeah. And you go, yeah, they've got. They've got like a lot of fish. Going around the tight gallery. No. Do you know what I mean? I've never seen a big shark sat in ice in Selfridges. They do. They do it and it's like you go in the morning and you can go back at night and the same shark sat there and it's. It's, you know, it's the same shark. It's the same one. What? Same face. Are you sure? He just hasn't lost his mum and he's just like. He went shopping with her, Christmas shopping. And he's just like. He's around, he doesn't know where. He's just waiting, you know? I'm right. I've never seen a shark in Selfridges. Well, all right, then say maybe that's one day a week, but on other days, Shark Monday. Yeah. Sandwiches. Today at sandwiches is Shark Monday. Yeah. No, it's just like. Your point is that there's all these fish not being eaten. Yeah. So they're being killed. They're taking them out of the sea. No one's eating them. And you're worried what, that the sea's gonna rise because the more things you take out, well, we're just gonna run out because. Because the fish drink it, don't they? And that. Keep level down. Yeah. No, well, you know. You know what I mean? There's stuff this stuff that worries me. You're worried that. Was it you who said that you were worried that? Because, you know, there's sponge in the sea. Yeah, but if they took it all away. No. Was it. That's a Stephen Wright. Is that Steven? Right? What's the joke? Sponges grow in the sea. That kills me. How deep would it be if they did? I love the fact that he confused you with Stephen Wright. Who. Who For a living. Purposely says ridiculous things. Yeah. Does that worry you, Carl? Well, think about that and play a record. What do you want? I'd love to. A classic. A beautiful song by Simon Agarth. Uncle. April comes, she will April comes, she will. Simon A Garth, Uncle. That was in the days when they kept songs short. Short and sweet. What do you think of that, Carl? Yeah, it's good. Yeah, it's a good one. Yeah. Yeah, excellent. So, yeah, so that. That's. That's Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Coming up on the show, we've got Educating Ricky. I'm not happy with this. Oh, really? Because the last few weeks have been genius. What is. What is the drop in quality is there of the education of me? It's just like I said, I've wasted a lot of time this week searching on the web. Right. You waste a lot of time searching the web because you come up with things that aren't true. Why don't you look in books and verified. Sort of like journals? The new book, though, innit? No, the web is the new book. Yeah. So I've been searching is hardly anything. I spoke to you in the week about Monday or Tuesday. What did you say? There's nothing happened this week in the world. There's nothing going on. There was a new car wash that you can put dogs in. There was a car Washington. That's the only thing that's happened in the world. And that and the jellyfish and we've covered that. So. So we've got. Yeah, I've managed to find some bits, but it's not that good. Rock busters. Yeah, we've really gee'd up. So that's coming up. The thing that's not that good. Yeah, yeah, look forward to that. Yeah. Can you just quickly tell us about the car wash with the dog in it? I don't know. What's that? Didn't make the top three. I didn't waste that much time on it, to be honest. It just said, you know, how busy are you? Have you got a dog? How about saving some time? There's some car wash out. It's not car wash, it's dog wash. You take it down there, put your coin in, put your dog in and it comes out clean. See, there's nothing in it. Is this called a bath, isn't it? No, but it's like a machine. Right, There's a machine, but. But we'll look, you know, that's why I didn't pick it. So we've got. We've got Some beds coming up. Rockbusters. Yeah. Rick, can I just, can I just explain some of the prizes we got here for Rockbusters because I just want you to try and picture, if you would, the kind of XFM listener who'd particularly want this collection. This collection of. You've got the, the best chill out album ever. This is the one, as I said before, that's largely made up of songs you may have heard in adverts. Sure. So you've got the, the Volvo advert on there. T Mobile. Brilliant. That's on there. So that's Roy. So look forward to that. Yeah. Again, just, just imagine which XFM listener is particularly looking forward to. Top of the Morning with Terry Wogan, his two disc set there you got, he starts with the Bangles on there. We've got Billy Joel, river of Dreams, shine on by Mr. Christopher. So just look forward to that. We got the only Fools and Horses, last year's Christmas special. We, we gave one of those away last year, last week. But still more to shift. Do I spy a little free. Yes, it's a little free. Three wheel trotter. Independent trading, three wheel car. So that's there as well. So as I say, if you, if you like fairly mediocre comedy, little Jonathan. Ross's face there on the back. And maybe you also want Jerry Halliwell's Body Yoga dvd. Rick. So. Sure. Yeah. Well, that's good quality and then just. A few token XFM kind of things. We've got the manic Street Preachers DVD and the U2 best. Tell me, Steve, how do the lucky. When listeners win these. Rick, I'm glad you've asked. What they do is they email in with the answers to Rockbusters, which is a quiz. Hold on now. How do they email if we don't know the email address? Again, thanks for asking. Thanks for flagging that up. Ricky Gervais fm.co.uk that'll be coming up shortly. Try and get into the mindset of Carl Pilkington. A lot of people have been trying to email in answers. Trying to think through kind of logically. Sure. Or maybe based on the rules that they've picked up over the years or. When he says it, a cryptic clue. They believed him. Exactly. Yeah. So you've just got to think more like a mentalist. Try and get. First of all, right, the prizes that I source every week. Explain yourself what I said to you we're doing between now and Christmas, because this is just a few weeks till Christmas. Right. I thought I'd make Up sort of family packs. Okay. That the winner can have something say like There's a nice U2 album in there. Right. So the winner might want to keep that, but they can get rid of the Jerry Yoga thing. Let's see if only Fool's Nurses to uncle. To the dad. The dad. Yeah. I think the mum would love the Terry Wogan. Yeah. The yoga for the sister. Right. Yeah. And all that. So is that. Is that. That's. That's what you. You thought through, was it? Or was it that there was a load of junk in the office or. Did you scoop them up with two arms and it's as much you could carry down the corridor? Yeah, a little bit of that. But yeah, that's me. That's me workings on why you've got all that. Brilliant. That's excellent. That's coming up. My mum sent some more what we also needed. He's got a little. He's got a letter from his mum. My mum did some more Rockbusters for us. I reckon they're secretly listening, Carl. They've said they're not listen in, but I reckon they are. Does that worry you? Well, let's play a record and let's hear this. Who your mom's Rockbusters. Better, Warren. Well done, Regulators. I hope Nate's involved. I hope so. Property. We're damn good too. Nana. You know, you're right on XFM 104.9. I had to meet the doctor for the. For this fight thing in the week and it's the one who's off Big Brother psychiatrist. Yeah. And. But she's a medical doctor and she's sort of big in the. In the boxing sort of world as well. And one of the tests I had to. A punch test. The other test I had to do was to get in the bod podcast. Yeah. Yeah. And he wiped it down since he. Yeah, and I was a little bit nervous and so what does this do? What exactly does it do? What it does it. You do a. A displacement sort of calibration with a known volume. All right. Just bear in mind that Carl's listening. So if you want to explain that. What it does, Carl, is it works out your density, okay. Through displacement. It knows how much of what your volume is for the air displaced right in this. In this thing. And in layman's terms, what does it tell you? It tells you. Well, it knows. It knows what muscle weighs, it knows what fat weighs. It knows your average density of your. Your skeleton, what height you have there. So it works out from Your volume and your density, it can work out, therefore probably what percentage of that is muscle, fat, bone, etc. What. What if you put in one of those. Oh, God. Oh, go on, then. No, go on. What were you going to ask? What would it do if you put in one of those pug dogs? One of those what? What do you mean, what would it do? Like on Ricky's lap? No. Do you know those dogs that are all wrinkling have got too much skin for the skeleton and it's all like caving in and folding over? Would the machine go, well, we know what you are, so it's all right. Or would it say, oh, what's going on here? Yeah, I mean, like last week when you were. Why do you want. Why do you want to confuse machines? Do you remember when he put in Y to a computer searcher to try and confuse it? I love the fact I want the computer to come back. Why not? And your head explode. I mean, I love the idea that you're trying to. What? I mean, it's better than what I. Thought you were gonna say, which is, what if you put a fly in there? But anyway. So anyway, what percentage of you is muscle and what percentage of you is fat? I'm. I'm 25 fat. 25 fat, yeah. Now, what's written most likely most to me is muscle bone density in that Rick Waller was 60 fat, which I've looked into it and apparently is exactly the same as a pork scratching. Wow, that's extraordinary. So he is. He is, yeah. The equivalent of a 30 living stone. Yeah. So. So it's 20 fat. Is that good or bad? No, 20's all right. 25 is over. Right. Men. Healthy fit, lean men. About 18, 20. So you're a healthy fit? No, no, 18, 12. I'm 25. Oh, you're 25? Yeah. Right, yeah. So I'm. I'm 5%. Yeah, over. And a boxer. A boxer that is in peak, you know, with the app, basically. You've seen the ones, they just look, you know, like Bruce Lee. They're 8%, 8% fat. So is that good for you? Well, I don't think it's that bad for you. I mean, you know, you need a. Bit Bruce light that Bruce Lee, supposedly. I mean, there's many rumors, I'm sure you're fascinated by them, Carl. Conspiracy theories surrounding Bruce Lee's death, one of which is that his body was. It's at the peak of physical perfection. He had an aspirin because of a headache and it reacted with his. Because Just the impurities in the aspirin killed him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because it's sort of like quite interesting and a bit weird. Yeah, that's fact. I love the air. Well, are you aware of the fact that supposedly he actually cheated death? He actually faked his own death so he could work undercover for the Hong Kong police? Are you aware of it? Yeah, yeah. Do you believe that as well? Not so. Not so convinced. Do you believe he could kill a man by putting all his energy into a trembling hand and touching him when every blood vessel burst? Well, it's just another form of trickery in it. I mean you met up with with Darren, didn't you? Old met with Darren Brown. Yeah, Darren Brown, yeah. He's incredible. Yeah. He's probably the Britain's best illusionist, if you don't mind me saying. Yeah, you can put that on the. Poster if he wants. Tell you what though, right, changing the subject a bit. We're talking about a fly getting in that pod. Yeah, yeah. Read in the Week when I was searching for stuff to educate. You know the Educate Ricky section. Yeah. Which we will be. Do you want to answer that phone? Because it's annoying me. Who's phone in? I don't know. It's obviously someone who doesn't know that you're talking at the moment. So leave. Could be it could be. Leave it. It could be the head of. Leave it. Yeah, go on. Could be the head of xfm. Yeah. Oh, I'm so scared. No, no, no, I won't be embarrassing him. I going. Don't call me when I'm working. Nice machine. High five. Yeah. Raging against the machine. Yeah. Right. We're talking about flies getting in a pod and you know like how a Barbie doll, if it was real, it wouldn't be able to work. A Barbie doll if a woman had the proportions. Yeah. She wouldn't be a tie shoelaces up and stuff because. Because her legs are too long for her back and all that. Flies. Scientists can't work out how they fly. It's a bee. It's a bee. It's a be little fly. No, fly as well. No, A fly is apparently its body is like too big for its wings and they still can't work it out. Yeah. Which in your mind says what? Something spooky. They have worked out that they. It's fact that what they do the. The wing actually beats ridiculous about 150 times a second. So it displaces air. Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean, I know what you mean. It's it's incredible that it can fly because it's got such small wings. Yeah. All right. And it's a bee, not a fly. Yeah. But other than that. Good point, Bowie. Another classic. Be My Wife of the Low album. David Bowie. Carl, you don't feel depressed, mate. You don't feel low. You're currently right about everything. David Bowie. It's a cracker. Be My Wife off Low. Very good indeed. Yeah. You know my frustration with the homeless. Yeah. You know, they wind me up walking through Soho last night. I saw a homeless fella reading a book. Yeah. Well, I'll tell you this. If he's got the wherewithal to read a book. Yeah. Right. He's obviously, you know, he wants to keep himself occupied, his mind occupied, his mind educated. Yeah. My point is, why not, instead of reading the book, have a quick look through the job vacancy section of the Evening Standard? Or maybe just take the time to fill in some kind of application form for, you know, maybe, you know, confusing. There was the. Is the. Is the ability to read with the ability to house yourself? Well, no, because what I'm saying is it seems to me he's obviously got a certain, you know, grasp psychologically of, you know, his way. People who haven't got houses, a lot. Of them are Rick. I've seen them dancing and shouting and screaming, you know, and pissing in doorways and stuff. Yeah, yeah. You're confusing the homelessness with trampiness. Well, again, you know, some people just have left home and they haven't got. A. Gervais, I'm not a sociologist. Sorry if I can't spot all the clever distinctions that a trained expert such as yourself can. All I know is there was a fellow reading a book. Well, you know, you know, the ones that have got beards and sing little tunes and. They're my favorite. Yeah. They're drinking special brew. Yeah. That's an alcoholic tramp. Right. You know, the ones that sit with a dog or cell, Big Issue, they just. They just haven't got their own place. Right. Do you see? Okay. Well, again, I mean, there's. Because I. It's tricky finding the place. I know, because I had to move house recently and it's a nightmare. I had to get, like, estate agents on it, and I had to go and see a load of places, and I was doing a job as well, you know, I still managed to fit it in. This guy's just lounging around on the street. Yeah. So I'm surprised. He should be able to find loads of places. I'M surprised he can't find the time to visit a couple of different residences. Yeah. Because there's some pretty cheap ones, you know, if you go kind of a bit farther out of London, maybe it's because he wants to live in the Soho area. And frankly, what I'm confused about is the number of homeless people that recognize me and say they enjoy the office. They've got to be. Watched it through Dixon's window. I think that's probably a demographic that's sort of hungover from some of your previous TV work. The 11 o'clock show. Yeah, you know, or stuff like that. The ones that used to snitch out. Yeah, exactly. Tramps and the French for me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or maybe sort of people who watched, you know, have watched the show and then have fallen on hard times since then. I don't know. And this is not necessarily linked. No, I wouldn't have thought so. Carl's lost. Carl's lost in this conversation. Carl, we boring you, then? No, no, it's just. I don't know, it's a bit tight, isn't it? What? Cause it's like, I sometimes think it could have been me when I see homeless people and that. I just think, you know, I nearly killed a man once. It could have totally changed me life. Yeah. You want to slow down there? Just back up for a second. Just back up for a second. About that time when I was in Wales, right, I picked up a big piece of slate and chucked it off the cliff. Oh, yeah, right. And it nearly hit a fella. Yeah. Right. In that split second, if he would have decided to sort of go and pick up a shell that was closer to the sea, it could have hit him. Yeah. It would have killed him. And I. I won't be sat here today. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. So it's just all about luck in it, right? Yeah. Do you know what I mean? So. Dunno. That's about it, really. That's. That's. That's the point. That's the political point that you. Therefore. Yeah. No, he's saying. He's saying, you know, you should count our blessings because, you know, anything can happen. Yeah. You never know what's around the corner. Sure. It's like, if Carl had met us, he'd still be in that little room making jingles. Now he is a respected household name. Do you think he packed the book before he left home to become homeless? He thought, well, I got the clothes, I'm gonna need the cigarettes, we need the dog. And the piece of string. And I probably need some. Probably gonna need some reading literature as well because I'm gonna get pretty bored, like just sitting in the street begging all day. Maybe it's something I should take. I want to catch up on some of the stuff I haven't read, you know. Or maybe it's those themed holidays. You know, they're trendy, middle class people, right. They go on like the adventure holidays and danger. Maybe the latest one amongst sort of like yuppie types is homeless holidays. Yeah, they pay like £10,000 exactly. And they really get a little area. Of sort of the street society and. People come up to them and abuse them. Yeah, they're all trade, they're all actors. Yeah. They get beaten up at night when they're sleeping under a bridge. They, you know, they get to try a really safe sort of form of heroin. Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Brilliant. Now that's, that's worth marketing holidays, holidays like that home, you could have homeless, you could have like rent boy holidays. Find out what it's like to be a rent boy for three years. Yeah. And then, yeah, make a little bit. Of money on the side. They have to wean them off it at the end. They go, no, don't keep, don't keep stuck in it. You can stop finish now. You're. But yeah, you're. You're a bank manager again. I just, I've just got the taste for it, to be honest. Can that happen? No. It's worth knowing if that. If that is a possibility. Carl's worried. Well, we haven't said anything. We haven't said anything wrong. Don't be. No complaints. We haven't said anything. The words suck as far as I can work out. No, it's not a banned word on. The radio, is it? Rockbusters time. Okay. Yeah, Rockbusters. Well, let's. Let's play a tune and we'll come out with Rockbusters. Are we gonna hear your mums before? Best holiday I've ever had. I'll get a taste for it. That's a new American band called My Morning Jacket from the Sweatbees ep, that's called Lowdown. Like that? Yeah. Nice. It's good, yeah. I brought in some adverts, my favorite adverts to play. Really? Yeah, that's all. They're all new ones as well. We got those now. Can we hear them? Do you want to do them now or keep them listening to them later? No, do them now. Yeah. Oh, I do. They are good. Ready xfm. XFM Indeed, Steve. Absolutely. Sorry, what are you looking at? Well, I'm just looking at some of the emails and if I can find it, I got an absolute treat from you. Go on. Dickie Anderson. He's emailed Richard Anderson, our biggest fan. Biggest fan, he said. Dear Ricky, sorry for not tuning in recently, only I've been busy watching a puddle evaporate. Glad to hear you haven't tinkered with the show's winning formula by trying to introduce any quality into it. That's from Richard Anderson. So good to have Dicky Anderson listening again because he just keeps us on our toes, you know. Yeah. And good work, Rich. Thanks for that. I wonder what he looks like. Dickie Anderson. I think he's a good looking guy for some reason. I've always imagined him as being slightly older with maybe a beard. Oh, no, I think of him sort of chords and now in sweater. Definitely. I think he looks like maybe the Proclaimers. Yeah. But again with a beard or at least a mustache. Yeah. I don't know why I'm seeing some. Kind of facial and he's sort of like. He's sort of. He likes the Cure and the Swiss Nap, but. And he snarls at everything. He thinks everything's pure out. Yeah. I bet he prefers Radio five, do you think? Radio five? Yeah. Five. Yeah, yeah. And four. I bet he's a real music snob as well. I bet it's like there's certain bands, it's like rubbish. The Blazing Squad, rubbish. All pop music. Rush, Britney Spears, rubbish. Is this defamation of character? He slagged you off enough times. Rick and the Show. I don't know. And I'm only saying it's my opinion. I imagine so, yeah. I mean, we don't know. I mean, you know, he could be a lovely guy. I'm getting, to be honest, I'm getting to like him. What I like about Richard is he's willing to say what he thinks. Well, it's not. It's more than that. He's a bit like Eminem. No, it's. No, it's more than that. He actually hits on the truth too often for my liking. I mean, this is a shoddy show with very, very little to offer. You got to remember though, it is a bronze winning show. He did win a bronze award at the Sonys last year. One of the most coveted of the awards. Yeah. In my opinion, the bronze is slightly better than the gold. Well, a lot of people don't win the bronze. You got to remember that there's not many people this is. There's, you know, gold's got no intrinsic value, it's just a currency. And in my opinion, bronze is better. Yeah, in a way, Carl. Rockbusters. Yeah. No, we. Yeah, we did get a bronze, but this year we introduced Rockbusters. Things will be changing, so. Hey, we didn't introduce Rockbusters. Carl, please don't tar us with that brush. Yeah, you introduced. And also, do you remember that. Do you remember the show that got that bronze was the show with the complaint that was upheld by the Radio Authority? Was it really? Yeah. The show that got the. Got the award and was nominated was the one with the only upheld complaint we've ever had. Do you think if we hadn't discussed that particular subject for quite as long, we could have got the silver? I think it was the mention of. And I say this meaning male birds of all the cocks. Yeah. But do you think the Sony committee was going, I enjoyed the show. If they hadn't mentioned cocks meaning birds. Yeah, Meaning birds. Yes. I'd have given it the silver. Yeah. So, Carl, getting nervous. Rockbusters, then. Chance to win. All that stuff Steve was talking about before. We give initials and a cryptic clue and it's a band and there's three of them. And you email in ricky.gervais fm.co.uk. do you want some of my mums? Well, I think before you give us your own, we should hear your mums. Just to sort of set the tone and for you to get their heads around the whole idea. Send some more. They're still not that up to scratch. First one. This group are nice on toast. Marvel Jam. Yeah. Which one? Jam. Okay. Marmalade would have been Marmot's. Just as good. Yeah. This man liked his wine. This man liked his wine. Dean Martin. What, so no cryptic clue, just a man who drinks. Yeah, but that isn't there. Like a myriad of rockstar like boobs. I don't think anyone would have ever got that. That's fantastic. This man liked his wine. Dean Martin. This man liked his golf. Oh, clubby. Clubby. Oh, clubby. Chip face. No. Bunker Smith. Bing Crosby. Yeah. He likes his golf. Yeah. That's. That's genius. This man wasted wine. Just a couple more. Hope you're not speeding when you meet these. The police. Oh, it's great. Any other ones? Sounds like these lads work for the hospital. The. The porters. Say that again. Sounds like these lads work for the hospital. Jerry and the Pacemakers. Right, so we'll. Carl. I have to say, if there was ever in the future any doubt that you were your mother's son, that would pay that, believe me. You are a chip on. Well, let's, let's. So we have a little record and then Educating Ricky and Rockbusters of the prizes. Jerry Halliwell's yoga video dvd. I think it's the latest one in that particular series. So if you've already worked yourself up to, you know, you're looking pretty good, but a little bit of flabber maybe around the arse or breast area, then Jerry can help you out there. Yeah, we got Only Fools and Horses. This is the Christmas special from last year. Jonathan Ross was giving that. Well, he's morning show this morning. I don't know if they're just trying. To get Top of the Morning to. You from Terry Wogan. That's his 2D CD. I'm sure they were giving that away. You've got the likes of Love Theme from Top Gun obviously. Take My Breath Away by Brilliant. That's on there. What else we got? We got the Pretenders. You mentioned them earlier. Alison Moyes on there. Lennox featuring Paul. I still call her Alf. Loaf is on there. I'm talking of the meat variety. Mitch. Tina Turner on Silent Wings. There's a, you know, an incredible selection there. Perfect for saying mum or a deaf aunt. That's the Manning Preacher's great. Anyway, how's your aunt? The one who farted for five minutes? Carl. Also got the YouTube. What's up with her? The best chill out album ever. She'll be all right. Yeah. Okay, guys. So that's the prizes up for gr. So we were having two conversations there. I think we're a little bit too relaxed in this show. Sure. I mean, people tuning in will just think, do those three people know they're going out live or is that a conversation like between the records? It's. Do you know what I mean? It probably sounds like, yeah, the record is playing. We think the record's playing. We're just chatting. Oh, dear. What we got? What we got, Carl? What we got, Carl? Come on, Eminem. Lose yourself back on form there. Absolutely, yeah. Good, good. On XFM 104.9, Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington, more importantly. Carl. Come on then. Right. I need some education. I know it's Rockbusters. I know, but I need education. I need. But we've promised some Rockbusters. Educating Ricky. I will be ditching before Christmas. Why? It will be going. Why? Because there's nothing out there. She's just struggling I was thinking on the way in today, I can either do. Doing something more with Steve. Because we've done, like, the Ricky angle. Either we can do Educating Steve. No, either. Like a bit of a call my bluff type thing. But. But it's like a con merchant, and I have to, like, trick you. Okay. And you're the merchant. And then. Oh, I was thinking something that you just do. Do some work and you have a moan for a bit. And that's a bit. That's like a wine merchant that you just, like, whine on about something. Again, the pun comes first with you, doesn't it? Before it takes like that first. Yeah, that's like I told you. I've come up with a couple of sitcoms for me. One is I've got an imaginary navy navy called Merchants Navy Navy in it and the Premises, I've got a navy. And another one is I Live. And that's as far as he's got as well. Yeah, that's all I come up with. If you've got any ideas there, that'd be much appreciated. Another one is I live in quite a salubrious part of North London, and that's called Merchant of Little Venice. And I live in Little Venice Again, I don't know what happens. I don't know what happens, but any ideas? Carl? You know what? When I play an Italian waiter and it's called Shut Up a Gervais. Yep. So that's the one we're working on there, actually, to follow up with the Office. Do you like that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll do something with that. Yeah. But at the moment, we've got Rock Busters. Okay, so these are mine. Number one. You've been dunking that for too long. That's LB Oh, God, that's too easy. That's too easy. I always tease them, don't I? Give them something to make them feel like they're gonna win something. And then I hit them hard with. A tricky one that doesn't make sense. Yeah, go on. So the first one. So that's the cryptic clue for a band or an artist. Their initials are LB and the cryptic clue. You've been dunking that for too long. Yeah, so that's the first one. Second one. You won't be able to play that game in this pub because the table ain't big enough. Could be an old artist, could be a new one, could be a band. What's the initials? F.D. all right, F. D. You won't be able to play that game in this pub. The table ain't big enough. And the final one. Well, I've had a rubbish day, so I'm happy it's over. All right, that's. That's the third cryptic clue, the initials being G K. Right? Yeah. Well, I've had a rubbish day, so I'm happy it's over. They're the three clues. All you got to do is email in Ricky Gervais. That's great. That's genius. Which one? The last one. All right, that is genius. That's the best one you've ever done. All right, Ricky Gervase. That's great. UK emailing them. Three answers. You win the stuff. We have still got Educating Ricky. Let's have one. I'll give you the titles. Give me the titles. Yeah, go on. Right, you've got three bits of info that's gone on in the world or possibly sort of older times. Never go further back in the 17th century, do we? Well, no, let's make it clearer. There's three bits of information that people have put on the net, whether or not they're true definition and that he. Still gets it a little bit wrong in translation and sort of adds bits to it. Yeah, go on. So we've got. I love it when he plays out those historical dialogues. It's like the 15th century where he goes. So anyway, a bloke says to himself, I'll tell you what I'll do. So the horse isn't happy. Yeah, go on. Right, so the three that you've. You've got a pick from, you've got get your kit on, we're off down the butchers. Yeah, let's get your kit on. Rough down the butchers. Yeah, we've got Wash up with you. Wash up with you. Wash up with you. Yeah, the last one I couldn't really think of a good title for. So it's just. Why don't they just get a diary or some paper or something? Oh, play a record. We gotta make this into a book. This has gotta be a book out for Christmas. Chapter heading. Oasis live forever on XFM 104.9. Right, we're in the swing of things. It's my. It's mine. Steve's favorite bit of the whole show. This is what we do this show for now, Educating Ricky. Yeah, go for it. Carl, you said that learning can't be fun. Yeah, yeah, okay, I'll go for the one. What's the one about the butcher going down the butcher shop? You've got get your kit on, we're off. Down the butchers. Yeah. You're going for that one. Yeah. Well, do you know the saying, don't let the cat out the bag? Yeah. Do you know. Do you know what it means? Yeah. Don't give away a secret. Right, well, do you know it came about. No, well, ages ago. Before 17th century. Yeah, before, like. Yeah, yeah, 17's good. Yeah. Before, like, you know, proper butchers and Jewish and supermarkets and that. You used to get these blokes who sold meat. Right, right. Butchers, they were called then, I think. Yeah, yeah. But the difference was they didn't stay in the same place. They moved about. Right. So they turn up on a street corner, right. And you'd have, like, loads of carrier bags of, like. Carrier bags. Yeah. With, you know, with meat in and that. And people would plastic carry bags. Yeah. With mobile butcher on them. Yeah, yeah. Right. So. Yeah, go on. People went, right, yeah, I need some meat. Right. So they'd. They go up to this bloke and say, what have you got? He'd say, well, I've got a. Got a. You know, you can have a bag full of pig or you can have whatever. Bag full of chicken, whatever. And they go, yeah, how much? They go, you know, call it. Call it fiverr, whatever. Yeah. And they buy them and to. To make more money, they didn't always fill the bag with what they said was in it. And. Yeah, I thought that might be the case. Right, so what did they do? Cats in there? Yeah. But I don't see what. What. Okay, so sometimes they would put a cat in the bag and pretend it was chicken or whatever else. Yeah. So why was a cat any cheaper than a chicken? Because cats are wandering around the streets, aren't. The chickens aren't. So they'd get a chicken, they put a chicken on the top so that when they look in it, they go, yeah, that's all right. Got a bag full of chicken. They'd get home to make the dinner and they'd be like, what, we happen tonight? And they'll go, well, you'll never guess. And they'd have like, you know, well, you can have a chicken leg and. You know, they'd have to defrost a pizza. Did they mind that they were eating cat then in those days? He didn't say it just was saying about the saying, don't let the cat out of the bag. It's like, you know, if they see that, they're gonna go mad. I'm mildly disappointed with this story. It's all right if it's true. But, you know, there's something about it. It's just. I want to know more. He always leaves it. Is it. Carl doesn't quench your thirst for knowledge. He creates more. I don't know if that's a good thing or not. Well, yeah, he's like the pot noodle of information. Yeah. He never. I want to go. I'm not nourished by it. For every fact he tells me, there's 10 others that spring up that I have to get clear. So it was the people that were doing this. It was the. It was the dodgy butchers that coined this phrase. Were they saying to each other, don't let the cow at the back. I. E. What I mean by that, Jack, is don't let them see the cat. Yeah. What we stuffed in there. Yeah. Dodgy butcher. There's another phrase, isn't it? So that's. That's the first one. Is that euphemism? Yeah. As is meat delivered around the back. Sure. So that's. That's that one. So let's get your kit on. What's that? It's a euphemism for homosexuality. Okay. Okay. And meat, presumably in. That means different things. It doesn't it. It's. It's a word that is also a male. Wouldn't mean chicken or cat necessarily in that context or. Well, I suppose it could. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Carl's look. Just looks. Look at him. It. Carl looks at you like a cat. Whenever we leave him behind, if we don't talk, like straight at him and let him see our lips moving and it's, you know, monosyllabic and very easily. Look, he's lost. He's lost in that conversation there. He just drifted off, didn't you, Carl? No, I just was also thinking on animals and that something else was going to use. Go on. Was. This isn't a radio show, is it? I just suddenly caught myself. This is not. This is nothing before. It's. It's been bad today. No, but I mean, it's the way that this casual way that it's like we almost have no regard for our listener. And I'm not proud of that. I just don't know what to do about it. You know what I mean? I don't know how to do this properly. I mean, we're just chatting here. I mean, it's only Anderson who's seen through us. And that surprises me that more people haven't. I mean, what are the figures like? Do people listen to this show? I'll find out for you. You keep saying that, but yeah. There's this parrot, apparently. I mean, Rick, it's unique if nothing else. I mean, when you wake up with woken tomorrow, you're not even gonna hear him start alive. There was this parrot. Go on. There was this parrot. Yeah, go on. And it can talk and that. Someone's obviously, you know, tore it out speaking that and it flew away. And it's living in this church, right. And people are at the church doing hymns and that. And then trouble's brewing in between. If that parrot was owned by an old miner who used to swear a lot, well then the vicar is gonna be. Is gonna be really annoyed. That vicar. That vicar's gonna. Go on. I just hope he stays quiet, Rick, during the vicar sermons. Yeah, go on, have you read it? No. Go on, have you read it? That's what happens during the hymns. It's sort of effing and jeffing and stuff and everyone's like going, oh, you know, it's quite funny really. You know, it doesn't know what it's doing. Everyone's having a laugh. Yeah. But it's causing a havoc at funerals. Where did this happen? Not years ago. John was a much loved man. He was a wanker. Yeah. So anyway, so that was another story. What can you say about Uncle John? Bollocks. Oh, Carl, I love. I love the fact that when you look at things, you go, that's interesting. The parrot swears at funerals and it stays with you. You see, for a simple man, you retain an awful lot of knowledge. It's just all rubbish, you know what I mean? If you just replaced all this rubbish with good stuff, you'd be an intellectual, really, because, I mean, your attention is fantastic. Yeah. So did I lose you again there, did I? So was it the word retention? We've still got wash up with you. Yeah. Yeah. Should we play a record and do wash up with you. Yeah. We'll play a bit of aqua lunga lung. All right. That's aqua Long good times gonna come in it. Right, Carl, coming in. Educating Ricky. So don't let the cat out of the bag. That's where that comes from. Comes from a crafty butcher. Right, go on in. So the next little headline is wash up with you. What's up with you? Go on. You want to know about that? Yes, it's a survey that they did. Survey that they did this week. They. Yeah, some. Some university did some survey. Brilliant. Did a world test on washing up. Yeah. And each country were given 140 pots to clean. Brits were the quickest. Yeah, yeah. Turkey were the slowest. Washing up the Turks. It's not because the little fellas that work in the kitchens with no. So is it big outreach? Spain. Spain were the cleanest. And the Germans were pretty good as well. So I don't know where to start with this. Honestly, Steve, I don't know where to start with that. It was really light, right, We've had the parrot, right? These are things that I found. Found the parrot, right? I've told you about the dog in the car wash, right? You didn't tell me about that. You said there's a car wash for a dog. That's what you told me. Yeah, the parrot. You said there's a parrot. What? It's a problem at funerals. That's nothing. That's nothing. There's nothing. Do you understand? And they used to eat cats. What else have we got? There's an elephant in India with saw feet. Why? There's an elephant in India with sore feet. I'm interested. Why? Tap dancing. Why? See, I didn't realize. He's trying to break Roy Castle's record. What is it? What is it? Think it's an elephant. And it was really old. It was about 76, right. And it had sore feet because it's old and they don't make. Stairs are bad and that. So they said what we're gonna do? And the town was like, oh, you know, we're used to seeing it around. It's part of the thing, you know, we don't want it to have sore feet. So they got some slippers made for it and it had like a picture of the elephant looking happy, wearing some slippers. I love him. I love Carl. His world. Think. Where'd you see this picture? That was on the Internet. Right. That's a lesson, though, for any elephants listening. You know, don't wear stilettos to work every day because you can do your. Don't elephants have really bad memories? No, they have really good memories. Oh, do they? Yeah. That's good then. I just thought they forget where they put them. I thought there was something about elephants having bad, bad memories. It goes on. Where's my slippers? Yeah, I Sure. I left them by the text, so. Sorry. There's a. They're there for walking around carrying slippers. Yeah, yeah, there's. That's in India slippers. Those sort of old man ones with the sort of check. Well, round ones, I imagine. Yeah, yeah, Big round ones. There was that going on and is it happening? Is it happier I mean, does it feel nice? It looked it. Please. What else is there? There's a woman who's had a. Had a breast insure for 150 grand. Right, okay. What? Third party fire and theft? Don't know. It just said it had a picture of her with them, like, you know, out. I just thought, yeah, he should get them covered. He's done another real joke. Brilliant. That's a proper joke. Look at his little face. He smiles. I'd like to see you on one of the sort of TV panel games if they could bring back sort of celebrity squares. Yeah, he'd be amazing as the center square. Oh, that would be incredible. Or on Countdown in Dictionary Corner. Dictionary, I imagine. Dictionary Corner. Well, I'll come up with cat. Yeah, Memdlent. Yeah. What does that mean, Carl? Just anything you want it to mean. And what I've got. There's a dog that's got a cough in Singapore because it smokes 20 a day. Right, okay. Another one. No, no, no, that's the last one in it, so I'll save it. The last one we've got is why I don't. Sorry, what was that? Wash up with you? That was it. But they stayed. Was that it? The surveyor washing pot Too much. I didn't understand. You said who. You said Italy were the cleanest. No, Spain. No. Brits were the quickest. Yeah, we were the quickest. But Italy was the. Spain was the cleanest. Turkey were the slowest. Yeah, Spain were the cleanest. But why weren't we cleane. We were washing it. Why were we not paying attention to the. We did it. Rubbish. We did it quick. We did it quickly. But. But I don't understand what it was. Who was doing it. Was it Lynette Newman or Einsley? Harry, she's quick. Both of them are quick. Yeah, well, they've got like kind of slaves that do it for him. Did we. Did we use. Did we use Fairy liquid? No, it didn't. It didn't happen. Did we use a whole bunch of boy scape? Didn't say that. It just said, you know, that, that. That who had the softest hands. So I didn't say. I didn't. Why is it we don't get notified that this is taking place? I don't know. When I was a kid, no one ever said, you know, we need recruits because we're. We're doing a survey on who can wash up the quickest. Are you disappointed in yourself with that one, Carl? It is pretty dull, to be fair. And that is why We've got to bring in either Con merchant or a wine merchant or shut up at your face. Yeah. Would you be able to. If I asked, if I put you on the spot in the next, sort of after the next record, would you be able to give an example of how Con Merchant would work? I mean, is there something you could do? Do just sort of exp. Play record. Should we play record? I can do better than that. What? Ads go on XFM. Travis on XFM 104.9 R with me, Steve Merchant, Carl P. To me doing Educating Ricky. Right, final one. Come on, Carl. Right, what was it? It was. Why don't they just get a diary or some paper or something to write on? Yeah, yeah, because nappy. I couldn't. Well, I couldn't think of a heading for it. It's basically gone. People who have tattoos have never understood it. Right. That they have something put on their arm. Right, sorry, have we started? The educator. Is this part of it? Are you educating me? This is something that I will be useful in my life that I didn't know about. Yeah, go on, then. No, it's just like they've got. They've got a machine out, right, that does tattoos. You come up with a design you want and you sort of. It. This machine scans it and you put your arm in this thing and you press print or whatever and then it does the tattoo on your hand or on your. Loads of little needles that follow a pattern. Yeah, basically, yeah. Is it a real tattoo? It's a broad. It's a proper one. The fella said, well, as long as. It goes out, it pierces the skin with it. I just wondered if it's one of those kind of, you know, those kind of. It must be lots of. Lots of little needles or moving needle that can go. How is this cleaned, like in between each person? Dunno. Probably. I don't know. Well, no, it's not. It's only that if it's one needle, it's just the head, isn't it? If it's one needle that moves and does it, like. Like loads of little. What are we gaining from a machine. Doing it just because, you know they're gonna sort of mess it up. But hold on, how would you keep your arms still? Because your skin moves like it's a. Machine sort of straps to your arm. Right. The tricky thing was in all this, it was the fact that, you know, nobody would let him test it out on anyone else, so he had to do it himself. But did it work? Because the thing is With a tattoo, they can see when your skin's moved and they can see what they've done. They keep wiping it and looking. Whereas a machine's just got to trust itself. So I think one needle would. Could go wrong if it was a lot. Any other. Just that it just came down like, you know, a thousand needles. That was an impression print. Yeah, but obviously I'm asking someone who's. Hasn't delved any further than there's a machine that can give you a tattoo. That's all you've got at the moment, isn't it? Well, I'm. Yeah, that's what you've got. I mean, that's. That's what I've got. Because I'm not a fan of tattoos. I don't. But where did you read this again? This was Internet. This was on the Internet? Yeah, it was, yeah. Okay. And I just don't understand why people do it. That's. That's what got me attention, because me. So what have I learned from this? That if you wanted to get one, you know, you can get one done by a machine now, you know, people say machines are sort of taken over and that, and. And there's another one, but it's just the fact. I mean, I don't know. So give us the snappy title of this. This education. Why don't they just get a diary or some paper or something to write it on? That's why I always think when I see people with. With loads of tattoos, like, there's that fellow we were talking about the other week in Scotland. It was covered 99 in tatt. It's just like, what have you done that for? Yeah. So, I mean, you can't get rid of it now. You've. You've done it now. Yeah. My. One of my uncles, right, Tattoo Stan, he. He. He's just caked in them. Right. I don't think he's my proper uncle, but it's just like. That's a province in Russia, isn't it? My dad's got loads of mates who. When you say he's not your proper uncle. Uncle stuff. Yeah. I mean, and it was like. It was. My dad had loads of mates like that. There was John the Screw, right. So he either worked in a prison or he liked to have sex. Cabby. Cab driver. Okay. It was Jimmy the Hat. I don't know why he. Jimmy the Hat, Yeah. Did he wear a hat? No, no. There was. There was Fred the Veg. Sure he wasn't a relative? Sorry. Fred the Veg used To get us like big bags of potatoes and that's. And it was. There was Tattoo Stan and he was just caked in them. And I used to always look at him thinking, why have you done that? I must have only been like, you. Know, I suppose if you're born with a name like Tattoo Stan. Exactly. You're desperate. Really. Like a 1950s gang. I'm worried about. I'm worried about doing a bank job. What was his name? The Hat. What was his name? Jimmy the Hat. I'm worried about Jimmy the Hat. Yeah. Not having a hat. I don't understand it. Are you sure he didn't have a hat hat? Not when I met him. Did he ever wear a hat? I didn't see him that much. Do you think it was a joke? Like, we know when your mate sort of like, you know, eight foot and huge, you call him Little John or Tiny. Do you think he never was? Yeah. They went, hold on, I've noticed something about Jim, go on, no hat. And I go, true, let's call him Jim the Hat. Jimmy the Hat. Yeah. But me, my Uncle Stan, he had like loads of them. He did. Did them himself. Oh, dear. And it was always. What was it? Things like. It was. He had like the across cut, cut. Here, Made in Britain. And if you're going to do them yourself, I'd say at least make sure you're sort of a good drawer. Yeah. And don't do it in a mirror so it comes out backwards. Well, that, that was the other thing. But like I remember he did. I mean, names are all right. He had like all his kids names down his arm. What are they called? Yeah. Oh, Tattoo Stan junior. Yeah. And Paul Shits to bed. Oh, wa. By Kate. Yeah. Yeah. Frankie never amounts to anything. Oh, God. So he had like. Johnny. I don't think he's mine. So he did all this. I don't even know why I'm telling you about. No, nor do I. Carl. Hey, to be honest, I don't know that if. I don't know if maybe you just have to picture this, but my picture. My sister took a hat to take a photo when she was working in like a factory. Not to denigrate people who work in factories, but there happened to be a particularly oddball, kind of lank haired, weird guy living, working in this factory and he made his own. He did his own tattoos and she took a photo of it because she was so extraordinary he'd drawn it himself. Now, bear in mind, it was the kind of thing you saw when you were Doing art when you were like 15. This is the sort of person who designed their own, like, rock. Heavy rock album cover. Yeah, he's that sort of person. So, I mean, dragon with breasts. You're not far off, Rick. No, you're not far off. I'll tell you what it was. He had this tattooed on his back. It took up his entire back. She took a photo of it for. He drew it himself. He had it tattooed himself. And it was just too much detail. Too much detail for a tattoo. It needs to be fairly simple, I think, to make a tattoo. It was. It was a naked female vampire having a shower. Why was she having a shower? Having a shower. That's why she was naked. Yeah. And so she. Had she been out? She was. Presumably she'd been out a lot of blood. Yeah, well, she was naked, so you could see her naked body. She's quite a beautiful vampire relative, relatively speaking. Yeah. Although the symmetry of her face was somewhat off. Yeah. The only thing I think that gave her the bad spine was that she had. She did have some pointed teeth. I think that was how you knew she was a vampire. Right. Was she looking. She was having a shower. Was, yeah. Very interesting, isn't it? He said to the. I said, listen, I. I want a naked bird, right, But I don't want to be gratuitous. He goes, well, you can put her in a shower. Because then they went. That least gives some kind of. That's the plot. I mean, you know, it's justified within the story. She's in a show. Sure, sure. Okay. Yeah, yeah, we'll have that car. So. Yeah. Okay. Any other nicknames your friends of your family had? What was your nickname? Carl? Just Pilky. Because for a minute I thought Carl the veg would have made a lot of sense. Yeah. Carla veg. And what, What. Why has your dad got a little tattoo, dopey twat on his arm? Right. We'll do the answers to Rockbusters next year. Buzzcocks. Still sounds brilliant, that. It is a crap. They're from Manchester as well, Carl, so they've got a little bit of pride there. Hey, I think one of them's one of my mates. Dads. Really? Yeah, I think so. What's his nickname? Well, his name was. I don't want anyone to say his name. Okay. Laurie, his first name was. Yeah. Still is, probably. Yeah. Well, you know those little fellas at Score that didn't know each other, weren't related and weren't friends. Could it be too obvious that they had webbed Hands and Big Heads. Yeah. What were they? Did they have any nicknames again? Too obvious, isn't it? Go on. Well. Oh, Big Head or, you know. Sure. Oh, I bet you got that juggling or Frog twins. Yeah. Can I just interrupt you guys because we've just had an email here. I hate to query you, Carl, and you're educating Ricky section, because I know you put a lot. Don't read this. Let me just read it for you. Just had an email here from Olivia and this is also being corroborated by someone else. I forget who it was. She was just. She just tuned in and she just heard you explaining the expression letting the cat out of the bag. So it's all to do with cats that were put in bags by dodgy butchers. Possibly the 17th century, we're not too sure. Anyway, she claims. Well, let me see. She says. She uses both the words twaddle and crap in relation to your definition. She says letting the cat out the bag is an old shipping expression from when sailors used to get flogged for their misdemeanors. The cat is the cat, which is. A kind of whip thing that you. They used to keep hanging in a bag below deck. If it was discovered that a sailor had done something wrong, the cat would be let out of the bag and get a whipping. Don't let the cat in the bag. We need to cover something up. She's talking nonsense. No, she's not. That's the truth. Because the one I read about that was, there's not enough room in here to swing a cat. Right. And that was people who worked on a boat. Yeah, well, that's fine. They could have. They're not going to keep going on about people working on a boat. Boat to get those. You can't have two phrases about the. Same thing to do with their time. Think. So many just coming up with stuff. Think how many metaphors have birds in them. And you know, it's ridiculous. Why can't you have. You can have as many sounds as you like about anything, Carl. There's not a rule. They don't go, we've made one up about the cat and nine tails. Well, cheers for that, Oliver. Olivia. Olivia. Yeah. Don't see your email coming up with a Rock Busters answer. Answers. So give us the answers. Let's give them out. The first one was. You've been dunking that for too long. That was lb, Limp Biscuit. Yeah, I got that one. The third one, we'll jump to that one because you've got it well, I've had a rubbish day, so I'm happy it's all over. That was GK That's a great one. That's glad it's night, Gladys Knight. Glad it's night. That is brilliant, Carl. And the one that you're both having a problem with. You won't be able to play that game in this pub. The table ain't big enough. Fd. Go on. Fats Domino. Yeah. What? The dominoes? You play dominoes in a pub? The. The dominoes. Fat. Pub tables are quite small. You won't be able to play that game in this pub. Fat's Domino. Rubbish. So do you want to pick a winner? Rubbish. Well, you say it's rubbish, but plenty of people got the right answer. Rubbish. Who do you want to go with? The bunch of slightly rubbish prizes is going to Elliot. Ken from Chigwell in Essex. Well done. To Elliot. I. I just can. Before we go, can we just get a little email off Anders? Because I think he must. I think we probably turned him around with this show. I thought so. I think he's going to be saying. Coming to us with his tail between his legs, saying, sorry, lads. Blinding show. I was wrong. You were right. Yep. Yeah. All right. Song for the lovers is very exciting. We haven't had a song for the. The lovers or the ladies for quite some time. Let's combine the two and about John Martin. May you never. Let's end with this. We'll see you next. Next time. See ya. Bye. Lay your head down.",
