Now come on, let's get my name right from now on that. That novelty's worn off. What is it? Is it Steve Merchant? Oh, yeah, Vegas. That's the wrong one, isn't it? The Guardian got it wrong. It's Steve Merchant. And the more I say Mitchell, the more people are thinking, exactly, it might be Mitchell. Oh, God. Sorry, Dave, but Carl wanted to start off with a Stereophonics. Oh, loser. Because it was a newer track. And Carl, now we've made him what he is. He was nothing when we found him. He was like working and now he's. Going, oh, we should start off with stereo fans. I'm going, trying to tell you what to do. If I want anyone's opinion, I don't. Basically probably come to me. I imagine before Carl, I'd consult you, Steve. Thank you. Just keep it just because he was in the. What is it? Pilgrim music Pilk is making. I bet you never pleased a crowd. Once. Loads of times. Go on then, what did you play? What's your biggest gig you ever played? I did like a social club gig. Yeah. And it wasn't just about the music either. What else could it be about? I used to take prizes and cigars. And stuff in a youth club to give away. I just love these like 14 year old Manx hanging out, going, let's go down here. You might have some fags and cigars for us. Well, it was whatever light was on my mum and dad's dressing table. That could have been embarrassing, couldn't it? Could have been deeply embarrassing. You've won. And third party, some handcuffs and a black mamba. I'm not saying that at any point in your upbringing your parents left around any kind of marital aid on the dressing table. Don't think I'm saying that, Carl. I'm not suggesting. He doesn't like this, does he? Well, no, I can understand why. Oh, yeah. Because it's about his parents having sex. Well, they must have. Yeah, at least three times. I think I was an accident. I think it's been ongoing. Just because my brother and sister are quite older than me. Yeah, me too. I was an accident. I know that. Yeah. How old's your brother and sister? I think My sister's about 39. Right. And my brother's about 37. Okay. And you're 29. 29. Right. So, yeah, my next one's 11 years older than me. Yeah, that was definitely a. Do you want to have a hug, you two, or. Yeah, yeah. Dealing with it now. You got. Well, would you like to see us have our go. You had a mobile disco. You had a laugh, aren't you? I was. I. Every single gig I did dynamite. People loved it. It was storming. What. What was it called? I ran it from about the age of 14 to 18. What was it called? Was it called in the name of our mobile disco? Yeah. It had two names in its lifetime. Yeah. It started its life as. Bear with it. Go on. The rock and roll DJs. Oh, my God, the rock and roll DJ. That's the worst. I mean, that's the worst. Yeah, that's the most appalling. But then it became pretty bad after that when it became the Fantasy Island Roadshow. Why? I don't know. Because everyone up to you looked like Tattoo. Partly that. And I. Because I liked the programme Fantasy Island. Why did you like the programme Fantasy Island? Well, it was about love on an island. In one sense, it was about a midget on an island. No, the midget was a minor character about people going to find yourself on the characters. You obviously switched off once to. Had gone off and said, there's the plane. Oh, that's that. Then your parents went, that's over then. It's only five minutes long. Yeah, well, it's. Let's watch that fantasy. Yeah. What happened then? Because didn't they. They acted out their fancies on the. Night people would pay to go to the island to live out their own romantic fantasies. And invariably. That's always. It was always about getting. It was a kind of love island. Yeah. Was it? Well, no, not always. Sometimes they might be. Maybe I didn't watch a hard one. Maybe I did just see him, like, smack a little tattoo around the head. I think you just saw the trailer. Oh, really? So what did I sort of go, I've always wanted to have someone in. Well, no, it might be something like, you know, I've always wanted to. To sort of, you know, live out being a gunslinger in a wild west frontier town, you know, so you might kind of create that. But what's that got to do with. Well, invariably would find love or he'd sort out some emotional problem he had. It was much more a spiritual emotional journey than it was about little midgets running around. But was it like, oh, I'd like to be a cowboy and like, remember the shag? Yeah, it was like those letters you wrote did you want to fix it? I'd like to meet five star and if something happens, so be well. But no. I have to just say once, though, just about my. This is my DJing credentials. I was once playing music at a scout jamboree. Yeah. When I was about 17, 16. It was a thousand scouts there. Yeah, right. They. And I tell you this, we were playing on stuff. They were loving it. They were dancing. It was in a big marquee, right. I slapped on Smells Like Teen Spirit. Yeah, right. I went mad. They went mad for it. They were. They were moshing. They were climbing up the poles. The organizers were going, switch that off, switch that off. Right. They're going crazy. And I was there going, no, that's what they like, I'm gonna do it. It was like Footloose. It was unbelievable. It was just like. Then I came in with Reggie Machine killing in the name of the place went wild and they were trying to get me off the decks. It was like Bill. It was like Bill Grundy interviewing the Sex Pistol. And then when. When the head had you killed? Exactly. Some sort of mafia thing. It was all hushed up. That the scouts went there one night with all candles and they stood by a grave and that. And that was the end of the film. It was a film. I assume it genuinely happened. I assume this didn't really happen. Yes, it did. I swear to God. I was playing Smiles Like Teen Spirit and it went wild and the organisers were going, switch that off. They're going crazy. And I was going, no, it's what they want. Can I say something? It was brilliant. That to me, I've known you for about four years and I've heard all these things. That must be the highlight of your life. Unbelievably so, yeah. You've never had anything that good or exciting since, have you? One day I hope to sleep with a lady and hopefully that'll. It'll slide into second place. Class. Rock the cassette. I love the fact that you. You had at least three minutes to get that right. I know. Pair and get that right. I know, but my mouth was full of Maryland cookies. Yeah. You know, last week this is. Oh, this will blow your mind. He came in. Do you know what he'd bought for himself? About 10 penguins. He buys penguins still? No. All Wagon Wheels. Oh, I've never liked Wagon Wheels. You not been a fan? No, no, but I'm sorry about that. It's the Clash and Rock the Casbar talking about records. If I told you that time, my brother in law he was moving out of his place, I think, moving in. My sister and I was about, like, I don't know, 13 until he was about 30 and I moved it. And he brought around all his records when he was storage to leave him at our house. And he had all these old sort of records, 50s and 60s records. No, I was right. And. And they put him upstairs and I was looking through them and it's just all like Elvis stuff and beetle stuff. And there was a mate of mine who loved Elvis. Okay. And he had loads of chemicals. Yeah, he had loads of chemicals. And I was into chemistry and he said I swapped me some chemicals for them. So I sort of nicked about five Elvis singles and I got all these chemicals. And then. Just guilt. What sort of chemicals? Just things like, you know, just things like from a chemistry set, just, you know, crystals and metals and magnesium, all that sort of stuff that I just like to muck around with. And. And. And then the guilt just hit me. I just thought, well, he's gonna notice that. And I just. One night I just came downstairs and I confessed to my mum and she went, all right, well, I won't tell him, but you've got to be good. And it's sort of like I was just really, really good for a year, and then. And then I was. I told this. No, no, no, you haven't. You've just reminded me of something. And then I remember when I was about 18, my brother was talking about it and he said, did you ever play those records I left for you? Brilliant. He told my mum, he said, these are for Ricky. She just didn't. She was sharp, wouldn't she? Opportunism. There. Oh, that's genius. And that was it. That's. That's why I was good. But you've never. You've never stolen anything since, have you? No, I don't. I don't. I don't. Except that spate of shoplifting after that. To teach your mum a lesson. Yeah, yeah. Well, I went round and. Arson. No, no, I did. I. I just couldn't believe it. I just. Oh, I remember. And I think all kids go through a phase of shoplifting. Well. And when I was going through it, I used to just. Just little things, just like magic markers and magazines, Mars bars, that sort of thing. Yeah, and cigars and dildos. And one day, right, same thing that me mate Anthony, his mom called up my mum and said, I've got to. I've got to meet up with you. I've got to have a word with You. And she said, what about? She said, I don't want to talk about it over the phone. So she goes, oh, right, well, yeah, come around tonight then. So anyway, my mum sees me, she didn't want to be in an awkward position and like, be a bit embarrassed and what have you. So she sees me and she goes, right, Anthony's mam's coming round. What have you been doing? Yeah. So I go, oh, God. I said, I've been nicking stuff. So she goes, like, what? So not big stuff. I've had a few calculators and Mars bars and stuff. How many? I'll just work it out. Hold on. Works out at 7.2 per day. So how many calculators do you need? So it was when that failed, you. Failed math, didn't you? Everyone wanted a calculator. It was like a trendy thing, wasn't it? Oh, yeah, in Manchester a couple of years ago. Yeah, so. So anyway, so I told her all this and I confessed. Computers will make it there. Won't confess to magic in the back of battery. Go on, confess to Nick and all this stuff. She comes round, she only wanted to borrow some money. Brilliant. I don't like asking. I was a bit embarrassed to ask you over the phone, but can I borrow 20 quid? Oh, that's fantastic. And there's me. That's great. And it's similar sort of thing to yours. Did you. He went, hold on, I'm let you work out the interest on that. I bank 10%, she'll owe you £4 40. So your mum was a loan shark? Yeah, yeah. And did she mention she went with that other. Because what I'm saying is, presumably you got your mate in trouble. No, no, no, she went, no worries. I'll just go and get my purse. It's on the dressing table. Exactly, yeah. Carl, do you want a cigar? What other things you used to give away at your disco then, that you'd find on the dressing table? You used to go into your parents room and go, what can I give away tonight? It was stuff like cigars, dad. Light cigars. I had a pair of tights. What do you mean unopened? You know, you get them in like a long. Who did you give that to? Just whoever did the prize. It was stuff like, you know, we did like a little raffle. Just imagine who's going. Joyride, Pretty Polly share. Exactly. He was doing a bank job this week. Exactly. That's what it was used for. Yeah, just little bits, you know, unopened makeup. Just stuff like that. And did their parents not notice? No, because it's stuff that you're not that bothered about him. If a telly went missing, they'd notice it. They wouldn't. They. They'd be staring at a wall for three days. But a pair of tights and a cigar and that get away with it? Yeah, but it's. It's funny as well because like, you had. You had two names. I just like, remembered I started off as Dazzling Darren's Disco, just because the first lights I could afford belonged to someone who had their name put in. Lights. Right. So I went along with that. To pretend you were called Darren. That's lovely. That's crazy. Is it worth it? Brilliant. And then it went on to Pilkins making music. Yeah, that's great. And actually we have some more music because. Yeah. What were you gonna play, Carl? We've got the Cooper Temple clause. Oh, brilliant. Yes. Steve Merchant here. Steve Merchant. Yeah. Okay, don't keep saying it. And Carl, obviously. Yeah, now we've stopped fiddling, Carl. We've been digging around in Carl's office, haven't we? As ever, Rick. He's a little bit nervous about this. Well, he doesn't need to be. I don't think he is. You just need to trust us, Kyle. Just trust us. Trust us. The music. Trust us with the speech output. Trust. Yeah, that's easy for me to say. Yeah. But I just. I'm conscious, Rick, that sometimes perhaps we're a little ill prepared on the show. And I just wanted to make sure that we were sort of keeping ourselves abreast of developments, changes at the station. Policy. Thanks. You know, policies particularly. And I was lucky enough just to stumble across this and I feel that actually a couple of weeks back we were a little ill prepared because we hadn't read this. Yeah. This is the XFM information. It's the guidelines, if you will, surely, on how to react to deaths, disasters and other news emergencies. Yeah. And there's this very important ones, like a royal death. There's like, you know. Well, there's certain clues here. I mean, obviously the general guidelines state that occasionally something will happen in the world that prompts XFM to break away from the normal programming and react to our audience's feelings of shock or grief. As broadcasters, we have a duty to think about our show there. Are they talking about something happening? No, all shows, I mean. No, no, not people being caused grief. Just Carl's on the air. Right. You mean like, you know, I mean a bigger. Even a royal dying a royal darling. Or Some kind of, you know, major disaster. Sure. We should be able to tailor our output to show that we feel the same way as the audience in these times of trouble. That would never involve the station shutting down completely, Rick. No, I want to reassure you of that now. And it would never involve playing classical music or stopping all speech content. Sure. Because a lot of. Because they put that in there. Because a lot of stations. That's exactly what they do. Exactly. But have deemed it that we don't have to go completely down the line there. We have to do it. People need company at times like this. Yeah. And should be able to look to us for both factual information and emotional reaction. Sure. We simply have to change our tone and our playlist to show that we're all feeling the same thing. Be it, oh my God, I can't believe this is happening. Or. Well, it's pretty sad, but she was 101 after all. And that's actually in that. That's what it actually says in the general guidelines. That's as they are stated. If you should hear about the death of a major royal. Yeah. This is information that you're actually reading. This, by the way. Yeah, I'm reading this out. What you should do is say nothing about this on. On air under any circumstances. Drop all the ads and promos from your schedule. And if Chris Smith, the news guy is in the building, get him in the studio immediately. Yeah, that's what it says, Kyle. Yeah. If Smitty is. I don't care where he is, I don't care if he's on holiday. Let's phone him up now and tell him someone's died to see how he would react. Get him down here. Get him down here. See how long it takes him to get down here. Where does Smitty live? Because I know where he lives. He lives in a cave and he slides down a pole and he gets into a car. His butler is up there and he. And he sorts things out. I suppose the approach there is that only Chris can deliver this tragic news. Yeah. If it was you or I. Yeah, it would. It wouldn't. It wouldn't have the same. I remember. Do you remember the XFM as it first started? It launched the day after Princess Diana died. I know, I know. And I've never done radio before. I was nervous enough and it was launched and it was. Oh, was it? Was it the first night? Because what I forgotten actually until you mentioned that then is of course you used to host your own phone in show. And I gave that up after a Week, because it was just too stressful. I have never seen a man so petrified. I know he spent all his time preventing people getting through on the phone lines. Yeah. He just wouldn't let people come on air. When I had to go on air, right, my mates sort of like, came over the first day and they were mucking around and I was having a drink with them where I used to work. I was going to go on air in a minute and I was like drinking shandy or something because I was saying, I don't want to be drunk. And I kept saying, don't swear, telling my mates not to swear. They look at me like I was mental. I was going, don't swear because I'll swear. I was terrified of two things. Just swearing and. And operating the desk. I thought, I'm gonna. Even if I get through operating the desk, I'm gonna swear. And it just. Oh, it was. It was awful. Didn't you. Didn't you spill coffee over the machine and then go, oh, shit, on your first link? I can't remember, but I know it wasn't a triumph. No, I started off with. I was doing a lot of music and I started off with a classical piece by a bloke called Kuntz, who's a. A German composer. Brilliant. So I. I knew it was. It was. Okay, you're off, you're off. Yeah, but. And so how did it go then? Because I remember it was appalling. Look, Carl, he's a composer. Look it up. Yeah, I know he is. Right. Oh, eight. 700, 800. 1, 2, 3, 4. If you know what the composer. I'm talking. What? Yeah, we've done it. We've done it now. Chill out, Carl. Come on. You know what people are like. What? You take things badly. Don't. They just. It's like a bull to a red rag. Whatever. The thing is that we say bad words and we get in trouble. But I was listening to Heart the other day and they played Luther Vandross, and that. That song was it. Never too much. Never too much. Playoff it. The lyric in this is dis. Disgusting. Woke up today Looked at your picture just to get me started. Hear that? Woke up today Looked at your picture just to get me started. That's filthy. Play it again. That is filthy. What a filth. What is he doing just saying like that. Imagine that he's got a young girl's picture and he's going, oh, thanks for that. And he phones up and goes, what did today. You know that picture you gave me? She Goes, yeah. He goes, well, I looked at it just to get me started. That poor young woman. I imagine more that, like, she's sleeping and he just sneaks in and just. He's got a Polaroid camera. She wakes up, he goes, what are you doing? She goes, what up to? He goes, no, I'm just taking a picture. Well, why? I'm going to write somewhere tomorrow. Will you? Yeah. You're going on holiday tomorrow, aren't you? Yeah, well, I. I need that. Just need something to get me started. What do you mean, get you started? Yeah, you know, in the morning and. Then that's on heart. All right, 6.2. So don't come on air and tell us what we can say. We can't say. We can't say classical composers names or philosophers like Kant. Exactly. So don't tell us that, Carl. All right? Just play a record. What you got, Steve? Yeah. I just think it's time that we listen to some ride. Rick. We haven't listened to him. I don't know about you and I, but I haven't listened to them to any for about six, seven weeks. Yeah. Just thought it'd be good to have him on the air again and it's a tragedy they split up. This is the classic Chelsea Girl. Play it. I know, yeah. But influenced lots of bands at that time, the old Brit pop thing and the Wall of Sound and they weren't, were they, Shoe Glazers, do you think? They were, weren't they? Well, that's what they thought of because there's a lot of nude guitar, but good melodies as well, Rick. And that's always important. It is to me. I don't know about you, Carl, but it is important to us. We've just had a couple of people, Sarah and Claire, call up and wish us luck for the baftas, but for some reason they want one of us to do an impression of Leslie Phillips. Can't do. Doesn't say ding dong and hello and all that. That's not bad. But I want. I want Kyle to do it, though. Yeah, go on, Carl, go on. Hello. Well done. Say ding dong. Ding dong. Nice. Yeah. Do you do any other impressions? No. Hello. Do that. Hello. Yeah. You look like a ventriloquist dummy. Brilliant. Oh, God. Do. My name is Bond, James Bond, as though it were Sean Connery. James Bond. Do that. Go on. My name's Bond. No, do it as though you were doing an impression, Sean. I'm. What? So I'm trying to be Scottish. Well, yeah. Well, yeah, sort of. Perhaps a bit More specific than that. Sean Connery. My name's Bond. Keep going. My name's Bond. James Bond. Thanks, Jimmy Stewart. It's not like this. This is the best fun. It's like having your very own Fisher Price toy for two hours a week. It's great. Do Roger Moore. Do that. Roger Moore. Phyllis Pierce. Percy Sugden. I'm licensed to kill. Anyway, she just said no. This is a great game. We'll come back to this another time. Anything you want, Karl to do. Carl's homework today was come up with those. You know, those lateral thinking things go on, those stupid. Oh, I hate that. They're ridiculous, aren't they? A man went into a field and died, and you're meant to ask questions like, oh, was it. It turns out his parish didn't open. So it's basically. It's not logic, it's, what am I thinking? Well, there's that one where there's a man in. This is the worst I've ever heard. A man is found dead lying in a phone box. Right. His wrists are cut, he's bled to death, and there's glass everywhere. Yeah, right. And the phone's hanging off. Yeah, right. Yeah. What happened to him? I know this. Yeah, right. Do you know what the answer is, Carl? It's ridiculous. He was a fisherman. Yeah. He was on the phone. Someone asked him how big his fish was. He did that gesture, like fishermen always do, to say it was much bigger. Than actually his arms out. His arms went through the glass, and he slashed his wrists, and he died. Why would you do that with someone on the phone when they can't see how. How big you're actually saying? Well, that's one of the many problems with that. That conundrum. Yeah. Not the point we were making, but again, good. I mean, you're there. That is good thinking. Yeah. Yeah. But so what, you had to come up with some of these? I didn't know this was his challenge. Yeah. Have you come up with one? I came up with three, and they're all belters. Are we gonna. Oh, well, if it's as good as your quote about happiness that we had to guess which was yours and which was the real ones, like, faking it. I cannot wait. I'm looking forward to this. I mean, I literally can't wait. Should we do it now? Well, I'm tempted to save it because I just want to mention to people that they should be very excited because it's gonna be Carl's special night tomorrow. You excited, Carl? Oh, yeah. Oh, this is yeah, me and Steve, because we're nominated, we get a guest for the basketball and it's. It doesn't say guest, it actually says, you know, partner. So I'm taking my partner and Steve's taking Carl. Yeah, but what Carl doesn't realize is you will have to pretend you're his partner, otherwise you won't be able to hold his hands. Is this your, is this really your partner? It's not just a guest. That's how it is. Neither we go in like that or we can't get in. You have to, you just have to be with him when you go up there. I mean, does he have to hold it? You should, we should hold hands. But I think what we should do is just to make sure that there's nothing at all that like it's going to go wrong, we should just do. A little kiss, just like be seen, sort of like cheek to cheek. Just to show them that, yeah, you know, you're not like Elton John and David. He's not just getting his mates in for a free meal. You are actually partners. No, I'm not for that. Why not? Well, because we know we're not actually gay, but. Yeah, so it's not a problem. You've come out of it looking quite good because you've got a good looking fella. But I'm meant to look like, you know, I mean, I'm not gay, but if I was, I don't think I'd go for yourself. Oh, he's done you, Steve. It's turned on you again. I cannot believe we were trying to get him. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I have got the cream of London's totty phoning me up trying to get an invite to the baftas. Yeah, right. We have very graciously asked you if you would like to come along. Well, that worries me even more that you've got women calling you up. Carl, Carl. I can't choose between them. If I let one of them down, I'm gonna. They're gonna destroy them. They'll be ruined, their lives will be ruined. It's better for me to take you and not ruin the lives of any of those poor. When, when he told them he was taking you, it was like a scene from Gracelands. There was just like, they were weeping, they were crying like it was horrible. Hundreds of them. And I got upset. He just had to say, look, just chill out, didn't you? I did. I just said, you know, you're all Mahoes. But I can't choose between you. So I'm taking Carl. So I'm taking Carl. You know, he gets. He could get you a discount. Frocks. Now, I had a letter from the people that. There's a. Listen. Car. There's an organization that sponsors the BAFTA Awards in terms of clothes and fashion. They sent me a letter. They said, your partner. They've not specified the sex. They've said your partner can come along and choose an outfit. Now, I suspect by the look of it, it is a woman's outfitters. I'm thinking we could get you a lovely trouser suit. It may look feminine, right. But I think people will be fooled. It'd just be a little bit roomy in the hip and probably narrow on the shoulders. But you're a bit skinny. Why don't you take it? Because it's a lot of an insult. And maybe just some pearls as well. Be lovely, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you? I haven't got anything sorted to wear yet. See, you're slagging me off. You're likely to end up going in a tracksuit. Yeah, I'm going out today. I've never bought a suit since I was like, 11. Right. I went to my brother's wedding. That's the last time I wore a suit. Really? And you can't get anywhere near it now, can you? Can't get into that. No. No. That was a good day. What was it? What sort of suit was it? It was like a sort of a gray, silver one. Excellent. Quite flary. Well, try and go for some silver one. Just think that with your little round head. What did you. What did that look like? That looks all right. Like he'd landed from the walking. I didn't really need to wear a suit either, because I didn't. I hardly went into the church. Was in the car park. Right. And it's when my brother was in the army and he had a Ford Capri with one of them horns that goes. And you just sat there. Why didn't he come in his tank? I just. I just sat in that. Doing that all day. And the vicar was getting well annoyed with me. What, when the service was on? Yeah. It was driving everyone. Were you just allowed to do what you wanted when you were growing up? Like Nelson Muntz from the Simpsons? You just. Were you just allowed? Didn't matter. Was there any discipline? You didn't have teachers. You didn't. Did Noah just. Why didn't someone come out and I. Did I got a couple of good hidings off my dad a couple of times. What for? Just being mopey most of the time. If I had a strop on, he'd ate that. He could go out and burn some of it down or nick something, but don't wander around with your head down. Didn't he smack you for not liking a castle once? Yeah. What's that? Look at that. Went to Carnarvon the other day and I was bored. I was at that age when I just wanted to go in an arcade and my dad was saying, come and see the castle. You know, there's history here. And I still don't like castles. It's one of them things that again, just too far back to sort of even think about people living in them. Do you know what I mean? So I was just like, look, it's a wreck, you know, knock it down, flatten the thing. Sure. And I was being really dopey. Isn't that great? It's weird because now, like, my mum and dad have retired and gone to Wales. Yeah. And now and again he texts me there and every time we get to the point where he gave me a clout, he goes, you getting flashbacks, son? Yeah, well, sobering lesson for you. Yeah. You're not on the British Heritage Committee anymore, are you? This is the National Trust land Tarmacket, the biggest car park in Britain, for Christ's sake. So look, you're looking forward to the awards, are you, tomorrow? You better say yes because otherwise. No, it'll be, it'll be all right. I mean, I've told a couple of people and they got like, God, you're dead lucky. Yeah, in a way. Oh, they did lucky. It's like Santa's coming in it. Other way people talk to Carl. You're a lucky boy. Aren't you going to the baftas with Steve? It's just a posh raffle at the end of the day though, isn't it? Do you know what I mean? In a sense it's, you know, they. Give away some tights. Exactly, yeah. It's Chris Tower. It goes. I found. I went to my parents house, I found these just lying around, but winners and losers and. Yeah, but what food? Well, quite. Yeah, but what is exciting, surely, is the Rasmataz and the brushing shoulders with the rich and famous. I'm not into that. You're not? No. I don't feel you're going to appreciate this like we thought. It's weird because Suzanne said to me this morning, who would, you know who Would you like to meet there? Is he anyone who, like, you know, you can get close to and it's like, God, you know, I really admire your, you know, big fan of yours. Whatever. And this. Me and Steve. So you're here now. You know, I really admire your big fanny. I didn't. What did you say? You know, if you're a big fan of it. All right, all right. And sorry, there isn't anyone really. Do you know what I mean? You know, you two are all right. Thanks. Jonathan Ross. Is he going? He might do. I don't know. Hang on, wait a minute. I can't help but feel we could have exploited this more. We could have maybe run a competition to let someone win. You know, if you're not going to appreciate it. Kyle. Yeah. Are you going to get a trouser suit? Are you going to get a lady's trouser suit? I just think then if you go sort of like looking macho and walking down with him, you know, they know that you're not really partners. And I just think it's a slap in the face for bafta. That's true enough. No, it doesn't matter what you wear, though. Can't you mince a little bit? Can't you at least sort of walk a little bit minty because you've got such a macho sort of mank walk. Elton John's fellow doesn't look gay and stuff. He wears and that, does he? Do you know what I mean? It means nothing. No, but that's because Elton's doing the work for him by dressing as like some kind of restoration dame. Yeah. I love the fact he dressed as Anne Widdicombe for special occasions and has his hair done like. That's great. Anyway. Yeah, this is a very underrated album. It's Richard Ashcroft's Alone With Everybody and I know it got a bit of a slag and it didn't sell as well as. Because people were going, oh, it's no urban Hymns. And it. And it. Maybe it's not, but he got criticized for being pop. But this is a great tune on here. You're My Mind In My Sleep and I, I, I think it's, it's really good. It's quite fair. And you. On My Mind In My Sleep Is that one, Carl? It's all right. Yeah, good. Okay. Oh, oh. What I did want to do is I want to play some adverts now. There goes The Fear on XFM 104.9. Well into the last hour and only two more shows. That's true enough. And we're away for three months. Oh, I'm Ricky Gervais, obviously. Yeah. Steve Merchant. Little Carl. Now, Carl, his homework was to come up with those stupid lateral thinking problems. We might. We maybe should give an example of the. Oh, Romeo and Juliet. Right? Romeo's asleep on the bed, Juliet's on the floor covered in water and broken glass. What happened? And you ask all these stupid questions and it's Romeo's account and Juliet's a goldfish. Oh, what am I thinking? Yeah. Yeah. Come on in, Carl. Right, first one. Yeah. There's a bloke lying on the floor, right. He's cut his head, blood's coming out of his head and all his mates come running up and they're all stood round him. Yeah. And they don't take their hats off to. As a mark of respect. That is outrageous. Why didn't they take their ass off? But it's probably as good as. Absolutely. No, but these are really good. Did you make them all up? Yeah. No, I mean, did you make up all the ones that already exist? No, no, no. That would make a lot of sense. Right. A bloke's fallen with his. Yeah. He's lying on the floor. Yeah. He's dead. Yeah. His mates come around. Was it important that his head was cut? I don't know. It would have been okay if he'd have been wearing a hat. He wouldn't have been dead if he was wearing a hat. What's your answer? No, you're meant to answer questions. You don't just go, what's your answer? You say, where's the person? You go, no, and I have to guess, it's obviously like sort of motorbike cycle stunt team or a parachute team. Why didn't they take their hats off? Because they're probably still on the motorbikes or summer or. Yeah, but if you mark. Mark a respect to someone, you could take your helmet off. Getting angry. What? They're parachutists. Why couldn't they take their helmets off? Because they're still coming down for the skill. But he's on the floor dead. Yeah. They can look down and see him on the floor. Are they on the floor, Carl? They're on the floor as well. They're walking. Are they? Yeah. Well, they sort of stood there looking at him. They're stood there, they're stood on the floor looking. They're soldiers. Why? But why if they. Because it might be in a battle zone. They might have their helmets on and he's been shot in the head. Well, that does work. You see, this is my point. That one works. That one works. Unless you've given some piece of information where that doesn't work. What's the difference? Why is yours different to he's been shot in the head in the trenches and they're looking at him and they keep their helmets on? I just don't. Don't think it matters as much if they're in the trench. They're already guarded a little bit, so they could take their hats off. It's the best mate, for God's sake. Okay, he's dwelling on this. Are they normal hats? No, don't get ratty. What kind of hats are they? Baseball hat. If I told you what sort of hats they are, you'd have the answer. Wow. Okay, I've got a guess what sort of a hat it is then, have I? Right. Is it a trilby? No. Is it a. I know what it is. What? They're spacemen. No. Oh, that's a good one. That one works as well. This is my point. I like that one a lot. It works. He's fallen on the moon and there are not. The moon happened. It was set up. We know that. Yeah. Okay, Carl, what's your answer? Builders on a building site. Why is that different to soldiers? Because bricks don't fall in wars, but bullets fly. All right, next one. No, let's play a record and we'll come back to it. Carl, while you think about what you've done. Oh, yeah, you've embarrassed. Let's play some classic suede. Yeah. And this is for David and Kieran, I think, who wanted a bit of. A bit of butler at his best. Come on, crack it on. I hate you. But coming next, you're next. Lateral problem number two. Brilliant. Suede there. Indeed. I think their second or third single. Brilliant. All the way back ten years ago. Absolutely. You know what I mean? Metal Mickey on XFM 104.9. 10 years ago must have, I think was drowners. 91. I think so, yeah. Go on, go on. And Carl, stuff on them. This is a bit easier, but I still think it's a good one. So this is. We should explain what this is. If you just tuned in. It's one of those stupid lateral thinking. Problems that Carl himself has created. Yeah, that was his homework. Right, this one, it's a fella, he. He has a normal day doing. Doing stuff. Nothing wrong with him. Right. And it's the twist in the tower. It's just like towers. The unexpected Just a normal day. Nothing wrong with him. Hold on, though. He's got the legs of a fish. Go on. So that's why he's been hiding his legs. He does his. The legs of a fish. So he can't carry on. He has his what? His working day and that. And then he gets a bit tired, goes to bed, he puts the light on, leaves it on, goes to bed. Oh, that's crazy. That's mental. I can't think what's happened. Anyway, here's Radiohead, right? Okay. What the question is, why does he put the light on? So a man, he's had a normal day. He's coming from work. Is that right? He's coming from work or he's not been working? No, he's been working and stuff, I think. You think You've made it up, Carl. You can decide. So the question is, why has he put the light on when he's asleep? There's a reason that he's put the light on when he's asleep. Has he gone to sleep? No, Carl, don't shrug. You're meant to answer these questions. He put the light on before he went to bed. Yeah. And the question you're asking me is why? What's the scenario? And the lights on and. Yeah, but he's gone to sleep. Yeah, he started reading and then he fell asleep. No. Did he intend. So he intentionally, for some reason, put the light on every night. It's mad. Sounds mad. That's cold, isn't it? Every night he does it. Yeah, he puts the light on. Carl, is the point of this. He puts the light on for a very good reason. Not for us, but for some people. He's blind and it's always been on and he thinks he's turning it off, but it was on in the day and he thinks he's turning it off, but he's turning it on because he's blind. That'd be stupid. That works. No, that works great, Rick. Yeah, thank you, Carl. So you've got to come up with. Hang on. It's blind. Why would you put a light on? No, he thinks he's off. Yeah, but why would he turn it on anyway? To think. So he doesn't get burgled, so people know he's in because he can't see him. So he just, like. He puts the light on when he's there, then he turns the light off when he goes to bed. So people think it's fine, but he's got it out of kilter and actually he's. He's walking around in the dark all day. I don't believe that. If you're blind, you turn your life. I don't think you'd be living on your own, would you? I'm not having that for a second. Blind people live on their own. Well, some people do. Lonely blind people live on their own. No, if you, if you like, if you've got bad eyes and even women. Any, I mean there. Any blind women who are living on the road. No, I mean if you know of some blind women. 700, 800. 1, 2, 3, 4. We've gone through this. If you are a blind woman with. With, with no standards and you don't care annoying voices and smell. Yeah. Then get in touch with you. Yeah. I mean, you've got to be within the ages of say, 25 to 65, you know. Well, call it 75. If you were blind, would you live in London? Because someone said yesterday there was one struggling outside in Leicester Square and I don't understand if you would. I mean, you know, it might have been a tourist. But why come to London if you, if you're blind. It's the worst place in the world to come if you're blind. Hear the sights. To hear the sights. It's a bit mad, isn't it? Well, they have, they do the same job. They have tourist needs like anyone else. Yeah. No, but it sort of stinks and you'd go away going, oh, it's not that good. I just thought, I thought it was a bit weird. Never mind your concern for the partially sighted or sight impaired people coming to London. Get on with this. Yeah, so. Yeah. So there he is. Yeah. It's like. Oh, a bit tired. Yeah. Just put the light on to bed. Yeah. So he turns the light on and he goes to bed. Yeah. Oh, should we, should we, should we play a track? It's not. It is not. He's not sleeping on the job. He's a lighthouse keeper. Well done. Is he a lighthouse? That's not it, Kyle. He's a lighthouse keeper. Right. Why wasn't the light on all the time? It's light in the day, you idiot. Play a record. What? Play a record. You're a buffoon. No, actually, the light isn't on in the day, is it? No, it's not. I think you're the buffoon. Yeah. Carl has won. Hey. Dead on my head on my own sleep. Rescue me 100 reasons and silver on XFM 104.9. I love the fact that car went a little bit mental then. So Happy that he thinks that a lighthouse keeper popped the light on at the same time every. Are you telling me it was never foggy? Everyone has a routine in the job. And why was he going home from work knackered? What had he been doing all day? He never said he went home knackered. He did. He said he went home. He's just on a day's work. He said he went home knackered and puts the light on and goes to sleep. That's what he said. Yeah, but he's maybe a part time lighthouse. Oh, what does he do? Works in the library. Does he as well? Now listen, Rick, don't. Let's just. I'm really with Carl here. He definitely got you, he said right and properly. Anyway, I got it right. But then you embarrass yourself by saying. Stupid, but you stupid. You would never put a nightmare light on during the day. What's your. What's your next one? I've been painting it that day. Oh, I think it's extra shattered. Right, okay, the next one. Last one. This. Yeah. Lateral thinking, natural thing. And you've. You've written this yourself, You've had no help from anyone? No, I've come up with these on my own. Okay. Right, last one. This bloke. Yeah, this bloke. He's got a brother that is never met. Right. They got separated at birth by, you know. Anyway, he gets a letter in the post. Yeah. He says, oh, I tracked you down. Yeah, Meet me at the airport. Yeah, okay. As soon as he gets to the airport, he goes, there he is. And he goes walking over. How did he know that was his brother? He'd never seen him. They were twins. They looked exactly the same. They were on the same day. Now Steve's got it. Yeah, that's what I mean. So he knew they were born the same day. So he knew they were twins. Yeah. I didn't say they were born on the same day, did I? No, no, I'm just reiterating. They would be though if they looked identical. Yeah, sorry about that. When we've got you there, call me. Yeah, you're quite upset about that. That was one out of three, though. What about this then? Do you know that when. Two brothers born on the same day of the same mother and the same father, but they weren't twins. Why say that one again? Two brothers, yeah, are born on the same day of the same mother and father, but they, they weren't twins. Why not? This is good radio. You see that? The problem is I heard you saying To Steve. I'm going to do that one about the shark in the pool. So I'm trying to think, this is. Nothing to do with that one though, is it? Clearly give him the answer. The answer is they were. They were two of triplets. All right. I had another brother. So do you want to do the other one about the shark in the swimming pool? Okay. A bloke just in his swimming trunks walks into a swimming pool full of man eating sharks. He walks around for a bit and slowly gets out the other side. And he's not bitten or anything. Why not? Because they'd already eaten. No, they're starving hungry. He walked through the water. He wasn't like a bridge. No, he actually was in the water soaking wet. The sharks, he. He had like a metal suit on. No, naked. Apart from swimming trunks. There were real sharks. Real sharks. Swimming about money and hungry. Yeah, really hungry. Yeah. This fella gets into the same pool. Yeah, it's the same pool exactly. He walks, right. He gets in the steps, he walks down, he walks across. Yeah. He's in the water. Yeah. Up to his neck. Yeah. And the sharks are near him. Yeah. They're attacking him. They're attacking him. They're actually attacking him. But he still gets out. Okay. Walks out the other side. And he's not. Hasn't got a mark on him. I don't know. Go on, Rick, what's the answer? I was lying about the sharks. There weren't any sharks. He's lying about the sharks. Completely lying. Just made up. Just an empty pool. That's just stupid. That's our point. They're rubbish. Oh dear. Oh. Look at his face. He's so offended. Oh, defended and confused. Come on, play us all. No. Go on then. Good fortune. PJ Harvey on XFM. 104.9 on Ricky Gervais. Obviously. Steve, Carl, I've got a real one for you. This is a logic question, not a stupid one. Just very quickly, 10 black balls in a bag and 10 white balls in a bag. Yeah. How many balls do you have to pull out to ensure you've got a pair of the same color? But what's stopping you putting your hand in and pulling out? Jesus. Four for. Because I asked for the minimum number. So what's. How many do you have to pull out to ensure you've got a pair? That doesn't. Doesn't say. All of them. That'll ensure it. No. What's the minimum number? 11. 11. Because you if. Why'd you need 11? What? Because there's 10 black balls. 10 white balls. Yeah. Yeah. Say if you're. For some reason, you pulled out all the 10 black balls. Yeah. Right. Yeah. You'd have a pair, wouldn't you? You'd have a pair after the first two. Yeah. So what's the minimum number you have to pull out to ensure two? No, because you might pull a white one and a black one. Yeah, but I don't understand what you're saying. Sometimes I get that impression, the way you look at me, like Helen from Big Brother. Yeah, but I've always assumed that. Right. What's the minimum number you have to pull out to ensure you have two of the same color? Three. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. Yeah, you can use that one. Yeah, that's a good one. So what's the minimum. What's the minimum number you have to pull out to ensure you have four of the same color? Oh, God. 8. Was that a guess? I don't know. I understand the first one. We've done it now. Okay. All right, we'll leave it there. That's good. Good. Okay, now, white van coral. This is. Yeah, this is where we. That's too much. If you'd have seen his face and Steve, his. His eyebrows sort of went down while you were doing that, baby. He genuinely looked pained. It's like you're back at school, isn't it? Yeah. It's starting to get hard work now. Okay, we just do white van car. Then. This is. This is your opinions. You can't be wrong on this, can you? There's no right or wrong answer here. Okay. All right, but. So this is where we ask Carl his views on the. The big news stories of the week. Basically, we've. We've stolen an idea from the sun newspaper. And so this isn't cruel, this program, is it? Oh, I think so. Picking on me. It's not, is it? It's weird because a few people have said, oh, you're picking on me. It depends how you look at things. Sure. Yeah. But you do. Do like it. We. I mean, we could look at it like it's a laugh. Yeah. It's not fun for us. You know, we like you. You know, you're our favorite. Yeah, I'm gonna say thing in the world, but I don't mean that, you know, in a derogatory way. I'm cool with it. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Okay. So your views, please, on the fact that attitudes are changing to the possible marriage of Charles and Camilla. Oh, what do you think of that? The raws at the moment, because the recent tragedies are apparently high in the polls and people are coming around to the idea of Charles and Camilla getting hitched. What's your thought? Whatever, really. I mean, if they're happy with it. The thing that comes out of it most is it just goes to show, right, that there is someone for everyone. Just because I mean, no disrespect to Camilla, I'm not a good looking person either, but she isn't a stunner and yet she's gone and picked up a royal. Right. Yeah. So I think it's good for things like that to happen because it cheers you up. Do you know what I mean? Gives you a bit of hope. Thanks, Carl. So, yeah, it's, it's good, you know, if they're happy, if anyone's happy. It's a good story in it. Yeah. I mean, yeah, no, he's had a bit of bad luck and, and now he's got someone else in his life. So I'm just. While he's doing this, I'm just doing a list of questions to ask him what he thinks of things in the world. Is that all right? Yeah, no, no problem. Okay. What do you make of. Well now listen, this may be a non story or it may be the biggest story that's about to break. Ulrika Johnson and Sven Goran Erickson's affair. Are you familiar with this? It's over the papers today. Apparently Ulrike and Zven are going out, although there appears to be no evidence for this. Yeah, I don't even give it time of day. Do you know, well done. Doesn't. Doesn't affect me whatsoever. As long as he does his job well. Yep. And what's she doing at the moment? Presenting dog eat dog, I think. Right. You know, as long as she does. As long as they both do their jobs well. Yeah. At the end of the day that's going on with a lot of people out in the world, isn't it? Do you know what I mean? Just because he's an England boss, as long as, you know, we win the. Win the games and that he's doing his job. If she's, you know, gets a dog winning the prize or whatever. No. Okay. It's not worth it. Carry on. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. So it's a dog winning a prize. I haven't seen dog eat dog. What's that? It's all right. So that's it? Yeah, it doesn't matter. Okay, what about this then? Are you disappointed by the nation that a third of us are apparently unaware of St. George's Day. 23Rd is St. George's Day, the one with the snakes that we've talked about? No, that's. Are you one of that third? Do you think St. George is the. Patriot of England who killed the dragon? Yeah. I mean, there's too many of these days, isn't there? That's the problem. If you make it a bit more special, like Christmas, so you buy presents and that for each other, then people will remember it. But there's so many these days with Easter and Pancake Tuesday and all that. So it's not surprising. I think as time goes on, we'll find that a lot of these days will just disappear because, you know, people are busy. There'll be new ones. Weren't there? I don't know. People that'd be like, Gareth gates day in 50 years time. It's just weird. I mean, I remember being a kid, right, going out on a Sunday and shops would be short because it was like, you know, the day of rest and all that. People don't care. Now it's like, well, we can make some more money. We'll open the shops. Yeah. I mean, is that good or a bad thing? It's good because I remember I used to have to get up early to go and get some bread if we didn't have any in, because the shop would only be open for a couple of hours in the morning. Yeah. Whereas now I'd be able to. Yeah, I remember that. I remember that. Shops and you couldn't get aspirin and stuff. Certain things. Nightmare on a Sunday afternoon. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah. Pubs. Denom. Do you remember space operas? Yeah. Yeah. Shut up. Can I ask you something? Okay. I've got a little list of things. What do you think of, like those pug dogs that are bred and they can hardly breathe evil. Yeah. What do you think of gays? They're all right. I mean, just like straight people. You get bad ones, you get good ones. Exactly. We've learned a lesson today. Absolutely. Let's play a record. Yeah. What do you fancy a bit of Radiohead? Yeah. You don't mind, though, if people think we're gay. For instance, when we go to the BAFTAs tomorrow. That's terrible. I don't want that. Why? Hey. Why? Because I'm not. That'd be a lie. I don't like lying. If I was, I'd say I was gay. Yeah, but I'm not. We'll say you were. Just pretend. We won't get in otherwise no, just a little kiss and a cuddle sound. I'm a bit gay. No, I'm not gay. On XFM 104.9. Wow. Near the end of the show, isn't it? You had a good time, Carl? It's been all right. I knew it wasn't going to be a belter today. Why? What do you mean? What's up with it? Because what happens? The last two weeks have been quite good and we always tend to have two good ones and then one that's just all right. We'll let the listening public be the judge of that. Well, yeah. And the Sony committee. Yeah. What do you want to do a clip show of the best? We should do that for our last show. People should vote for their favorite hilarious link. Yeah. And then we can put it together on a tape. Right. Is there a recommender that wants to release the. The bit like I love, including such favorites as. Do you like gays? And this lad. He had a horse. Yeah. Oh, I scored once. I was stung by B and who could forget? It's lovely. She do that. Can you. Have you kept all these on tape? Yeah. So can you do a compilation? People phone in. No, this. The next two weeks, phone in for your favorite clip. How can they get hold of your car? In the week. What's my name? With xfm.co.uk so Carl Pilkington. Carl.Pilkington. Carl. Carl with a K. Yeah. Carl.pilkington@xfm.co.uk Vote your favorite link of the last three months. We should make a little compilation and sell it. And we get like, Radiohead, they love. They'd love to be on the compilation with us, wouldn't they? Wouldn't they? Oh, well, anyway, yeah. Right. You know, like, you're always giving me questions in the week. You're always saying things like, if I put you in this situation, what would you do? Like what? Like what? Bizarre things like what, though? Say one. If you had to lick Barbara Cartland's face, would it be the right cheek or the left cheek? Sorry, Does Barbara want her face being licked? No, I'm just saying if she. If that's what she's into, then I don't mind popping. She should. Yeah. So. Isn't she? I don't think she's. Just be careful because you can't lie with the dead. So I'll make sure she's dead before we start saying horrendous things. I don't know. I don't think she is dead. I'm almost certain she's not. I don't think so. No, she's not. Is Barbara Carlton dead? 087-008-001234 I'll have to get Chris in. So listen, right? So. So anyway, he always calls up with, like, bizarre, bizarre stuff like that. And I was watching a program the other night about snakes, right? And it was like, don't walk through a river that's full of snakes. Because good, good advice. They. If you got a kid in the car or in the house, turn your radio down if. If you don't want them to hear stuff like this. But, yeah, they go for your. For your tackle. Why? I don't know. They just do. They think it's another little snake, maybe with swollen cheeks. Yeah. Or an anaconda, in my case, with one eye. Somebody joking. So, yeah, and I. I said to Ricky, what would you do, right? It's very scaly, you two in the woods. You're having a wandi. Steve having a wonder. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You walk through the river. What, me and Y. Okay, because you're tall, so it's like you can check out how deep it is before Ricky goes through, right? You do do that sometimes, don't you? Yeah, but a snake bites your tackle. Yeah. Yeah. And say penis. Yeah, it's the correct word for it. It's not offensive. It doesn't sound nice. Say it. Say. Say it. Penis. But I don't. Oh, you dirty little. You dirty little slut. Carl. You're a dirty little. It's just one of those words. Right, carry on with the. Let's carry on. What's the story? I'm wandering through a river. Yeah. And the snake bites your penis. You know. You know, Ricky, like, doesn't leave, like, WC1. Why on earth we're gonna be anywhere near a river where there's sort of. Well, anyway, anyway, yeah, you are in this situation. Yeah. The snake bites you. And I said to Ricky, if it was a matter of life or death, would you suck out the poison? What do you think he said? And the bit I made because he was thinking about it, you know, like, oh, God. Well, he's, you know, he's my best mate and everything. What will I do? And I said. And then Steve starts sort of groaning like he's enjoying it. I'm just trying to remember what I did do. What did happen in that instance? Okay, so. So I've been bitten. I've been bit on the penis by a snake. Yeah. There's poison in. There's no poison in it. Yeah. I've had a go at trying to suck it out myself. Yeah, yeah. But you've never mastered that. Yeah, yeah.
