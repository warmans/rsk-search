Right. Well, just in case anyone's new doesn't normally listen, basically I'm Educating Ricky. Do a bit of research in the week. Find stuff, news, history, anything that's interesting. Three stories are given a nice little headline. You take your pick. Between now and three, you're gonna learn three things. Yeah, yeah. So the headlines are. I'll be no buying one of them. Give us that again. I'll be no buying one of them. Nice. Okay. Yeah. We've also got hippopotter news. Okay. And chicken. You believe it? Chicken. You believe it? Well, I'm gonna go for hippopotamus. Right, well, this one, it's. I'm not going to take the credit here. I heard Christian talking about this on breakfast. Right. Because it's a good, good, good story that happened, basically. I don't know if I told you about it last week when we're having our spaghetti, but I think you did. I know what it is. I know what this is. Okay. I've not heard this. Right. There's a little. All right, there's a circus going on somewhere. I think it was in America. Is that present day or old times? I'm talking like in the last three weeks. Okay. Right. Little midget circus really packed out show people are loving it. Steve, you're asked the same question I did. I know. So. So there's little. Little midget jumping up and down on a tramp. That's what circles is doing. I take good money to see it. So everyone's clapping and he's getting carried away. Cause he can't believe he's laughing. He can't believe they're loving it. I didn't know they'd like a little person on a trampoline, but they love me. But you know what it's like when if there's a crowd of people sort of encouraging you to sort of go higher and stuff. And I'm sure he knew he was getting out of hand, but he was jumping and he was coming down the road going higher and he's going really high in the air, right. So he's doing this. Crowd are clapping. There's a hippo, right. Just sat next to the trampoline getting ready to come on and do his act. Oh, right. I thought he was in the audience. Getting ready to do his act, Steve. So he's a Ventriloquist. What do you mean? He's sitting by the trampoline waiting to do his act? Because. It's why they sit in the dressing room and they go, five minutes, Mr. Muss. Five minutes, Mr. Muss. So anyway, so the hippo's there. He's getting annoyed. Is he? Because this. Because the midget. How can I follow this? Sometimes this is really annoying. They're gonna be. Oh, no. So he's thinking, he's already done the trampoline. My pogo sticker. He's never gonna work. Yeah, go on. So there's. If they wait, this. See, it's a great story, and I just know he embellishes it. Or it gets slightly wrong. Go on. So. So there's a midget jumping up and down. The hippo's getting annoyed. The crowd are going mad. The midget's loving it. Can't believe his luck. Although we think you think he probably knows he's dicing with danger. So next thing you know, they're all saying, hi. Hi. It gives it heavy sort of landing on the trampoline, goes really high, but goes off at a funny angle. Oh, hypotenuse, okay. Yeah. And sort of flies up. Hypotenuse. Sure. Flies off at a funny angle. Hippos there, swallows him Whole crowd are clapping, thinking that's why the hippo was waiting there. Rubbish. Rubbish. It's not rubbish, though. No. Maybe there was an accident in a. A circus with a midget and a hippo. But at no point was this hippo waiting to go on, going, come on. The midget flew off at hypotenuse and landed in the hippo's mouth and was swallowed whole. This is. This is what? You embellish it. That is great. I have to say, though, Rick, when I heard midget, trampoline, hippopotamus, I was thinking, actually waiting to happen. Yeah. So, yeah, maybe. I mean, is it that you should never put those three together. Never. It's a recipe for disaster. Everyone knows that. Midget, trampoline, hippopotamus. Are you mental? You're asking for trouble. Well, you know, when he told me it, he said, and the midget. He didn't mention the hippopotamus. And he said, the midget went on and soon he fell off and the hippo ate him. And I said, sorry, what was the hippo doing there? He went, it's a circus. I've never heard of a circus having a hippo. No. What do hippos do? What can they do? You can't train them. Can. Aren't they, like, very deadly? They're huge, aren't they? You can't out here f. In a circus. You're not thinking of Zippo. He's neither. Clown. Yeah. No, you know, and it wasn't. It wasn't. It wasn't some sort where Zippo was eating a. And it's. It's some sort of horrible sexual act. No, it was definitely. I heard it on breakfast. Right. Oh, okay. Sorry. No, it's definitely true. Okay, good. Well, let's play a record then. 4.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Stephen Merchant. It's the best of. You've been voting in all week, sending your emails. So here's the clips that you wanted. Me and Carl went out, right? And with me and Jane, Carl, Johnny and Gigi, wasn't it, Gigi, Is it important to win? No. Okay. We're walking down the street. Carl was there, though, and he can back me up on this. We had a curry, we're walking back and this little funny homeless fella, didn't he? Yeah. Oh, I gotta tell it before I go, didn't he? Yes. He came up to me, right, and he recognized it and he came up to me and he went. He went, oh, he said, I've just nicked my DVDs from HMB. And he shook my hand, he was so happy with it. And I went, right, excellent. He went, all I do is I just swing the bag over the top like that when I'm going out. And he had a bag full of DVDs, didn't he? And he was. He was so pleased to tell me that he'd stolen that. Great. He said, they're going like hot cakes. He said they're going. Of course they are. I know. We get paid for them though, don't we? So he. Not the stolen ones, don't we? No. What do you mean? Did you sign them for him, you idiot. What, so he just nicked five? Yeah. You say he was homeless, Was he? Well, I. I don't know. Maybe. No, surely. How would he have seen the show? He just walked past Curry's one one morning. Yeah. Seen a trainer for it, thought. Interesting. I don't know if he was homeless. I did. I didn't go into his home life. He shook his hand, though, and. But he's. He made Carl look smart, do you know what I mean? So how does he sell them? Where does he sell them? Does he go to. People go, do you want an office dvd? They're not nicked. Yeah. Four quid. Yeah, exactly. At least stolen. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, they've still got the tags on them. Well, it's like those people who. You. Those cab drivers that you meet, it's at three in the morning. Who've just got a car. Yeah. Just went out with a car. Yeah. And I'll pick people up and charge them. Yeah. I got in one once. I said to him, a guy just pulled up. I said. He said, I was in, like, East London. I go back to North London. I said, yeah, going to Swiss Cottage. He went, sure, hop in. We set off. He went, do you know the way? I said, well, not really, no. I thought. I thought you'd know the way. You're in a cabin. He went, no, don't really know the way, though. I said, have you got an A to Z? He went, no. I thought, well, if you're going to go out just on the. You know, just winging it as a cab driver, two things. Take a map and a torch. He didn't have either. He said, well, I'll probably get to Camden. I said, well, I'll direct you from there. Drove on for about five minutes, making conversation. About five minutes later, he went, do you know the way to Camden? I thought you knew the way to Camden. I don't really know the way. I thought, oh, let me out. Four quid. Exactly. And that's. I can't. I don't know who's got that sort of time on their hands that they just think, it's three in the morning, I'm at a loose end. I think I'll go out doing a bit of cabbing. Wow. Because your dad was a cabby, wasn't it? Yeah, he was, yeah. Couldn't stand it. But it's good money. He was a professor. He wasn't like a Chancellor. What was he. What was he doing when he put that little forest gump in a. In a weedy bin? That was. That was part of the cab company thing. They had to do like a charity event once a year and he did it one year. Never asked him again. Tell the story again. No, I'd rather not, because. Why? Because we got a few sort of complaints about it. Why? Why do you get complaints about it? Because it's. Because you put a kid in a bin and it's not the thing to do. But we could use it as a sort of sobering lesson for people. Yeah. Tell it like it. Tell it like a. You know, don't. You shouldn't do it. Nice. Yeah. But that's how I did it last time. But people still didn't like it. All the stuff I tell you, I don't. You know, we don't take the mickey out of people on purpose. It's real life, innit? And that goes on in life. Yeah. I was staying that in hospital, though. Do you know I was in hospital? Yeah. You know, he did some jokes about old people and that, and he said, at the end of the day, if something makes you laugh, it's funny. So what you meant to do. And laughing's good for you. Yeah. So that isn't as good for you, is it? No, but there's probably more people laughing at one person. So if you balance it out, there's only one person who's upset and there's a bunch of people laughing. So it's. Give me an example of that. Give me an example, for instance, Carl. Pilkington, as he talks and the people listening. Yeah, yeah. Now give me the example of like, so, you know. Okay, well, I can't because, again, that's what I'm saying. I can't tell you the story because there might be someone out there who this person might even be listening and think I forgot about that. And you brought it all back to me. Yeah. So I prefer to leave it, but I think people know. Why did he put him in the bin in the first place? Because he was getting out of hand. What was he doing, though? You see, I can't explain. He can. Don't be silly. I prefer to. To leave it, honestly. What was he doing? Was he annoying him? He was annoying me dad and the other people in the cab. Right. And he thought, how can I deal with this before it gets too out of hand? Yeah. He pulled over and put the lad in a wheelie bin. I'm gonna be. So we'll leave. Xfm 104.9. Ricky and I are on holiday. Obviously, it's Christmas time, but Carl is here in the studio. He's pressing buttons. All right, Carl? All right. What do you make of the first genetically modified baby? Oh, are you worried about this? Do you know? What did they do? What. Let me see what it says here. Well, isn't it just choosing. Choosing the, you know, eye color? Well, this is. This is the. This is the concern, isn't it, that in the future you'll be able to decide whether it's a boy or a girl. What? How intelligent it is, what it looks like, Is it handsome? Is it ugly? Obviously, no one will choose an ugly baby. And so on and so on and so on. And so it means that, you know, where will it lead? Where will it end? Carl, are you concerned? I've thought about this a lot. What will us three look like in the future if they're being, you know, genetically modified, beautiful people? What will be we be like? How will we be considered in society? But we've talked about this before, aren't we, about the cloning thing? Yeah, that's a bit weird. But I don't think it matters because at the end of the day, right, you might look like some other kid, but it's the way you've brought that you brought up that will change your features and the way you are, you know, your personality. If you lie, you get a long nose, don't you? Well, no, but listen, right, because I remember when. When we, you know, I was growing up on this estate. This is gonna be good. No, no, it's not. It's just an example of how this doesn't work, so we don't need to worry sort of thing. Sure. Okay. So growing up on this estate and there was a. There's this woman about four houses down, right. It's a bit rough. All right, didn't fancy. Oh, God, no. Right. But shadowy. Well, tell me about her first. I'm interested in this woman. Why was she. It was a very. Man. I didn't grow up in a posh house or anything. I'm not saying that if you live in a bit of a rough house, you're a bad person. What does she look like? But anyone can tattoos clean up. Like Tony Green with a fag on. They didn't clean up much. Right. Oh. Which even if you've not got a lot of money, you can still try and make it look nice. Yeah. Right. But she didn't. And a kid used to take a horse into the house. Sorry. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah, Whoa, Neddy. Whoa, Neddy. What do you mean? A kid used to take a horse into the house? When they get a horse, must have. Nicked it from somewhere. You seen horse? What, is that from outside the saloon around the corner? Yeah. Was it just tied up with a bit of lettuce? Oh, that's great. Big Jake. I'm looking for it. I denounced. Sorry, let me get this. This was before the lynching stopped or. Where did he get a horse from? What do you mean? He must have nicked it. His mum said. Where'd you get that from? I bought it. All right, then we'll keep it out the kitchen. I don't want you going Catlin rustling. Where did he get a horse from? Carl. And how long did he have it for? Was he leading it or riding it? Mum. Open the door. I can't stop. I can't stop it. Open the patio door as well. Looks like we got us a runaway. What do you mean? I don't know. But the thing is they couldn't afford to buy one because they're not cheap. So. I'm just guessing. Maybe that's wrong of me. But I think he had a horse. Yeah. Right. So that's why the family didn't have any money. They'd spend it on the horse. That's what I'm saying. I don't think they would have bought it. So anyway. To whisper. Carl. In case they're listening. Yeah. They could be in the room next door buying it. Is keeping it as well. So I was like in the car with my dad coming into the avenue. And you used to have to drive down it to turn around and, you know. Sort of go back to our house. You had the traditional method of transport. Yeah. The horse was in the lounge reading a paper. Just. Just like walking around. God. And when I. When I was doing. I tried to earn myself some money once by flogging little flowers in. In plastic cups. What? This is genius. It just keeps coming. What do you mean? You're trying to flog little flowers? What do you mean? Wait. Let's play a record. Let's play a record and come back to this. Wait a minute. It's always gonna just unravel and unravel. It's gonna go for hours. Let's play a tracker. It's not an onion. Isn't it? We've created a whole world here where there's a man living with a horse. Just walking around the lounge. I come from the West Country. I've never heard anything like that. I just think of a big sort of like orange carpet and a rediffusion telly and this horse going. I'm fed up in it. Exactly. This is really. I'm not taking the rubbish out again. Yeah. Right. Play a record. Let's have Velvet Underground. We got that lined up. Yeah. The classic from the first album. I'm Waiting for the Man. Let's come back to the hors. Little flowers in pots. What do you mean? From that classic first album. Velvet Underground and Nico. Which apparently peaked at a disappointing 171 in the US charts. Think of that. And that's obviously Louis Devel underground and Waiting for the Man. Yeah. Great track. So we Were talking. We were doing White Van man, and we got onto genetically modified babies. And Paul started telling a story about someone with a horn horse. And then he got onto. He was trying to make money selling flowers. Just do the flowers. Well, hang on, I just want to recap slightly. So there was a family and who had the horse in the family? It was because you lived on an estate in Manchester. So the mother. The mother was a right pig, apparently. I don't know. That's right. You don't need to go that far. But you. What I'm trying to do is like, make a picture for you so you understand what a picture. Who did she look like? Bit of a. And no disrespect to her. Bit like Pauline Quirk. Quirky. Yeah. Okay. I knew you were gonna say that. I knew it was gonna be important. Did you have any tats? I never got that close to it. Okay. All right. So. And so who had the horse? Was this her son or her daughter? Her daughter had stolen a horse. Yeah. From. I don't know where. There was a. I think it was some stables down the road or something. And they. They kept the horse in the house with. They kept it in the house. Did they have it for long? No. So. And you said you were in the house one day and you saw the horse? Yeah. What happened was I was. They did this thing at school about raising money for charity. Right. For some local charity. And they said, you can do anything to raise money. And they came out with all these ideas, and I thought, that's good. What was the charity? Well, I don't know. I thought, forget the charity. Yeah. That's just a good money making. You're a charity. So I asked me ma'am for some because she used to have a lot of flowers around the house. I said, can I just take some snippings off them and I'll go and buy some plastic cups and got some soil out the garden. Planted the. The bits of plants in them. Yeah. Got a tray, had about 25 plants on it. Selling them for 25 pence each. Excellent. To sell any. Yeah. So loads. Did you just cut. You didn't just cut them and stick them in there? Yeah, survived. Oh. But I think people sort of thought, well, good on him for trying. But anyway, so I went round to theirs because I thought their house could do with a bit of color and stuff. Yeah, this is a bit rough. So as I went, the horse went. Thank God for that breakfast. They've been feeding me kitty cat. So I got up to the door. And they opened the door and it was one of them houses where no carpet. Yeah. A horse in the living room. You know, we've all been there. And the horse was walking around the living room. I look quite happy and everything because I always say that about Black Beauty was on. Yeah. Well, think about it, right? If you were a horse, where would you rather be? In a little wooden hut with a load of hay or in like a house with a central heating, three piece suite and an Atarion that telly and that. No, but I was saying this the other day. And an Atari. Right. I was walking through London. 64. Rubbish. Exactly. Walking through London with Suzanne. Right. And you know, like homeless people always have dogs. And she said, oh, I hope, I hope she looks after it. I said, they've got. That dog is happier than most dogs. Right. Because people always walk past and give it a pat on the head. It's with its owner all the time. Yeah. It's out in the open. It's not locked up in a house. Yeah. It doesn't eat. But other than that, does eat, though. They're always all right. So that's what I was saying. I think this horse was, was doing all right for himself. Well, not many horses have got their own house. Yeah. But anyway, that's, that's, that's by the bar. Yeah. So anyway, this family who's a bit. What we were talking about, it was. About clothing, modified kids and all that stuff. Yeah. Right. Now what I'm saying is you could say, you know, right, Steve, you could have a baby, right. And Ricky could see it and say, God, I want one that looks like that. Yeah. Right. It could happen, Rick. So come on, work with him. So you take it to the doctors and I don't know what they do, they inject it with something or whatever. Yep. That's how it's done. Yeah. And get a little baby and there it is. It looks the same. Now the thing is you separate, you both go off and do your own things. Yep. Right. Now you look at Stephen. This is. You look after your baby. Yeah. You treat it well, you give it good food and have a good day. All the vitamins and stuff. Yeah. Ricky just gives it cheese. Right. So then it changes its looks, it goes a bit fat, you know, it gets tired easily and that sort of thing. Now when this family. Why am I just feeding a baby cheese? Right. This, this, this, this, this family who had a horse in the, in, you know, in their house. Yeah. They had a, a little baby. I mean, Mum went Round and said, you're not going to believe this, but it's a beautiful looking baby. Right? Yeah. And I was like, well, you know, and the weird thing is it was a good looking kid but as time went on they didn't really look after it and I'm not saying like abusing it, but it used to run around, it used to play out to like 10 at night. Yeah. It used to chase cars. Right. It was a bit. Did it have hooves? Yeah, no, chase cars, right. What sort of chases cars? Oh, God. Was it called Rover? Did it catch sticks? Leon? It was cold. Right, right. Now the weird thing is it was a good looking kid but as time went on and all that, like not eating properly and its hair was all patchy. It's not Liam Gallagher, is it? And chasing cars on that and it became an ugly kid. It's definitely Liam Gallagher. That's what I'm saying. Right. You can clone all you like, but at the end of the day it's what you brought up. Wow, that was a hell of a point. Oh, God. But am I right? You're always right. Carl Gervais, with me. Steve and Carl. Carl, why have you got headache? You got headache? Just a bit stressful because the moves. Moves on this, this week. Are you giving age? Oh, by the way, the XFM listeners came around to me house and bought the food on a table. Did they? Quite normal. They were well happy. Yeah. Couldn't believe the luck with it being quite normal. What do you mean quite normal? Well, it sounds a bit scared in it, getting. Getting people around. I imagine they were scared. And were they excited to see you? Could they. I mean, you know, could you tell that they were pretty pleased to see you? No, I don't think so. I mean, you're Carl Pilkington. Yeah, but I. The fellas sort of. I mean, they brought the whole family around, which was a bit odd. Well, it's not often they get the chance to visit a living creek. Anyway, anyway, they were nice. And you're moving now. He said. He phoned me up today, you know, it was absolutely tipping it down. He had to cycle in, right, because he said because the movie doesn't want to leave his bike around there. And he said, he said. And Suzanne. Oh, I can't say this in case he's listening, can I? He won't know. Suzanne's hired the oldest removal man in London. You should hear him. And the thing is, right, we booked him because everyone else happened to be booked out, but this fella's free, right? So he called up this morning. I've never spoke to him, but he was on the phone. He sounded about 90. Yeah. Carl thinks that he's gonna have to do all the work. And the thing is. Well, it seems he only wanted some Werther originals. Yeah, listen, he seemed to be cheap because it's 50 pound an hour. But. How long is it gonna take him? Yeah. When's the move on then? Wednesday. He came around today to bring some empty boxes and he was struggling with them. So it actually happens on Wednesday. Oh, God. Anyway, I woke up this morning. Yeah. Feeling fine. It's not a blue song. And I turned my phone on and it was from Carl and it went, forget it, I've made my mind up. And I thought, wow, what is that? And I forget it. I've made my. I went, carl, what is it? He went, oh, no, it's about the text I sent you last night. I went, well, what was it? I just got this text. He went, I was just wondering, as I was thinking last night, he said, supposing you had to have your hands removed. Sure. Right? And the doctor said, well, you can either have them stay like that with stumps or I can sew feet there, what would you have? And I was bleary eyed and I went, the stumps? He went, yeah. I went, all right. He went, yeah. And then what was his follow up text to that? And then I got the text, it was obviously before it, and it went. And it was like quite serious. What, what would you do? Would you have stumps or the feet? Right now the way when I said, he's made his mind up and I went, the stumps. He went, yeah. I think secretly decided on the feet, but was too embarrassed to tell me. There's a little, little bit of what would you do? Because it's it. But why did you think of this? Why did you think of this? Girlfriend is a way, right? Yeah. No, that's not why you start thinking bizarre surgery devices. I'll let you into my little mind, right? Last night I. I had some beans on toast, right? She was away. It's good already. She was away, she had some beans on toast, she went wild. Yeah. Right now I was stood up. I live on like a. On a high street, right? So I'm washing up, I'm looking out the window. First thing that had me attention is I can, I can look into other people's flats, right? Yeah. And it was weird how all these different lives were going on. I was watching them and everybody had the telly. On and was watching Volcano. Right. Which was on last night. Right. And I thought, oh, that's weird. Right. I can see them all watching it. And it was like a little Chinese lad who was dancing around in some underpants. And then there's a little old woman who lives downstairs who was reading a book and she's always reading a book every night. And it's like, I have a better life than her. And then there's a. There's like some sort of bouncer who's always getting ready to go out late at night. Yeah. With all the black on, he looks like a bouncer. So I was watching all this life going on. I thought, did you witness a murder while you were doing this? Yeah, it was like. It was like that sort of sliver film where that bloke had loads of tellies watching. So that was going on in my mind. And then I was washing up and I picked up the plate and I thought, it's amazing, isn't it, the human body, the way you can just sort of, you know, I want to pick that up and you do. Yes. And the way your hands work. Right. You've got five little digits, but it's. It's just the right amount to do what you. Yeah, to do what you've got to do. Right. So. So I'm washing, I'm cleaning the plate. Sorry, Carl, stop. It's just the right amount might be one of the most genius things I've ever had. Said. I would love David Attenborough to phone you up and say, carl, how do I word this about the evolution of the mammalian front limb? Just go. We'll just say it's the right amount. But it is, it is. Get in the way. Yeah. And one less would just make it a little bit more tricky when picking up a bit of a slippery dish. Sure. Or buying Glo. Yeah, a slippery dish. So then I was thinking, oh, imagine like going to the doctors and you're saying, yeah, everything's all right, your heart's good and everything, but your art's good. What, your Larry's or. Yeah, yeah, you're in good form and what have you. It's good news. You know, I had Giano in earlier, he's not looking good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you're. You're all right, but your hands need to come off. That's bad. Like, I get a second opinion initially. Oh, God. But a better good news, I've got a nice pair of feet I can sort you out with. Yeah. And he puts them on and then I Was thinking, right, first of all, washing up, what would that be like, Steve? That'd be tricky. And then the second thing was, it'd probably ruin sort of the shape of your jumper because you have to keep. Putting the feet through there. Yeah. And then I thought, but I could still cycle in. Okay, you could run in. Well, that's the thing. Like, you'd be really fast. That's what I was thinking. I thought I could still cycle because I could balance. And then I thought, but the only thing is, I probably couldn't pull the brakes breaks because of little short things. Yeah, yeah. And then, like, you, I thought, but then again, you're running in half the time. So that's what was going on in last night. Right. That's what I was thinking about. Did you. Did you. How long did this take? Well, how long does it take to wash up? Right. Because I imagine you just being there. For, like, all night, probably 25 minutes. How long did the little Chinese fella dance for in his pants? He's always doing it. Last night he was at it for like, 10 minutes. Just. Yeah. And his girlfriend never sits in the same room as him. She's always sat in the bedroom. She's going, you. You dancing pants again? I go in next door. Well, she was in the bedroom. She's always in the bedroom. Sat on the floor on the mobile phone. Right. All the time. Yeah. It's weird how people's lives are just like. It's like that Groundhog Day thing. It's like, you know, he's jumping about in his underpants. The old woman sat there reading a book. Yeah. And that's what got me thinking about my life. Are you sure she's not dead? Every time you look down there, she's just flicking through it. She's just reading this book. The PA never turn. She never seems to finish it. She never moves from her chair. Are you sure? Are you sure? The Chinese girls are dead around her. I'm going into next door again. That little round. Ed Fell's looking in. He's looking in at me. The bouncer goes, don't worry, love, I'll go and beat him up. But he's always getting ready. That's true. They see you staring at and washing up, going, I could have feet here. And they get scared the old woman's dead. Can you tell us roughly which neighborhood you live in? So. So that we know it's central. Central, is it? Yeah. Yeah. Well, imagine if that little. Was he a Chinese fellow, did you say? Yeah. Imagine if he was Listening now, I'd love him to call in and explain these actions. Well, he might be on some other radio station talking about a lad who's always washing up and looking at his hands in a mysterious way. But do we have this doctor, this doctor that would go, well, all right, Carl, I've got. You could either leave him as stumps or I've got every little pair of feet. Feet? Why? I mean, I told Jane this and Jane went, is that the only choice is he could say, I could have some dead man's hands. Have you got any? If you. Where'd you get the feet from? Where'd you get the feet from? Can I have. Can I have. What would you rather have then? Human feet or monkey paws? Well, I mean, that wasn't an option last night, that. If the doctors said that was an option last night. But don't forget, it's in your head, Carl. This didn't happen. I'm just saying at the time, that's all the doctor had to offer. But, you know, it's your head. You can go anywhere. No, no, it wasn't a real doctor to offer. It's in your head. You can go anywhere. You're not trapped. Yeah, but if you can do anything, then you'd say, we'll sort us out some other hands. Fair point. The fair record. Hello, you're listening to the Best of, basically, Carl Pilkington. Right, you're ready then. So just in case you haven't heard it before, I give you some initials of a band or an artist. We're not doing Rockbusters now. We're. Yeah, I thought, well, we could keep that going then. We got. I love educating Ricky. That's my favorite thing now. Well, what do you want to do, Steve? It's just like it's sort of bigged up the prizes. And so this is only by email. Give the email address out now for people to write it down. Now, Carl. Right, ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk Only entries on email. Yeah. You're gonna get three clues. You've got to get them all, right? And you win all. You win all those prizes, you said. Okay, Carl, go on, then. Right, and just a quick example, one of the first ones we did, it was like ak and the clue was exploding pet. Yeah. And it was Atomic Kitten. Right, so you understand how it works. Now, these are your clues. The first one, that army has got some, well, nice trenches. That army has got some, well, nice trenches. Excellent. And the initials there are DW. Do you write some of the questions for 15 to 1? Go on. So that army has got similar phrasing trenches. Okay. Okay, the second one. What were the initials there, Carl? Dw. Dw yeah. Right. The second one. The top of them curtains are all wrecked, all the materials all worn. He acts it out there. We've got to get him on telly. We have got to get him on telly because his little face and his, his gestures. That's the second one. The initials being hv. Okay, the top of those curtains erect, all the materials all worn out, right? HV and the final one. Here's the final clue. I was in Texas the other week, right? I tripped and landed on my knees in a puddle. Wh for that one. So I was in Texas. I tripped up, landed on my knees in a puddle. So that's wh he's got it. Is it great? It's fantastic. Okay, tell me during the record. Tell me during the record you're playing for these compilation albums. We've got the Fat Boy Slim dvd, Linda Green on VHS and of course Executive Decision starring Kurt Russell as well. 4.9, Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant. We're not actually here. It's the best of. Okay, what's the next one? What's the Educating Ricky? I don't know. See, like I say, I was looking around and there's stuff that is interesting, right? I was looking on the web, but there's no point. Well, it's just I found one about what's the point? About a lad who, eight years old but he's still breastfed. Now I don't know if you can get anything out of that. Is that what his mum said? What do you mean? I don't know if I can get anything out of that. You don't need to. No, it's just that, you know. Where do you read that? That was on the Internet. Oh, well, yeah. You're always unspecific when you mention it. It's just. It was on the Internet. Well, I'm trying to think what I put in. I think I put in Y to see if I'd confuse a computer. You are. No, honestly, I did a search putting Y and he came up with funny things that like why is this person doing that? Why is that? And had a picture of this eight year old lad sort of, you know, on his mum's nipple and it was saying, you know, is this healthy? You sure that wasn't asking you that question? I put in. Why? Just to confuse the Computer. What do you mean? Yeah, stop it. Yeah. Oh, look, yeah. Last week I was walking, come home with him and I went, he was saying something stupid. No, I've got a competition for next week, let's do a phone in and it's called Carl Pilkington, Genius or fool. Yeah, right. And he went, no, no. I went, why not? He went, well, it'd be confusing because they say there's no difference between genius and being a fool. No, no, but it's rubbish. And people say there's a fine line between madness and genius and you know, it's a ridiculous sound bite. They don't say there's a fine line between a genius and an idiot. Well, the people who do are idiots. Yeah. So what would you do there though? Just to sort of wrap that little thing up? What would you do? That lad loves his mum's. His mum's milk. What are you talking. What are you asking me to come up with? No, I'm title for the story. No, no, no, it's just, it's just what would you do? Right, what do you mean, what would I do? Well, it's causing a bit of a problem in the area, right? What area? In America, I think it was. Oh, America, a problem, are they? George Bush is worried about this kid who's breastfeeding 8. Imagine it like this, right, right. What are you asking me about this spurious story you saw on the Internet. I saw on the Internet there's an 8 year old lady likes his mum's milk and it's saying, is this right? Should it? No, it's not. But what, what do you want Ricky. To do about it? It's not his responsibility. Yeah, yeah, but, but the little town that he lives in, they're all causing an uproar, right, Going, this isn't right, you know, I letting a kid play out in case he's in the garden with his mum, getting a bit hungry. Right, so what should they do? Because his mum's saying, well, he likes it. Yeah. And he, you know what? So what do you do? I don't know. The laws. No, but I'm not asking you to sort out the laws. I'm just saying, if you lived in that neighborhood, what would you say if you went up to him and said, look, everyone's getting a bit fed up with this. What, what, what would I do? What do you mean what would I do? What are you asking me? Right, it doesn't matter. No, no, no, no. What are you asking me? What are you asking me? And Steve and The public saying, if. You live next door to this woman. Yeah, right, the kid's hungry, 8 years old, is out playing on his bike, and he goes, mom, I'm getting a bit peckish. And he goes, all right, son. She whoops one out and he starts having his. Having his milk, right? You live. You live next door, you put in your washing out and you see this going on. You're getting a bit sick of it because it's gone for months. Eight years. Why is it your business? Why are you such a nosy neighbour that you're concerned? What would you do, Carl? Let's turn it back on him. What would you do? What's your solution? What would you do? Well, I thought I'd say, right, why are you doing this? And she'd say, because he likes it. And I go, all right, then. Put it in a bowl first. And you think that would sort that out? No, because I was thinking about the whole thing. Right. And you do that when you're a baby and everything's all right in it. Yeah. No one bats an eyelid. That's a little baby having a bit of milk from its mum's breast. Right? Yeah. You'd almost say it was natural, but. You grow out of it. It's like you don't see. It got me thinking about things you don't see and you don't see. Did you put this into a computer? Show me things you don't see. What else don't you see? Well, you don't see. Like an old man having a Twix. You never. Oh, so what? You know the terrible thing about all this, Steve, is he's right. You don't see it all. No, I know. That's a terrible thing. So what they have got, right, They've made Old man's office, haven't they? They've come up with words. Is that a song? Oh. Oh, God. You don't see. So they've got their Werthers, right? Y. Look at him. You think he's giving a lecture at Oxford. It's not coming anywhere. No, go on. Sorry. Go on. I'm just saying you grow out of things. Yeah. And the old man, I'm sure when he was a kid he'd have a twit. Yeah. Now it doesn't look right. So he's having. It doesn't look right, so. Right. I don't think Werther's originals were specially designed for old people. I think they were sweets that just happened to have been made for years. That's why old People eat them. They didn't go, hang on, there's a market here. I've noticed old people aren't eating Twixies. Quick, let's make some old man sweets. But the little advert, he gives it to his grandson as well, doesn't he? Goes, Alva Werther's original. It cuts, though, before he throws it back in his face. Get me a twist. You've been voting in all week, sending your emails, so here's the clips that you wanted. You've got a real problem with Rick Waller, haven't you? I just. He probably turns my stomach. I know, but don't. Because he's arrogant as well. Exactly. That's the problem. To explain to people that, no, he. Is a bit arrogant. It's his whole thing that. It's the whole package, so to speak, that you don't. But there's no another thing in this quote because he's not. Just the fact that he eats too much. He. He tried, apparently to lose some weight. And it says, he said, the first month I lost 11 pounds, the next I lost a stone. But in the third, my body did somersaults and I put on nine pounds. I had a slip up. I can't say when, why or how, but it just sneaked up on me. Yeah. I don't believe it. Yeah, don't believe it just sneaked up. That body's never done a summer song in its life. No, it just sneaked up on him. Yeah, it was the cakes again. Yeah, it was the same old cakes as before. It's exactly the same. Sleep eating. Yeah, it's called. It was the KFC bucket. Family sized KFC bucket for breakfast. Poor man. The other thing is that I think that's a very good shock tactic for a doctor to tell a 20 something. Well, to be honest, you've got 20 years to live. Yeah, that's not. You know. And when I was 20, the thought of dying at 40 was fine. Yeah. I didn't want to live to 40. I just thought, oh, what can you do when you're 40? Yeah. Just laying around doing nothing, eating cheese. Cheese. And then you got there and you discovered. No, but someone said dream came from true. Sophia sent me something and she says, I realize you're not Graham Norton, but I had to send you this. And she sent me the top of a little cream cheesy thing. And it's, it's. The brand name is Gervais. How old that is? Have you been. They've named a cheese after you, I. Think It's a big French company and this is from the Czech Republic. It's all over Europe and so that. Would be a dream come true. Wouldn't if they named a cheese. No, I think it's, I think it's probably, you know, ancestors and so I've. Cheese is in my blood. Sure. Quite. It literally is. Yeah. Another heavy Friday night, was it? It comes out of pores like those play Doh things. Things I can squeeze out different shapes. Jay, bring the Stilton in. It's Friday night. This isn't fried exactly, but yeah. So we can't really have a go at Rick Waller. I, I, I, I eat too much. Yeah, but you're not big. I mean one of the other contestants on that on the Fat Club Celebrity is another one is Jono. Jono Coleman. Oh, we love John now, Jono, he's, I don't know, you know Jono, he's that guy does. He should be on tv and I think he does a breakfast show on arrival station, doesn't he? He's happy, isn't he? He's so trivial and he's a really nice bloke, Jono. But it's funny because he does a breakfast show on Heart, which is he's wrecking his own. There's a bit of irony. I love Carl. Thanks, Carl. Do you know what I mean? I can see where you're coming from. Yeah, that's good. But we've met Jono a couple of times. We saw him at a couple of. Not wishing to say, not to show off, but a couple of awards dues. Yeah, that's showing off. But people would have seen dead there. Well, yeah, but we, we went to one where everyone was in like tuxedos or suits and ties. Not Jono. Jono was wearing a pair of Bermuda shorts. Shorts with just these little. But I saw him again another time and he had shorts on at similar event and I've seen him since in the street and he's all. I don't think I'm wondering if he can wear trousers. I don't think he can actually wear trousers. I don't know if there's a medical reason for that, whether he's just his legs are too fat. I think the material is a waste of money. I think it's just that you can get shorts that big and they're comfortable and you know, I mean, to be quite honest, what I don't want to squeeze into a tuxedo anyway. So if you can go, I'd love to turn to those things. In Bermuda shorts? Well, of course, flip flops. Do you think he started off by wearing. Maybe he just had the upper half was a tuxedo with the tie and then the shorts and the shorts underneath. And he would just have to come in, sort of sneak behind, you know, a sideboard potty plant. Or A potty plant. Or his kids. Bring his kids ahead of him. Yeah, you know. Of course I am. Yeah. Yeah. Here you go. Kids move a bit. Well, no, and they just thought that this isn't fooling anyone. So now I'm going to make a wacky effort to sort of, you know. The next zone is. I've heard he's going in a grass skirt and a garland around us, and he's gonna. He's gonna come in limboing. But you. You did ask if you could go to the baftas in a dressing game, didn't you? Yeah, yeah. Right. Is this talking about diets and stuff? Right, go on. They've come up with a drug that they. They tested it out on a mouse, right. They said, you know, it's a problem at weight. Weight is a big issue in the world and, you know, a lot of people are depressed and that. Probably like Rick Waller. Well, I'm depressed looking at Rick Waller. Well, you know, I mean, you could sort out Rick by, you know, Jono is an old man. He's got loads of money. He's not old. No, but he's getting on a bit, Right. He's about. Hang on a minute. What I mean is, he does his own shopping, right? So I bet it's. Sorry, what do you mean? Because he's like. How old is he? 35. Right. He's got loads of money. He does his own shopping. So when he goes to supermarket and he passes, you know, the. The sponge cake section, it must be tough when you've got loads of money to burn that you go, just one more. Yeah. We are getting close to libel here, I think. No, no, I'm saying how it is because I've tried, like, losing a little bit of weight, and it is difficult when you, you know, you're in Waitrose and you see a little chocolate muffin and think, well, one more and I'll do without. Do you like a little chocolate muffin now and again? Yeah. Right. Is that your favorite thing? Let him finish his point. So the thing is, right now with Rick, he lives at home with his mom, so why doesn't his mam just say, I'm gonna buy less this week, and if you eat it all, you're not getting any more. Yeah, that, that sort that. Does he live? Short sharp shot. I bet he does. I bet he does. So you don't actually know if this is true or not? No, but, but anyway. Right, so this, this drug they've come up with, they tested this on Mike's, haven't they? No, I'm just. I'm worried if they haven't tested it on Mike. Thank God for that. It's definitely been tested on. Definitely. They fed a mouse a load of cake. Yeah, right. And it went a little bit chubby. And he said, right, stop a minute. And then they gave it this drug that makes you lose weight. Yeah. And its weight went down. But the only bad side effect was its eyes were popping out. Well, that seems. That seems to be fine then. Let's give it to Jono. There doesn't seem to be any problem. Oh, that's. Yeah. Rick should get some of that. Yes. Truth doc. Look at these. Oh, Jesus, John, are your eyes are popping out. That happened to the mice. Sorry? That happened to the mice. What do you mean that's the option? What do you mean that's the option? So. So I love the fact that your choice is either be like a fat happy man who has the odd sponge cake or a stick man with eyes on stalks. I mean, Steve's chosen that. All right, calm down. I thought we were slagging off Rick Waller. Fat people. Sorry. Let's have a go at the fat people before we start on me. Really? Yeah. No, I didn't. I thought. I mean, it's like. Yeah, yeah, cuz I got some body issues. I know, but I mean, Rick Waller's grotesque, you know? Yeah. Sorry, but I'm just a little bit. Weird, you know what I mean? Yeah. SHE PLAYS SONG well, it's just a little bit offended. All right. XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Bilington. Not here. It's the best of. You've been voting in all week, sending your emails. So is the clips that you wanted. Just take us back a few steps, Carl. What? What's, what's the story? Right, so I did some research. Right, let's just recap again. The guy. There was a guy you read about who had his head chopped off. He was guillotined. He had said to the people around him, I'm going to blink once I've had my head cut off or the brain can continue to work out. Yeah, okay, so. Yeah, we queried that. So you weren't having any of it? Well, no, Possibly for a few seconds till the oxygen stops being fed to the cells because the blood has drained away. But, you know, nothing spectacular. Yeah, along the similar sort of lines. Right, this is quite a few years ago, this fella sort of upset the Royal Family doing something, right? So they said that this isn't good. It wasn't been out under that jubilee thing. I can't remember what it was. And they said, right, that was terrible. We're gonna. We're gonna cut your head off. You know, you gotta. You gotta show people that you can't be doing what you've been doing. What Was this, the 1970s? When you say a couple years ago, you mean maybe sort of. Was it the olden days when the phones weren't very good? Ages ago, yeah, ages ago, sure. So. So. So, yeah, fair enough, yeah. So very philosophical. Yeah. Imagine that this was literally ages ago. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Simon Sharma's History of Britain. Yeah, yeah. Oh, and even before that, which is young before, when it was all mental and different. Sorry, Carl, go on. So he's having his head cough and he's. But he's resigned to it. It's the day before, he's kind of got it into his head now that I'm not gonna have me head much longer. Sure. So he said, let's. Let's make use of this, yeah. He said, I wonder how long, like, the body can stay alive without me head on it. Right? So they were like, oh, I don't know. So who were. So the jailers. Whoever. The jailers with one eye. Yeah, yeah, get that. So he said, no, wait a minute. I've got an interesting scientific experiment. Jailer. Well, fair enough. What is it? So he said, what I want to do. All right? He said, you know, surely it's me last, right? You know, I'm going to be. I'm going to be dead tomorrow. So let's. He didn't draw it out this long, did he? Yeah, he said, let's. Let's. Let's test this out, you know. He said, do us a favor. He said, you know, it's me last day. What I want you to do is you're going to cut me head off. Let's put a white line on the floor, right, and see if, you know. Because there's no point asking how far he can sort of walk without an ad if there isn't a line, because you don't know what to count. Do you know what I mean? If. It's just. If he loses his head and he's running around all over the place. You can't really count. That's not impressive enough. Yeah. So. So they said, let's make a white line. Sure. Yeah. Who said this? He did. All they did. I think they started to join in with him and say, well, let's make this a. Sure, you get it? Go on. So they got Norris McWhirter, the Guinness people. Oh, yeah. So they said, let's get this white line. Yeah. Dedication's all you need. We'll. We'll do this. We'll do this tomorrow. And he said, all right, I'll see you in the morning. Morning. I'll see you in the morning. Night, night. Sleep tight. Bye. Bye. I love the fact that Car knows exactly what was said. He doesn't know the story or what order is in or when it was exactly what. But he knows the. All right, then. See you in the morning. Bye. Little kissy, kissy, kissy. Oh, not. I'm not like that. Oh, you joker. Don't let the bedbugs by. Yeah. Anyway, so he gets up. Do you want a paper tomorrow? No, I'm all right. Go on. He gets up and they say, right, you know, today's the day and night. And he said, well, you know, I've got. Got used to the idea. So here's. Here's a white line for you. Go on. So. So they go, right, you ready, then? And he said, I. Go on. And he cut his head off and the body walked 32 steps without a head. Wow. 32 steps. Incredible. And that's. That's. That's the lesson, really. Did it get as far as the. What? It walked along the white line. Did it? Yeah, it stayed along the white line, did 32 steps and then started to stumble a bit and it just fell over. Yeah. But, you know, it was a test that your body can still keep alive for a little bit. Yeah. When. When you've lost your head. Absolute twaddle. Absolute twaddle. What do you reckon you can do then without an ed. How many? Nothing. There'd be muscular spasm, Right. Yeah. It would twitch a bit. Yeah. You could not distinctly take 32 steps. The body. Well, don't. Yeah. It's the doctor still on the line. The fellow that bought six parrots. Yeah. And, you know. Incredible. 32 steps. Right. So you're heading down, doing a bit of line dance. Right. You don't believe that for something that. You do believe that a cockroach can live a week without an head. It can down slightly different. Slightly different kettle of fish there. Why? Wow. Insect to human is, is what I'm thinking. Yeah. Difference. There's not that much difference in some insects. Do you know that a snake has a heart and lungs and kidneys and stuff? Go on. No. Well, I'm just saying. So you're making out as if like they're a totally different like species. I am, I am making that. I mean, call me old fashioned. Do you know what you're talking about? I don't want you embarrassing yourself, Rick. Yeah, I am suggesting that totally different beings. Yeah, that is. Yeah. Now Carl, the, the cockroach is, is a very different thing. The interesting there is that it lives, it lives by its head because a lot of it's on. There's some of my phototropic chemotropic. Some of them just literally have irritation and muscle memory. I mean they do have a central nervous system, but it, it's, it's three different. So if you lose the head, it bypasses a lot of that. Anyway, all this is running around. The reason it dies is it can't take off on water. But it's very different to a man, right. Having consciousness and then losing that. And the body's still going. Now I remember, I think I remember what I was gonna do here. Yeah. So I'm Gonna carefully walk 32 steps along this white line. I might just go looking out, going. Missed a bit. Maybe the head was in the corner. Going left, left. Yep, left. Oh, he's now. Well, let's just put it out. I mean if, if anyone listening has, has maybe had a Reddit of beheaded, maybe in a horrendous car accident. But they got up, maybe they went for a walk, they, you know, they, they had a little chat. Get in touch. You are my favorite being. You are my favorite species. Now you, Carl, may not be particularly different genetically from a cockroach. You are. Cockroaches do that. Why you have a maiden when. Let's play a record. Do you know what? When I told him this fact, I send him little facts on text messages just to inflame him his, you know, interest. I just sent him a cockroach can live nine days without his head. He texted back, what's the point of that? Yeah, what's the point? They're not doing experiments, these cockroaches. It's a boring last week to have. And he went on top all that. You're thirsty. So it's the worst week of your life, is it? That week without your head. Xfm 104.9 on R with me, Stephen Merchant. You're listening to the best of basically Carl Pilkington. Carl's all flustered because there isn't a record set up, but he's getting all tizzy. He's been more worried about his competitions and sorting out, putting records on. Ready? Well, I'm after Steve's song for a Lover. I'll tell you what, you. Why didn't you carry on with your Educating Ricky section? I'll have a look on the. On the screen. We'll keep it going, Steve. Yeah, go on. Go on, then. Right, okay. We've had. We've had a few emails. Anyone got it right, Carl. Educating Ricky. That's the final word. We've got to get that out of the way. We've got to get Rock Buster as well, though. But we've only got five minutes left. Come on, just do Educating Ricky. Right. God, the. The last one that we haven't done. Right. He's a bit of a nuisance. Go on in again. Not. Not really. Not really that interesting. Thanks. No, like, again, I spoke to you in the week and I had much better things, like when I tell you about Brian blessed climbing Everest and for some reason it made him. Played havoc with his belly and what he followed through and he had to clean up. Shot himself. Yeah, using. Using ice and stuff. Why did you tell. Why are you telling me that, Brian? Bless. What. In what way is telling me that Ryan blessed himself once in any way educational? Because I was saying how it. It was climbing Everest. Right, right. Give it to him. He's an actor and that, but he gave that a go. Yeah, right. It played. What's the point of that? You'd say, wouldn't it? Yeah, you'd say, God, he's. He's, you know. Oh, so he's all right. I mean, me doing a boxing match, there's no reason is rubbish. But him climbing Everest and shitting himself. Yeah, he did that. It's commendable. Right, and he's only gonna, like, go and do it again. He's gonna climb it again. Yeah, but he might not shoot himself this time. What's the point in going. Nothing's changed up there. Yeah, well, it has. They've probably. They've probably cleared out by now. But his slip on it. I can't hear about telling you this one because. Come on, do it now. Steve, how we doing? Look, no, no, never mind that. Look, just tell me what that means. Oh, he's a nuisance. Oh, this is so annoying, Carl. I'm gonna go mental. Right, talk. Right, listen, I'm just Right, right. Nuisance is a bit of a nuisance. Yeah, yeah. Apparently the old fella who used to hang people. Yeah, yeah. He used to be able to tell somebody's weight just by looking at them. Right. That's a bit of a bonus fact. We'll be the judge of that. The thing, the thing that I wanted to tell you is money for old ropes. Do you know what I'm saying? I can't even be bothered. Yes, you're going to tell me now. Come on, Carl. I mean it. Basically money for old rope came from the. Right. What was all that about? He can tell someone's weight and blind blessed hitting himself now what are you. What? No, don't you. No, tell me that now. You nearly made me swear then. Just. I'm getting really annoyed. I'm getting really annoyed now. Tell me this, fat Carl, or I'm gonna go mental. Come on, Carl, time's running out. Well, that people years ago when people used to be hung. Right, right. If you didn't like the person who's been hung, you'd go, God, I really don't like him. And. And so you never forget the time being hungry. We take that as red. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So they never forget afterwards to get the hangman to get the rope and to cut it up into little pieces and he'd sell them. It sell a little piece of the rope to people. See that, Carl? That's the most interesting thing if it's true that you've come up with. Right, okay. And so what's. What's so they sell the rope. They sell the rope and it's money for old rope. Money for old rope meaning like, you know, God, it's easy to make money. I'll have to do do is cut it up and sell it. I'm. See, I'm not so convinced though. We're really tight. We haven't even got time for a last try. We've got an ad break and we've got to give out. Okay, give the answers then. This is ridiculous. So come on, Steve, do you want to pick a winner? I've got a winner when you give us the answers. Okay, so the first clue was that army has got some well nice trenches. Yeah, that was DW who's that? Dandy Warhols. That's brilliant. That's brilliant. That's good. Yeah. Gone the top of them curtains erect, all the material is worn. H.V. that's Holly Valance. Oh, he got a phone call for what I was saying. I haven't heard it. And she went. She was. He was talking to her off air and she went, what is it? Someone says them all, right, so, you know the thing around the top of the curtain is a Palmett, not a Valance. And he went, cut her off. Yeah, but my aunt is always making balances on everything. I'll tell you about that next week. Right. I'm looking forward to that. Is this the one that farted for five minutes? Yeah, yeah, very. So same. Yeah. Right, so we'll talk about that. I was in Texas. I tripped up. I landed on my knees in a puddle. Wh. Yeah. Wet knee, Houston. Right? Wet knee, Houston. Yeah. So you're a maniac. So who's a winner? We've got Pete, Catherine and Laura in Newcastle Upon Time. They're listening online, I assume. And those great reasons. Remember, they've got loads of stuff. They've got the DVD here, they've got Linda Green, got Stone Roses, they've got another compilation and Executive Decision. What do you read about about Brian Blessed? Is it actually true or have you a lie with someone else? It was an interview with him in it. And what did he say? Come on, what did he say? He said I climbed Everest and I played of it with me belly. Let's talk about it next week. We really run out now. Oh, you're a fool.",
