  "text": "Five past one, then already over Saturday. So I'm Ricky Gervais. That was placebo. Yeah. With special needs. Which brings me to my next point with me, Carl Pilkington. There he is. Steve Merchant, 104.9. That's it. We're back then. Well, for one last time. Well, it's certainly the end of the season. We're away for at least, you know, two months. We're doing the Office Special and possibly forever, depending on whether Carl decides he wants to carry on with this. Because, I mean, we do this for fun. We don't need to do this. We don't need to do this for, you know, money, obviously not the kind. Of money you're earning. Rick, you do not need to do this. I don't need to do it. It's quite honestly beneath me. Yeah. You know, we don't need to do it to further our career because it's embarrassing being, say, do not even bother. Cashing those XFM checks. It's not worth your while. No, it's not. It's not. Yeah. The time it took to sign them, it wasn't worth it. So we do this basically to ridicule Carl on a large sort of platform. I say large platform. No other. No other radio station will have us. Roughly the same as standing up in McDonald's. I imagine so. But other lunchtime though. Yeah. Yeah. Or when it's just the cleaning staff mopping up. Yeah. So. And if Carl doesn't come back, he's breaking up the three way partnership. He's very much a sting, isn't he? What, 1986? 87. Exactly. He's gonna go off and sort of make some quite poor sort of jazz inflected white man soul and leaving us to go about our business. Play pizza places. Exactly. Yeah. Well, I'm gonna go into sort of maybe. Dad, why can't I be in the CIA? You don't know anything about it. You're a drummer. Yeah. So we'll have to see. I mean, do you think anyone cares? I wouldn't have thought so because I think if someone was interested in having some good chat and some great laughs, they'd spend more time with their friends. Yeah. Or listen to another radio show. Or listen to a decent radio show. They listen to XFM for some music to have one in the background that's loud enough. Yeah. So they can hear it while they're hoover. Yeah. I don't think our fans hoover. Well, true. I think you've got. Or shoot up, whatever. I think you've got Have a house. Yeah. I tell you what I do want, though, some great music. They do indeed. They'll be saying since you've been gone. See that, that's the sort of link I can do if we stay. If you could cut out all the other drivel you speak, you'd be great on magic. I know. Yeah, you've got a. Come on. I know. You've got a rainbow something. Rainbow. You got a rainbow something. Oh, it's Rainbo. Well, I mean, for last show, that song had everything. It's got. It's got two guitar solos. Yes. It's got a key change, it's got bad grammar. Since you've been gone by rainbow. And that's for Canfield, the Prince of Rock. Yeah. He's going to be the king when Vance, you know, just hands over his. His crown. Yeah. And you've still got that on xfm, so, you know, don't worry about us going, oh, you weren't. Oh, okay then. No one cares, no one cares. This is our last show, let's make it a good one. Let me give out the email address because I imagine there's going to be a flood of emails. Please, Carl, keep the team together. Yes, it's Jono Coleman. Tuck. Coleman's not a team, he's just a big lad. Yeah, right. Come on. What do you mean, come on? I've got nothing. Ricky Dodge or Carl Dot Pilkington, because you can do it throughout the week, you can do it throughout the two months. And what's the. What's the phone number for XFM0207? Is it 7 double 6 6000? And then just ask people through the car and leave a message on his voicemail. Yeah. So email him a lot. 02077 double six six thousand, I think. And just ask for Carl Pilkington, little Carla Pilkington, little baldy mank twit and say please stay. Yeah, please stay, Carl. Say something then. Oh, it's your last show. Say hello. What your feelings, Carl, so far? I mean, this. Are you cheerful? Are you upset? Not at all, no. Can't wait for 3 o' clock. So it was interesting how Ricky was saying he only does it for the fun. I haven't even got that bit. I am paid peanuts to work Saturdays, which wrecks me weekends. You get monkeys. I have no fun. Right, you have a lot. And what people? You love this, you love this. You love me coming in and having a little chat beforehand and after. Yeah, but that's the funny thing. And it listeners just think why? Why does he get so moody about it having Ricky annoying him just on a Saturday? Yeah, it's not just of a Saturday. Why it's in the week as well. How do I annoy you? How do I annoy you daily? How do I annoy you, Carl? So you can't be specific. See the first thing that springs to mind when I'm trying to work with Steve before saying, come on, let's, you know, find some interesting stuff to talk about. I think you're playing the accordion in the air. Was it the accordion? It doesn't really matter, they get the idea. Although I can't play the accordion so it wasn't very good, was it? Where did you find an accordion? I just went out there. Right. And then. So the drum kit you started playing. With and then I had a loudspeaker and I put the accordion then it loud. Those loudspeakers, they're amazing. My question is this, Carl, do you honestly think that's going to stop just because we're not on air anymore? He's not going to see you on a Saturday so he's just going to come in even more often? Yeah, I can just drop it. Won't bother me as much though. I think he will. And he'll have his fob taken off him so he won't, he won't be able to just wander in. Of course I won't. So. Well they're not. You think, of course they're going to let Ricky Gervais walk in anytime they want. Yeah, I might come in. Might do. A few trailers, might hang out, you know with Andrew going, hey Andrew, how's it going? You go. Yeah, we're having a bit of trouble, what do you think? I say lose that off the playlist. Put that one on sack then. Yeah, let's have a little bit of feeder. Yeah, that's all we want. Yeah. Feeder. Forget about tomorrow. At least we're here today Steve. The three of us for an hour and a half more. The last time ever possibly is up to little baldy head mankey. Well Carl Pilking Todd a number of emails. Rick, this is from Matthew Davis. I think he very much captures the mood of the email public. His. His email is just simply titled Go in the name of God go. It says why wait till 3? Why not leave immediately and stop subjecting us to this abject. Well Carl did once when he had to get a train of course, so that's never happened on radio before but. Who knows, I mean stay tuned. We might shoot off at 20 to 2. Or we might get better. We might get better. We might get better because we've done planning. Because I got Carl around last night, really, to do some planning of the show, didn't I? And so I thought you were going. To be there, Steve. No, I wasn't talking about it. Yeah, well, I called him up, I said, why, what we doing? He said, well, you can come round and, you know, have a chat, maybe get some ideas and that tomorrow. So I said, is Steve there? Yeah, Steve. Steve will be coming. Yeah. So go around. It's close. Next. Next to his flat. It couldn't. The pub couldn't be closer. Yeah, all right. Yeah. Unless there was sort of spirits not in the lift. It couldn't have got closer. Ye. Yeah. I turn up, you're not there. No, he's lied. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you wouldn't come out if it was just like you thought I was gonna muck around. I had to pretend it was work to get you out. So you weren't there, Steve. No. Anyway, so he says, oh, come in the flat, you know, got. Got an interesting book that. That you'll like. Okay. So I think, well, that's kind of work, you know, he's trying and that. Yeah. So I go in thinking, we're going to get some. Some good ideas and that from this book. Couldn't find the book. He looked for about 40 seconds, said, I don't know where it is. Come on, let's come in here, let's have a wrestle. So I'm sat in the lounge, sat there just chatting to his girlfriend and that. Just chatting. He comes wandering out in his underpants. Yeah, well, I was comfortable. Yeah, I don't know if you were comfortable because we sort of pulled up right between the crack. Right. Looked like, okay, probably like a gay sumo wrestler. Yeah, yeah. And I did a little dance for you, didn't I? Because there was MTV on. I was doing a little dance, dancing. To Elton John's new one. Yeah, yeah. And what did you say? What did you say when I was doing a little dance for you and my pants pulled up like. Right. Do you remember what you said? You went, I poured him a drink. He's in my home, I'm entertaining him. He goes, are you sure you're not a bender? Is that any way to treat a host? I think it was the right time to ask. But we did do some work, didn't we? Because you. Then you got confused and you said. He said, you know, oh, God, it's like a child or a Cat, when it's confused. He went, steve reckons in ancient Greece, right, it was better to shag a bloke than a woman. And I went, well, yeah, I mean, that's about the male being sort of a first class citizen. Much better. Wasn't it an aspiration to sleep with a beautiful man than a beautiful woman? Women were lower class citizens, so therefore men were seen as a, as higher class. So to have sexual relations with a man was. There was no shame in that. No, it was looked up and I said, well, you know, ancient Rome, I said, even Nero, he used to, you sit in his big jacuzzi and he used to get, you know, pretty boy men to go into the water and just nibble at his testicles while he was having a watch. He did, yeah. And he's not a gay fella. No. Well, no, I mean, you know, I don't know about Nero, but I mean, it wasn't, it wasn't a case of a big delineation between what was heterosexual and what was gay. It was just, you know, whatever you. So what, what did this fella do then, this one who's having his. Well, he was, he was pretty much top, top boy Nero for a while he was in charge and, you know, and they. You did what? He did what you're told if Caesar or. But why were people going around there? Why don't they go, oh, no, they weren't dropping in. I didn't like the doors opening. I was gonna see if Nero's doing. It's not like when I pop in here. Yeah. Normally what would happen is he'd say, come back to my place, I got a book for you. Yeah. You pop in but you come out in his pants. You'd have probably been like a delivery boy or a stable boy or something, you know, and you'd have popped around there and you'd have gone there at Nero as the tablets of stone you wanted and go, pilkington, why are you out here? Pop under. I don't know why he's French. What is that? I don't know why he's French. Just pop under the water and nibble at my testicles. And you'd have done it because he was Nero. I wouldn't. He wouldn't. There's no way I would have done. Yeah, well, you wouldn't find him. I've dropped a pizza off. Right. I'd say, I've done my job. Yeah. That's not the sort of tip I wanted. No. Eda said, get the little baldy chap to nibble on testicles. And you'd remember. What? I wouldn't have done it. Can I just say this, Steve? Not only would you be nimbus testicles, you'd have been going mad. You'd have been noshing him just for extra. You'd have had a. You'd been doing everything he wanted. You'd have been going, either gone. I didn't ask you to do that. You'd have been going. Mentally. They'd have been chewing, slurping, smacking, poking. You'd have chopped. You'd have. You'd have gnawed his packet off. You think you're eating Walker's crisps. There'd be bubbles, there'd be flood. Oh, it'd be horrible. The Beatles from the soundtrack to the Yellow Submarine, actually. And that's Hay Bulldog on XFM 104.9. Our last show, maybe me, Ricky, Steve and little Carl. All right, Carl. But that book, that. That wasn't a fake. It wasn't like just a ruse to get you back to show you me and dancing in pants to Elton John. It's that. What was your girlfriend doing during that, incidentally? I think she was just getting on with sort of like packing up sort of boxes because we were moving. She was. I don't think what. She's seen all before. Yeah. And the book was. Do you remember that book that I showed you that it was a man's body, an owner's manual, and it's just like loads of stats and there's one in there. Yeah, it's kind of like a Guinness Book of Records of men. Yeah, yeah. There's one section there that was. Sorry, hang on. It's not like Guinness Book of Records of Men. That just sounds a little bit like you and I were sat around your house looking at a big book. A big man book. He is a big man, isn't he? He should be on the front cover. Yeah, it was a book more about the kind of physical body. Exactly, yeah. Biology and social and, you know, sex and all that sort of stuff and that. Which is where as we got the knob news for today from. Right, this is. This is true. Right. I read that the. Oh, you left someone's eye out. Knob news, then you've got the jingle. Yeah. I read that the smallest ever functioning penis. Right. Was under three quarters of an inch when erect. Extraordinary. That is bad luck in it. And it's a micro penis, so it's perfectly, perfectly scaled down. Just a little. It's a little. Look at Carl's face welcome. The fellow have said, look, right, I'm not happy about it, so don't print it. It's not the sort of press people want, is it? There wasn't a picture of him. It was anonymous. They didn't read the book. And at work next day, and look at this, Frank. What? Smallest ever penis half an inch? He didn't go, it's me. He just went, yeah, loser. Yeah. You know what I mean? Anyway, let's have a shower. I'm all right, I'm all right. He must have had to have a little jod with a pair of tweezers. Yeah. Presumably because you couldn't even get a fist. I mean, no, that is bad luck, isn't it? Was he a good looking fellow? What would you do, right, if he invited you around and said, right, and he was like the king, right, and he went, oh, Carl can just go in there and just nibble at it. And you've gone under the water and you're just about to nibble it and you go, you come up and you go, that's tiny. Would you be disappointed or relieved? Right, well, that wouldn't happen. No, Carl, I'm saying if it did, would you be. Would you be disappointed? Would you go, oh, that I can't even get. I don't know where to start with that. Or would you go, oh, thank God it's not a big one. You've got to remember that he's the emperor, so you've got to do what he says or he'll have you killed. What would you do? Would you, would you go, oh, I love lovely set a tackle. Or oh, it's not as big as I wanted. Or would you secretly think I'm glad it's not big because I didn't want to because I'm not that guy. I'm not. I'm not even gonna think about it because I wouldn't do it. I know I wouldn't do it. Even back then. Even back then. What, when was, when was Nero at it? Well, the Roman Empire was sort of like 2000. Well, it stretched. Yeah. Yeah. So it's a long time ago. Yeah. I wouldn't, I wouldn't do it. You'd have to. You'd have to. I always remember we're still doing knob news. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, in, you know, I didn't do that well at school and that, Right. But we had biology and I didn't take, I didn't take much of it in, but there's one day when, when it was about, you know, knob news and stuff. Sure. And it was all about how blood, you know, is what makes engorges. Yeah, the erectile tissue. Sure, yeah, it was all about that. And there's this girl in our class called Paula, right. We sat there watching it and she fainted. You just had to go, oh. And she hit the floor. Right. Because we're all sat on top of the desk watching this. I wasn't really. What? I wasn't that interested in that. No, I wasn't looking at it. But Paula, right, she. She fell over and the funny thing was. Right, what was it? A video. Yeah. A video of like this, this clod. Yeah. Doing. Doing the business to this fella's member. Right. And she fell over like. And everyone's like, oh, what's up with her? And the teacher was trying to like wake her up and give her water and that. And it was really weird because then the nurse came in and yet this video was still playing and the nurse come in. What happened? Well, she's seen this. Yeah. And you could hear like, you know, then it was going on to like sex education on the video. It was all done from start to finish. What happens? And by the end. And she was still out cold by the time it got to like. And then they had a baby. Yeah. Yeah. Right. And so it seems to me that. That was a sex education class. She fainted when the penis got erect and when she woke up a baby was born. That's probably she thinks happens. She's wandering around now. The whole class just missed out of it cuz they saw someone with the. Bloke and he gets interaction. She just goes, oh, she was a. Bit of a class tart really. That's why. But she was, that's. Everyone was like, what's up with her? It's now not as if she's not seen it before, but just reminded me then. Weird. But anyway. Yeah, so I wouldn't, I wouldn't. Anyway, let's leave Nero aside. Yeah. The other thing in this should play record and come back. There's another interesting fact. There is some extraordinary facts in there. Yeah. There was a more fact we're running over. It won't be knob news. It won't be knob news. There'll be all different types of news. Libertines. Don't look back into The sun on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant and Kyle Pilkington. For possibly the last time ever. I was coming in today, Steve, and I was walking Just past Shaftesbury Avenue, at the beginning of Shastra Avenue. And it's sort of a little bit of a tramps corner going on there. And there's a couple of tramps. Proper. Proper tramps. Already had a few. And about sort of like 40, maybe. Right. Or that they could be 30. They could have a hard life. They probably have. But he was going. To. John is coming down, but Les isn't gonna make it. And I think they're just planning their social. Yeah. And meeting there. I just think that they. That's nice. They've got, you know, they don't just drink by themselves. Yeah. What are we doing tonight? I thought we'd get drunk and sleep in the zawi. We did that last night. But I just like the idea that they're planning it and they've got mates and they do stuff and they go, all right, how's it going? Well, we know it's going. Yeah. I'm sitting next to you in a pile of pits. You know how it's doing. I was also thinking, do you think they ever wake up, like before they've had anything at 9 o' clock and go, oh, I was pissed last night. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you were talking absolute rubbish. What was I doing? You were just going, you're just shouting. At cars, walking in the street. You're joking. Was I really embarrassing? Yeah, you were pretty drunk. I'll tell you this, I am never gonna do that again. Oh, but at least I didn't make a pass at Dirty Agnes. Oh, God, what did I do? You just go, yeah, for your chef. Just love the idea. They have normal little conversations and that's. I measured one of them going, I'm not coming out tonight. I've got no money. Nor have we yet. I'm just gonna go and dance. Just go dance outside my garden. I only made 18p today. You know what? Because I always, you know, I've always had a soft spot for the homeless. But you remember that time I was walking over to yours once and see, there's the homeless people, there's those ones that they try to retain a certain dignity by. They won't just come up and ask you for money. They'll come up and maybe try and start a conversation before introducing the fact that what. What you despise annoys you is the try that. The thing they're trying to hold on to is a little bit of pride. I know. And you, what would you want to do? Just be crushed in a skip going, I'm just give me some money. Look at me. Come out and say it. You know, Come out and say it. But don't try and fool me because sometimes I feel like I've been tricked. I get annoyed because I feel like I didn't see you coming. You came out of left field, you know, you were a tramp. I imagine the fact that they're bare chested, apart from a blanket, with their hand out, covered in sores and no teeth is a clue. Not really. This was one of those ones. You sometimes see them, the ones, they're slightly older and they've got a full suit on. They wear a complete suit, like a pinstripe suit or something with maybe trainers, admittedly, yeah. And I sometimes think to myself, you know, at what point in that moment before they finally left the house for the last time did they think, well, I'm gonna be homeless. I want to look good if I'm gonna be home, but unless I'm sleeping rough, but it doesn't have a pinstripe. It can happen in a matter of days or weeks. Anyway, listen, I don't. I'm not begrudging the fact that he asked for money. That's fine. I just felt a little bit annoyed because I thought he was an ordinary person, right? And he came up to me and he said to me, and he said to me, excuse me, mate, if you got the time? And I said, whatever, you know, 10 past three. And he went, have you got any money? And I knew that I was annoyed and it annoyed me because I thought I should have known straight away. I mean, a Thomas person, you know, I sensed it. Sensed it straight away. Yeah. Excuse me, if you got the time, I wanted to say to him, where have you got to be? Well, yeah, what appointments have you got? Well, no, maybe he goes to work, he starts begging at 3:00. Yeah. He asked all that day, he goes, what's time to go? Quarter four, you know what I mean? Then he goes, oh, give us some money. It's three o' clock, right? Maybe there's the mornings off. It might have been his day off. He was doing half day or, you know, shift work. Yeah, he might. You know what I mean? You never know what shifts. I just think when you see those people from shelter or from famine relief in the street, they got to wear those kind of those little things over their clothes that say where they're from or at least some kind of name tag so you know when you're stopped by them, you know what to expect. They got a clipboard. I know these homeless people who come. Out of here, they look like regular people. They come lurching out like zombies. You go, oh, you think this. That's an attractive woman. She's just come over. Oh, no, look, she's got a dog on a piece of string. I know, yeah. I just think they've got to come out with it. They should just come out of it. Just be honest, you know, be proud. Those people with the things sometimes annoy me is where they stand right in the middle of the pavement. I have to zigzag. I have to cross the road four times to get through them. It's like. It's like playing getaway on video, avoiding all these up and down Oxford Street. You have to really. They come out worse than they recognize me. That's why I've got about eight standing orders now where I've been caught. I leave the house and I'm. It's just like people are trying to take my money from me. Between my house and the tube, there's just swarms of people trying to take my money from me at any cost. Carl's got his first little direct debit, haven't you? Five quid a week or so quite for the month. Yeah. I've joined some. Something to help Africa out. I quizzed her for a bit. I mean, she came over and she was saying. He was talking to her for about 40 minutes. Yeah. Just making sure your money was going right to the right place. Yeah. I was saying, you know, why have I got to give you my bank details? This is the thing. And I was saying, so I'm sure you'd make more money, right, if you just had a little thing that you put money in. I said that I want to help you out, right. But it's the fact I've got to give you bank details. And she's saying, no, this is the way we guarantee we make money. And you know, we can help places out because we could be out all day and we could only earn like 50p whereas, you know, we know that it's worth us standing around. Yeah. So I was like, well, fair enough. So what's, what's my money going to be doing then? And I think it's called care, Care of the world or something. Yeah. And she's saying we're giving them money to buy hammers and we're not just going to give them money to blow in and stuff. They've got to like work and don't give them money. Well, what did you think of these people? Just like these drought planes. It's a gift. So they have to buy a hammer. No, they go with the buckets and go, all right. And they throw it up and they go, bundle. Yeah. She. She was making out anyway, right. That she was nice enough. She was selling it to me. She said, you know, we give them the tools and they feel good because they're building up their own place and everything. And so fair enough. Right. And now I've done that for two months. They've got a tenor off me already. I'm checking it, making sure they're not ripping me off and that if I ever go to Africa and I need a hammer and there isn't one. Yeah. I'll be delivered. You'll be livid because, you know, it is a lot of money. Sure, sure. Every month. Fiverr. Yeah. And you know, you're talking about people hassling you and that in the street. I actually moved flat in the last flat I lived in. I moved from there because of the. The hassle that was. Yeah, it was a high street and you couldn't. Like you were saying, you nip out for a loaf and spend about 40 quid just. Just on people saying, give us the money for this. Samaritans trumps, heart attacks, old people or whatever it's like. So it ended up pushing me off that street. No, I can't handle this. It's getting crazy out there. They measure those little stalls. Yeah. Hey, but listen, let's make the world a better place with a little bit of music. Oh, thanks, Bauhaus. Yeah. Give generously, people. House's version of David Bowie's ziggy Stardust on XFM 104.9 and Wicked Age would be Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkins, and possibly for the last time. And as a special treat, a return, sort of like a summer special, an end of term. Well, a gift to the fans. Carl is bringing back Rockbusters. Do you want to explain it? Rockbusters is basically blockbusters, completely ripped off, done with music that may or may not be a cryptic clue and my not be the actual band name and may or may not be the actual letters he said they were in the first place. Do you want to sort of describe one, though, in case someone's a new listener? Wow. Exploding Pet was Atomic Kitten. Yeah. Okay. Basically, for those of you are new to the show, this is the final show. Carl reads out what he considers to be a cryptic clue. It's not cryptic, it's just some words, just a string of words. And from that you are supposed to deduct the name of an artist or a group or a band. We've had things like the Jamaican fella swinging a Fish Round. That was Detrout Spinners. So that's the sort of. That's the level of intellect you are getting from Carl Pilkington. What was the one? Just do the competition. What? I was thinking you, was it. She fell down. Houston. She fell down into a puddle in. Texas on the knee. What Knee? Houston. Yeah. So you said it twice. It's not cryptic. So just do it. Come on. Right, so there's three of them. And you email in your answers. We've got some good prizes today and that. Right, well, let me tell you the prizes. You know. Yeah. The competition's bad enough, let alone just listen. We've got three DVDs, brilliant. Six CDs. He's got the Young ones and all that. Lot of TV things. There's some great CDs. Yeah, go on. Right, so the first one, cryptic clue. This vegetable and started life down under. Right. This vegetable started life down under. The initials ko. Right. Ko. This vegetable started life down under. Second one. The things that you normally find on the beach. Right. I've been found floating around the moon. Right, yeah, that's. I think it's ts. I think it's ts. You set the questions but you're not sure. So the things you normally find on the beach have been found floating around the moon. Right. And the last one. Well, if you put that many in the post, I'm surprised I didn't receive one. He thinks they're great. He thinks he's brilliant. Well, you know, if you put that many in the post, I'm surprised I didn't receive one. Is it lacked in. He did all that. Yeah. The initials there. FC. FC. FC. Right. So you email in the answers. Ricky.gervais. xfm.co.uk. win that. Hey, let's slam dunk in some sounds. Well, slam dunk some ads first. Okay. That will be the next single from DMX. That's called where the Hood at on XFM 104.0. It bloody better be. I know you're from a fan. You enjoyed it. You love a bit of hip hop, don't you? Xfm 104.9. Yeah, keep it real. Hippie hop. Yeah, Sweet man, Sweet stuff. It's that kind of lingo and that kind of patois that they won't be hearing next week. No, I know. Off making some bling bling. All right, so that's the story. Yeah, yeah, sweet. It's weird. All that. All that talk and that, is it. I don't know what it's called. Excellent. What do you mean? No, just all that bling, bling and all that, because I. I didn't understand it right. So I did a bit of. Did a bit of research. Brilliant. That's what you should do if you don't understand something. Yeah. I mean, always good times, you know, do that. No, I'm giving you props for even doing this. Yeah. Massive respect and big you up. Yeah, go on. But it's all slang. Is it really? Is it really? So it's not in the. Really? That's odd. No, I don't remember it being in Romeo and Juliet, but then. So you didn't. You didn't speak like that when you went to Oxbridge? What? Never mind. But no, I did a bit of research into it. Right. And one of the things that they use. Yeah. Is. Oh, I was out last night, did a 187. Yeah. That's a murder. Yeah, but why you slang. Right? Because apparently 187 is police slang. Yeah, it's not slang. It's a. It's a code. Well, don't. Don't use what the police know you're talking about. Yeah, I don't think they do it with police around. Probably not. Carry on, then. Yeah. I always remember the cockney rhyming slang supposedly originated because, you know, East End villains or whatever would make up their own slang so that if they're overheard in conversation, then they won't know what they're talking about. But just look, you know, just look it up in some kind of cockney rhyming slang. Yeah, I like that idea. Okay. Where is he? Where's Fingers? Wow, Copper. I'm gonna tell you this. He's up the apples and pears. I know what that means. Well, leave the house then. If you don't know that he's hiding up the apples and pears, you might as well shoot off. Exactly. Well, I can't possibly figure that out, so I'll just have to shoot off. Yeah. Where was he last seen? He was last seen with his trouble and strife. I know what that means. Well, you might as well shoot off, then. Yeah, it's a perfect code. Of course, though, talking about Shakespeare, Shakespeare invented 1200 words and slang gets in. So there are more and more words, and slang soon becomes, you know, the norm. There's no. There's no. Not real words and real words, you know. Do you know? I mean, they're just as valid if they're Common parlance. So they all become part of the. Or they fade away and they're not used because they're a fad. Yeah. Like waz up. Yeah, that. That. That's probably in the dictionary, that is. Yeah. Or soon to be. I was reading. Was it a couple of years ago. You're gonna like this. Not a lot. Right. Got into the. Yeah. So popular things got in there. Imagine that. Yeah, you're gonna like this. Not a lot. Zigga. Zig R. I think got in or something. Oh, no. Girl power. Got in. Girl power as a. As a. As a common phrase. Sorry, go on. No, no, no, you have to. No, it's just. It's just that with the slang thing. Did I tell you I was trying to read that. That book about the governor? Oh, yes. And that. That was full of that. And it had a page on the front that you had to keep going to when. You know what I mean? When he used a bit of slang, you had to sort of go, right. I don't know what he means. Glossary. Right. Just knit back, have a look. I thought you meant when you said, there's a page at the front. I thought you meant the COVID with his face on. I can't remember who I'm reading about. Oh, there he is. Is this the book that you nearly finished reading, but you realized all the pages were in the wrong order? No. He bought a cheap book, right. A second shot, started reading it, loving it. Then he started reading about this bloke and he went from jail to school, and then he looked at the page numbers and they were all out of order. How annoying is that? You never read books, do you? I never. Never read one. Right. And Suzanne, it was a weekend when we were going to Hastings because you two had done me adding, right. She said, I'm gonna take you away. So you relax and what have you. So ended up not relaxing because it was like putting the jigsaw together. I decided reading on the train, thinking, loving this. It's really interesting story about this fella who, you know, didn't have a great life as a kid, starts getting into a bit of crime, what have you, turns out to be the governor. But it wasn't as easy as that because, like you say it was. Started off at school, then he was in prison. He was like, oh, God. He started young, and then next thing he's, like, married. He's like, hang on, he's like 12. And then he's had a heart attack. And then, like. But I just thought it was Part of the thing, because I read chapter one and then it did say chapter 12, but I thought, right, it's like that. Sort of done in that stylish way that everyone's doing. What kind of a biography. Whoever that starts messing with the medium. I was born in the East End. Take one onion. Add some. This is the idea that an East End villain's gonna write his autobiography. But think, yeah, I'm just gonna play with the form a bit. I'm gonna get quite postmodern with this. Barely able to write, probably. Well, you could say that about him, Steve. I wouldn't. I think he's an educated man. Go on. Next. Carl. Yeah. Just because it was like two for a tenner, that shouldn't be like, oh, well, you know, you got. You got a good offer, sir. No, that's rare. I'm sure the bloke selling it did not know that the pages are out of order. Let's face it, Carl, you read it and didn't realize. Yeah. So you got almost half the way. Through before you realized. Yeah, but anyway, still, that'll teach you. And that's put you off books for life, hasn't it? Well, I don't. I don't like getting into books now. I just read snippets of information. Play record. Play record. No, I was just going to tell you about a bit of information that was reading. I can't. Well, we play around. No, we've got time for a bit of dribble before we play next year. Well, I'd rather appear a tune and come back for dribble, because I think people are tuning for dribble. So let's tease them. Okay. Let's have a record. Some absolute shites from Carl Bilkington. Excellent. Look forward to that. Longview and further. I love that one on XFM. 104.9 m. Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. All right, Carl, what did you learn? Right, like I said, I don't like reading books. There's too much. Too much work. I'm busy and that. Yeah, I don't like reading books, actually. But go on. So I have done so. Gone. Right. So I was looking in this magazine, right, and it was more about, you know, I'm not that impressed with Einstein and Newton and that lot. No, why should you be? What have I ever done? Go on. No, but, you know, you know, the fact. You see that. The Columbus thing, he's another one in here. You got a bit of praise for finding America. Yeah. And it's like. It would someone else would have come across that at some point. Yeah, Right. And yet news this week, they found two new types of frog. Right? No one's making a fuss and look how small they are compared to what he bumped into. And that's what I'm saying. People make a big deal out of all these people who are finding stuff. Right. Yeah. So the next person. I mean, as my head's buzzing, but I can't be bothered. I actually can't be bothered. Don't think this reaction's a good reaction. I don't know where to start with this drivel, but carry on. All right, so anyway, the next fella. Who? The next fella. See, I don't know you talking riddles. The next fella I'm going to talk about Stein. Yeah, right. Everyone raves about him all the time. Yeah. So I'm trying to get into my head, yeah. Like why is why he's amazing and that. Yeah, right. Okay. So did a bit of reading up on him in this science magazine right? Now I read it. It's only. Only, you know, I don't know, 200 words, whatever, trying to get across what he worked out. But I read it last night. Is it relativity you're talking about? Yeah. Well, to say. Yeah, like, I just made that word up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so the 200 words as far as you recall. So anyway, so I read it and I was like, I don't. I don't know what. What is going on about here? Right? So Suzanne was with me. I said, can you read this? She said, I'm watching Sex and the City. I said, right, but can you read it and explain to me what I don't understand here? This is why I don't understand. It's great. It's like she's thinking, I haven't got kids. Yeah. And yet he still wants me to help with his homework and I'm watching telly. I've been at work. So she said, look, go in the bedroom, read out loud to yourself. Maybe it makes more sense if you read it out loud. Yes. I said, right, I'll go and do that then. It was good because it's cool in there anyway, right? So I went in there. So reading out twice. Went back and I said, I don't get it still. So she said, right, wait 10 minutes and I'll sort out. So I was sat there looking at it, trying to work it out before she had to look at it. I was like, no, I forget this now. What he was saying is, yeah, if you send a man to the moon. Yeah, right, yeah. He was saying to the fella in, in the rocket. Yeah. It would seem like 20 years to him. Yeah. Not the moon, but. Yeah, no, it was. That's what it said. It said the moon. Well, it wouldn't because it's only about. No, but listen, listen. So it took 20. 20 years to the fella, yet people who are on the earth, it would seem like 2000. Yeah. Because. Because time is relative. Not. Not. I don't. What, what do you mean? Right, well, well listen, the fact is that it's tending towards the speed of light where it really makes a difference. They've even done it with atomic clocks where they've sent one up even in Concord. And it's like point, not one of a second difference. What, what is the watch? Yes. Yeah. Because greater speeds. But why does speed affect how a watch works? Right. I don't think speed is. Sorry, Steve. See what I've done? I don't think this is a conversation to be had on a Saturday afternoon on a radio show. I'm just saying though, it's not. It's not me, is it? It is you. You went quiet, Steve. No, because. Having problems. Because I'm not going to explain it to you. I will explain. It's speed equals basically velocity equals turns over time. When velocities doesn't change and nor does distance. Time has to. That's his theory. Yeah. We just go, what's your point? I'm just. I'm just saying. Because you don't understand. It's worthless. I was trying to explain to Newton that basically formulated, you know, the laws of the universe, the three laws, the universe, even playing snooker. I'm trying to drop something. I was going with equal opposite reaction and all these sort of stuff, right? And he was going, what did he do? Apart from the apple on his head with the gravity. And I went, well? What do you mean and he went, well. Why was it a problem? If we would been floating around, I'd have called him in. But since we're not, we don't need him. That's what he said. Play a record, you're a buffoon. So there's these two new kinds of frogs. You're joking. What? A monkey had a hat. The monkey had a voice. I believe in A Thing called Love by the Duck miss on XFM 104.9. Last show, possibly the last ever show. It's up to the Cayman, little pilky baldy pilky little whingy demo Manco. As he's called his Latin name Dimas Mancoid. All right, Carl. All right. You're gonna miss this, aren't you? Nope. Good show, though. Enjoying the last show? Yeah, it's all right. And, you know, I hope it gets better because Telegraph are listening today. The Telegraph? The paper. Why are they. Why do you say that? Just Jenny, the PR woman, said to me yesterday. She said, just, you know, do some good topics and that, so you don't have to worry there. Would you? What? They phoned up to say, hello, it's Ted above here. We'll be listening tomorrow. I don't know. I don't know what they. What they're doing. Are they doing a review of it or something? I don't know. Why would they do that? There's no reason to. I'm a bit. Why didn't you mention this earlier? Telegraph have said. Why would they call up to say we'll be listening? Because they truly said they'll be listening. But also, can you make sure you record it? Because if we can't listen to it because of the pirate stations that are on at the weekend because it affects our signal and stuff, whoever's listening must listen and know there's a problem with pirates. And they said, can you. Well, they're probably just doing a feature about radio shows or something, then they're. Gonna tear us to shreds. They're gonna. I mean, listen to the. Sorry, seriously, the drivel we've talked today. I mean, what are they gonna make of it? That's a broadcast. I think I know what Monday's headline's gonna be. I don't think it's gonna be like, you know, they're gonna forget about the power cuts. It's not gonna be about, you know, the inquiry or terrorism or anything. It's gonna be no more to Knob News. Yeah, it's gonna. They're gonna love. I mean, I seriously, I. I have a little bit of self respect and if I'd known something quality, a quality newspaper was gonna be listening, I wouldn't have turned up today because, I mean, I'm an award winner, you know, and I'm a respected television writer and I've, you know, won awards. Sort of classy. Don't worry, though. What have we talked about? Knobs. We've had the worst quiz on radio. We've had you trying to explain relativity. You didn't even understand what that word meant. I don't think you recognize the word. You read the article. You read the article four times, twice out loud, where you could Hear Sex in the City, Music. Right. And yet you. That. I. I might. That word might have been like a clem, for instance. You hadn't heard it before, so. I don't know. Do you look between the lines? Do you actually look at the words? No. There's too many words, though. The Telegraph are going to love that because there's loads of words. The Telegraph got loads of words. I mean, there's cover with it, words. Which way up? Do you hold the magazine when you read it? No, but there is too many words. I mean, people. Are they upside down? I mean. Yeah, there's too many words. There was too many words in the world. Do you know what this one means? Right. This is one I learned the other day. I think it's antiduan. No. What does that mean? Old. Sorry, how do you spell it? Of course you don't. Antiduan. No, I've never heard that word. It means old. But the annoying thing is it takes longer to say. And it's the fact that if you. Where do you hear that word and in what context? And someone told me about it. I was talking to someone about long words and that, because you mentioned something when we were out drinking and I said to you, why did you say that then? What word does that mean? And then you had to explain it and I said, well, you didn't have to say that. You could have just said, blah, blah. But can I say, Steve, I wasn't sort of trying to cut him out or being pretentious. It must have been just a normal word in my vocabulary that he. You didn't know. Wait a minute. Vocabulary? Pretentious? I think you've lost me. Yeah. I tell you. Scared by syllables. Yeah. It's just. I'll tell you what, though. I was gonna do a feature about this. It's funny you should say I was gonna do a feature. My next feature I'd written down is how good the Telegraph is, the newspaper. Yeah, it's bloody brilliant. I love it because it's informative, it's impartial, it does research. Good. I think it's a lovely layout. The photography is brilliant. Do you know what? I like the bloody font. I love the bloody font. Do you mind something else? I mean, you say it's sort of, you know. I mean, if there's any bias at all. I mean, there isn't, because it's apolitical. But I bloody love the Tory party. I love. Wow. Let's not go into it, but, I mean, I just like to tell you, I just like the journalism and the. Size of the paper. I like the way they're fair. They'd never. They'd never like, you know, slag us off. No, no. But also I think it's because they understand that, you know, we don't really care and so we can't be blamed for anything they hear on the radio. And anything we said that was like, you know, a bit nasty or stupid was. Was probably sort of like some clever, sort of ironic post modern. Yeah. Player record. Yeah. Brilliant. Telegraph. It's really fairly priced, don't you think? I think it's too cheap. I. The occult. There she sounds. Sanctuary on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais with me, Stephen Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Now, if the Telegraph are listening and that, you know, whoever it is, they're writing their article and they're coming up with sort of words like cheap, smutty, low brow. Yeah. In. In our defense, could I just say that we're pandering to our listenership? Yes. You know, I mean, this. This station, I mean, without exception, the people who work here, the executives, the DJs, are alcoholics, drug users, sex offenders. Check the register. You know, we're trying to fit in with that for two hours a week. So we really have to sort of really bring it down. Seriously dumbing down. But if you want, we. Well, we do our normals. Like we talk about, usually. Well, yeah, satire. Social and political satire. Yeah. If you listen any other week, that's what you would have heard. Well, we see var. Sort of like quite, you know, political and, you know. Oh, Proust. I love him. Oh, I wish he. I wish he'd resign as governor of France. Have you read Martin Amos's new novel? I love it. It's all so brilliant. Lovely. Very long. So. Oh, politics, though. I mean, what do you make of politics? Rick? Sorry. I was just planning on going to the English National Opera tonight to see Tartuffe. Yeah, well, politics is brilliant. It's my favourite thing. Say something satirical and comical about, say, John Prescott. Oh, he's got. Stop eating pies. Prescott. I wouldn't like to be him about now. So that's the sort of stuff. What do you think of George W. Bush? He's a bit stupid, isn't he? Well, that's the dangerous thing. He's the most powerful man in the world and I just think. I hope he's sort of. He thinks about stuff he does first. Oh, please, please, please. So that's why comic. I thought something about Bush as well. Go on. But it's. It's about his name and a woman's family. Oh. So I was gonna bring those two. I think it's fine though I don't think that. I think that's still quite high Brown because you've incorporated Bush. Which me the President as well. So I think we're pleasing both. We got both camps Camp. That reminds me of something. I know. Yeah. So that's. So if you're listening. Telegraph. Daily Telegraph. That is brilliant sort of thing. You're brilliant. Too many words for Carl. But what about some adverts? I'd love to buy the Telegraph. Black Rebel Motorcycle club stop on XFM 104.9. Well for Telegraph are listening. They'll be. They'll be loving the music I've been loving. Knob news coming up. Telegraph. Just keep listening because Monkey News is coming up and should we do the results of Rockbusters? The. The worst quiz, the best quiz on radio. Do that shortly. Although probably you're thinking, Rick, isn't it time that we do our usual roundup of what's been happening in the news? Yeah, which we always do every week. Yeah, we always do something which is. I mean basically if you're listening and you're a new listener, say you work at a newspaper. We always try to be informative. Just try and put stuff out there that just educates people. Inform. What are you thinking? Well I said Monkey News is coming up but what have you got? No, I was just looking on the net there. I'm just find a couple of quite important news stories probably worth mentioning. Policeman caught photographing. Huh. I don't know why it makes me laugh. It's just the phrasing I suppose. It's a headline. Policeman caught photographing up woman skirt. Now he wasn't up there taking a picture of Big Ben. He wasn't going. Can I just sit up here? I'm just gonna take a picture of that seagull over there. No, he was facing the camera up a woman's skirt. He was indeed. Right. A policeman in Japan is facing disciplinary measures after he was caught photographing up a woman's skirt with a hidden camera while on duty. The 42 year old sergeant, who's not been named, used a digital camera to secretly snap the shots when the woman was reporting a stolen bicycle. So it was actually. He was actually doing his proper job. He'd obviously thought to himself, I'll bring him a digital camera today on the off chance a beautiful woman comes in to report a crime or Robbery. I'll have it ready. I'll have it positioned, you know. Yeah. In such a way. But this is interesting. This is how he got caught. Okay. The woman became suspicious after she saw a flash go off. Brilliant. I mean, this. Not a secret at all. Sorry, did I just see your shoe? Your shoe just seemed to just bring into life. There was light, there was like. Yeah. I've had some Somerset, fired, some magnesium. But it's only you and I in there. And your shoe was. Yeah. Why is your shoe just sort of like between my feet? There's no reason to show. Just. Just where. What did the bike look like? Flash. Are you taking pictures? And now I'm not. And you should be wearing knickers anyway. Well, how do you know that? What? How did you know I'm not. How did I know what? I'm not wearing any. I didn't know you. I don't know what you've got up there. Well, I don't know what it looks like. And I never. There's no way I could. Of course, that would be. It would be the. Roughly. That conversation in Japanese. I know. Yeah. You know, you just mentioned that about sort of no knickers and that. It's just gonna be your Auntie Nora. No, no, no, no. It's just, you know, like the. The last flat that I lived in, I always had a good view across the road and I could see it was the airy. Airy. There was the hairy Chinese. Not hairy Chinese kid. He was just a Chinese kid, actually. Yeah. Yeah. That's rare in it. Airy Chinese kids. Very rare in it. There's only one official sighting, isn't there, in one of those shit little magazines that you buy. Yeah. He was running around in his underpants. Did you. Sorry. You just swore. Ironically, I mean, I imagine if there's any newspapers, this. You did that. Because you're sort of jokey and. Yeah, go on. That's not. Swear. And there was the old woman who didn't move. She was just sat there reading the. Book, who we think possibly died. And no one came around for weeks. Yeah, but. And now I've moved, right. And it was quiet for a bit. I always look at what view I'm getting, right. Looks across. There was just sort of empty sort of flats ready for people to move in and that. Right. Anyway, people are in there now, right. And they've put all the furniture in, but I haven't put any curtains up. Oh, right. So anyway, I'm. I'm sort of washing up, just having a Having a look out the window. Yeah. Right. Girl sort of wandering about, you know, knickers on. Right. With no knickers. You mean naked? Well, she had a brow on. Right. Okay. She's probably looking for a nick, so I thought. Oh, and I don't know how long I was looking. No. Right. But anyway, she looks across. Oh, God. I think she spotted me. Yeah, I think. Oh, God, I felt really bad. Yeah. I said to Suzanne, sorry, is this. Some sort of peeping Tom confession while the telegraph are listening? I have no idea. Well, you see, he's not. That's the thing, Peepington. If I was peeping, she was peeping as well. Because she was looking over. Works both ways on it. Yeah, but. Yeah, yeah. All she could see of you was your bald head. Yeah. No, no. And your hands moving as you were washing up. And some looking substance. Roughly stubborn stain on this glass. Oh, God, imagine that. Imagine if she looked across. I'm assuming your sink is lower than the window. But, but didn't she just like. Just cover up or something? Or she looked back and go. Oh, you looking at. You looking up a bunny. Well, the thing I did what I thought. Oh, just thought I'd drop me boxer shorts. What? Well. Susanna, what are you doing? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? No, just, just, just so they can see me. Cheeks of me. What are you talking about? No, this. Because I thought if she thinks I am walking about in a nude as well, then we've both got something out of it. Carl, this sounds like. This sounds like a bad excuse in court. I know. This is. Or the plot of a film on Channel 5. I mean, this, this is like the doctor who got done right. For exposing himself to a patient. And set and brought. And then. Then painted that little thing and that you look down their throat. Pink. Yeah. And going and going. This is what they saw. Yeah, yeah. So sorry, you immediately. So you were looking and dancing around naked. Right. So the only thing you could do was immediately drop your boxer shorts. So she looked across, saw you fully clothes before you took your box. She wouldn't have done because it's sort of just the top half and the sink's at a side angle. So I was sort of looking out. So she wouldn't have seen your trousers then, anyway. No, she did. I moved in front of the window. So you then made. Yes, she climbed in front of the window. Oh, this is amazing. So you climbed in front of the window. Oh, to show off. Suzanne said, what are you doing? I think she did what Are you looking at. I sent you in here to clean up. What are you doing? I'm just. I'm just taking my trousers down. Stand out by the window. Why? Because there's a naked woman across the road. What do you think I'm doing, Suzanne? I'm exposing myself while looking at some free food. What's up with you, Susan? Leave it, then. Leave it. Christ. Are we doing Rockbusters? Yeah. She sent you in there to read up on Einstein. She comes in and finds out. Oh, brilliant. Wait a minute. A final question. What did the woman across the way, what happened? What was her reaction? I didn't look again. I just thought, you've seen a bit of action as well. We're both happy. Let's. Let's leave it. So were you waddling around like a penguin with your trousers around your ankle? I just was walking about and Suzanne said, what you doing? I said, I'll explain to you in a bit, but don't look out the window. Because then he sees that she calls her husband to look at car walking naked. He goes, oh, she's got a quick. Suzanne, get them out. There's only one with England. Get some more friends. They've gone. One more anyway. Brilliant. Right, Player record. Come back to Rockbusters and Monkey News. We haven't got enough time. Do Rock Buster. Oh, God Almighty. Hanging round of Transformer, a bit of Lou Reed. Nearly finished. Nearly finished. 12 minutes until we are no more with the vase. Monkey News store to come. Well, yeah. Don't forget that monkey. New still to come, but now the answers to Rockbusters. Right, do the clues. All right, the first clue was this vegetable started its life down under. The initials were K.O. that was Collie Osborne. Right. Collie Osborne. The second one was. No, no, no. What? What, are we letting that go? Yep. We haven't got time, Rick. Well, we just know. It's just not the word. Also, cauliflowers. Don't start there. Don't start Down Under. They're. They're on top. It's not like carrots. No, down under is in Osborne. Osborne. Collie. I thought you meant starting. Her name's not Collie. Right. The second one was the things that you normally find on the beach, right? They've been found floating around the moon. That's the space shells. Right. Specials. This is rubbish. I mean, I tell. No, this isn't even funny, though. I mean, they're no good at all. Cryptic. It's not cryptic. It's wrong. It's not cryptic. The last one was. Well, If. If you put that many in the post, I'm surprised I didn't receive one. Go on. That's FC 50 cents. What? 50 cent is 50 cent. I didn't receive any. So. So Collie Osborne. Collie. Her name's not Collie. Her name is not Collie. Doesn't matter. Well, one. It doesn't matter. Well done to Gina Fairy who has emailed in. She's got all those answers. Right. And just emailing your address and that. Yeah, email that. You're such an idiot, Carl. As are you, Gina. Loosen your hold by south. That's great. On XFM 104.9. Well, that's nearly it, Rick. Can I just say thanks to everyone who's emailed in over the weeks and months we've been on, because obviously we're too lazy to even send them a response or reply. But we do appreciate. We do appreciate it. Saying all the letters and stuff that we, you know, we can't. Yeah, people send stuff in all the time and they say they like the show or they don't, or they contribute little ideas and stuff, and we do read them and we do appreciate it. It's just that we. When you've got someone like Carl Pilkington in the studio, you just need to pick his brain constantly and you've got no real time for admin. But thank you for sending in all the nice letters and responses. Well, finally, we should let people know that next week, for the foreseeable future, it's Adam and Joe. Brilliant. Brilliant. And they're standing in for us this time next week. Well, you say standing in, but possibly replacing full time. Unless Carl Layton decides to change his mind and come back. What do you think, Carl? You enjoyed today's show. I know, yeah. It's been all right. Yeah. He attempted to come back when we. When we finally return. Maybe a little rest to make you sort of like, forget how annoying I am. That is my secret weapon sometimes, you know, because it's the thing that you can. You can fleece a sheep as many times as you want, but you can only skin it once. So what I do is sort of like, I never actually completely lose a friend. I tease them and talk to them to the point where they're gonna leave me. And I go, oh, anyway, how you doing? I go, I'll sort of confuse them. Yeah. And that's what I've done with you today. And I think over the next couple of months where I'm sort of nicer on the phone, I'm not squeezing Your head. You'll go, he's all right, Rick. And then I'll get you back in it. And then I absolutely rip you to pieces again. I'll be dealing with. So. But hopefully. And also, unlike a lot of my friends who are clever, I don't have to worry about you because you will forget. I mean, because you've got such a. You've got a tiny little intellect. Do you know what I mean? You'll forget this conversation even took place. Anyway, it's what everyone's been waiting for. It's what Carl exists for. For the last time. It's the. It's monkey news. Oh, chimpanzee that. Monkey news. Right. Are you familiar with under monkey? Keep talking. Undreth. Monkey under. Yeah. Like as in like one more than. Ninety nine hundredth, one hundredth monkey. Yeah. Are you familiar with that? No. No. Anyway, thanks. That was next week, Adam and J. What do you mean? I'm going to leave that. Well, I thought it was a popular phrase or something. What? Hundredth monkey? Yeah. What do you mean a popular what? What? Why? What? Cuz you're going to do songs and phrase with it next week. We've said it was before. Hundredth monkey. No, it's just. It says the expression hundredth monkey. We do. Anyway, what's the story? Well, it's from the 1950s, right. And the way they got it, because they were following some monkeys about, right. And decided who was. Who was monkeys? Journalists. Oh yeah. Why? Oh, yeah? Just to see what. What they're up to. Okay, so they're following some monkeys around. Yeah. What was it? What, a documentary? Anyway, one of them. Come on, come on. One of them washed some potatoes. Right? Okay. Right, let's leave. All right, let's leave. Let's leave. Come on. A monkey washing potatoes. Can we leave that one? You've got to do it now they're following it. What is. Was just one chimp and it was washing a potato and they thought that's a bit odd. Right? Yeah. Okay. It turns out that that ended up teaching another monkey. Yeah. How to wash a potato. No, they do it. They do. They go down and wash them in the sea because they like the taste of salt. And the weird thing is though, when it got to the hundredth monkey, right, even though it hadn't been taught how to wash a potato. Yeah. It automatically knew. It knew what to do. What do you mean? It was in them. It was in them that they knew that when they get a potato they had to wash it. That isn't the monkey news. I'm just. I'm just saying that's where the expression come from. But you only heard of that, so. Well, there's a couple of things there that. It could be another upshot. And, you know, an instinct is part of your genetics. Anything else, but you can't pass on acquired characteristics, so that's nonsense. If you mean that, that someone was taught they had a child and it knew it, there's no. There's no chemical memory as such. No, the. The monkey news, you know, we've covered a lot of stuff. There was sad, sad stuff, weren't they? Yeah, there's some funny stuff in there, you know. Yeah, do monkey news. Football team. A monkey football team? Yeah, in Costa Rica. Oh, yeah. Got all the. Got all the team members here. Right. All the different things. Little goalkeeper. Apparently he's on transfers from some other club. But the bit that got me attention is apparently he's a holder of PhD of physics. Do you want to have a look at that or. The goalkeeper? Yeah, just the goalkeeper. The others haven't done that much. The others haven't done that much. Well, I believe that he's got better exam results than you, Carl, but I don't believe he's got a PhD in physics, obviously. Do you know what the name of the team is? Coconuts. So if the Telegraph are listening, that is the sort of quality entertainment you get. Well, you don't anymore. Let's just put a song on there. Yeah, that's the end. Goodbye, everybody. Have a lovely summer. Yeah, the rest of it. And we might see you in October. We might not. It's up to Carl Pilkington, chances are. So call 02077 double six, six thousand, ask for Carl Pilkington or email him. What's this? This is Tim Buckley. To end with. I think you'll enjoy this. It's called Once Highways. Call Andrew Phillips, see? Yeah.",
