Well, we've got some great tunes lined up, haven't we? We've got Eminem, we've got. We've got Coldplay, Oasis, we've got Della Soul, Chemical Brothers, Dr. Dre, Garbage, REM, the Manix, we got Muse, we got Feeder, we got some classic. I mean, you said all those names, Rick, but the chances of us actually playing all of those are quite slow. We might not get to them if we talk too much. And obviously we'll obviously drop a couple of those to play our own tracks as well. Yeah, well, they are on tracks. Yeah, well, well, I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna get into that now. Right, here's Eminem. Eminem, the real Slim Shady. Now, even though that sort of record is. Is, you know, relatively recent and it's, you know, it's quite hardcore, what's going on about, you know, subject matter that is. That is adult really. Certainly. And it's quite aggressive and it's cool. But he still managed to make it sound like a novelty record. It is, yeah. I mean, it's like a little thing. I know that's the intention and that's good, but I mean, I think, I think it's nice that he's got a nice little tune. It could be like a little cartoon figure. Here comes Flumpy mcm. But the only is there is. Isn't there like a video you can get now which is a cartoon? Slim Shady, the Adventures of Slim Shady. Really? Cuz I know there was the Adventures of MC Hammer, the cartoon animated series, which sadly I never got to see, and New Kids on the Block. I think the cartoon went a bit mad and started, you know, spending a lot. Yeah, exactly. You know, MC Hammer now, apparently he's like. He tours on the kind of religious music scene. Does he? Yeah, he's gone. Wasn't he always a preacher or something or started in gospel or something? Yeah, I think so. Because he used to. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I just assumed he was quite off the streets. He used to keep a lot of Bibles in his big trousers. Yeah. So he could go around giving it to poor people. Yeah. Well, apart from the great music we got lined up, Steve, we've got obviously our regular features. We've got my classic film review. Always looking forward to it. That's Already getting a little bit of, you know, attention. From whom? Wow. Just various people. Go on. Name some. Wow. Can't name them by name or just. Yeah. Oh, God, what's that one? Oh, scores. Easy. Right? One of those films. Okay, good. Yeah. You're gonna talk about one of his today. Yeah. Well, no, Spielberg. Right. Gonna do a Spielberg film. Okay, we've got that film. Sounds good. Yeah. Now that's not my film review. That's where I take a. A track off a soundtrack of a classic film. Yes. And it's a great track. And I go, oh, that film sounds good. Br. So, yeah, because it sounds good. You see what I mean? Don't, please don't be confused and think that that's the film review. I hate people. Yeah, yeah. We've got a song for the lovers. We've got a song for the ladies. Yeah. I'm gonna be playing a hip hop track. It's called the Class. It's called the hip hop track. It's called Steve says hip hop. Hooray. Oh, it's just brilliant. If there's anyone listening like, you know, Saatchi and Saatchi or Mechanics and you know those people that do advertising, then we are the people. We're the people. We can, we can market, we'll mark anything. And maybe you're a two bit band, want to email in or something, you know, just say, how can we publicize our music? Yeah. I mean if we were marketing, say a band, we wouldn't say, this is a two bit band. No, that'd be wrong. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'd say this is a brilliant band. They're going, excellent. I like it. It's always the same reviews. They, it's sort of like they go, the excellent single by Coldplay, Yellow because. Oh, yellow. That's yellow. Why they do the bit that says yellow? We said it just to show. I want to see something else in the song. Maybe, maybe the midlight. Yeah. It would be the new, the brand new excellent album from Travis featuring the hit single Sing Sing Sing Sing. That's a brand new album from Travis. It features 12 other new tracks and Sing Sing Sing. Brilliant. Well done. I'd buy it. No, I would. That's about. That's all the features we've got in it. That's all the stuff we lined up. We were probably going to, I don't know, probably rapid rabbit on about other stuff. Carl, unless I'm very much mistaken, we've got something to give away. Is that right? The K man's with us of Course. Pressing the button. Kp. You all right, mate? Yeah. Pilkington. I'll just say there's nothing funny about that name straight away. Seriously. Let's just clear that up straight away. You know, the idea that people are laughing so in school they'd go through the register. Anderson. Go through Camfield. Sturgis. Sturgis. Well, no, it wouldn't go to Sturgis yet, would it? Oh, she wouldn't be there, would she? Well, no P's before S, isn't it? She just wouldn't be at school. She's busy in rehab. Pilkington. Okay, settle down. There's nothing funny about Pilkington. What's up with it? It's Pilkington. Pilkinton. Yeah. Sounds a bit like Plonker. Yeah. Or Pilchard. Yeah. So anyway, we've got tickets. I don't think anyone's ever mopped the name before. I think we're the first ones to do it. Oh, we're brilliant, we are. I don't think people up north figured that out, that it was a funny name. Well, it probably isn't up there, is it? Because they've all got names like Ramsbottom Wilkinson, Pilkington. Piddle. Trent, Hyde, Oscar Piddle. Trend Hide. What are you doing? You're late. Anyway. Gervais. Well, that's an exotic name. He pays your wages. Blimey, here he comes having a go at the star of the show. Yeah. Do you want to play a record and get back to it? We got tickets to give away. That's what we're saying. Carl. What's the tickets? People want to know what the tickets. Are after this record. Clever. Shinobi versus Dragon Ninja. That's what I like about sort of rock and roll. Just, you know, sings, tells a story about everyday things. You know about Shinobi versus Dragon. Was there any reference to shinobi or the Dragon Ninja in the song? I wasn't listening. I wasn't really paying attention. But I'm assuming that some of that screaming was about Shinobi in the drag. I don't know who won. If anyone knows who won out of the Shinobi and the Dragon Ninja. Oh, maybe it's. Maybe it's like a trilogy. Maybe they sort of get together in one. Then the second single, there's the fight, right. The mid thing in the film. So I don't know about film structure because I do a film review. Yeah, sure, sure. And then the final one is, you know, the. The other two of them pairing up against maybe a larger Villain Godzilla type. That's. That's interesting. I don't know. I mean, who knows? Who knows? Okay, well they do lost profits. I'm written it yet. Are the lost profits English? Are they British? What's the deal? Who are the prophets? Pilkes? Who's the profs? Pilkey? Yeah, I think they are, yeah. What. What was the answer? What was that? Are they English or American? I'd say they're American. Just having a guess. Why didn't you say? I don't know. Still trying to fool us. KP again. Trying to deceive us. Kp. You were going to tell us, Pilkey. You were going to tell us, Pilchard. You were going to tell us what. What tickets are you weighing? But it worked for me, see, because when I was younger, a mobile disco. Brilliant. So did I. And it was me and my mate Colin making. And the disco is called Pilk Is Making Music. That's brilliant. I mean that genuinely brilliant. Pilk is Making Music. Guess what? When I first started the mobile disco, this was when I was about 14, we just. We didn't really go at touring. We just would do it for like people's parties and stuff. We were called the rock and roll DJs. No, really, we drew it on some. On some sort of see through paper and put a light behind it. Rock and roll. My first disco, I had two nights a week in this pub. You run a disc. Yeah, this pub near King's Cross. Right. And it was just their records, Right. And every. I had to play this, this number of songs every time the same time. So all the locals all drunk with dancing and everything. One of them was American pie by Don McLean. Right. And they just sing along, all the. Words, sort of drunk, about seven minutes long. Yeah, yeah. The other one was Baby Jane by Rod Stewart. If I didn't play that, I'd get lynched. And what was the other one there was that I always had to play? It was a. It was a ballad, I have to remember that. But. Yeah, but so Carl, do you think maybe Ricky as well. Do you think you know much about DJing for like you know, the sort of the wedding party or maybe someone's 18th. Oh really? Okay, let me just offer a little hypothesis for you then. All right? The buffet's been served, right. People have done some speeches like it's a wedding do. Yeah. So you've already played some records early on, you've stopped for food, you just played some light backing music in the background while the food's been Served. You want to get the party rocking again. What do you kick off with? It depends. It depends. I've already got it down to two or three records. Okay. I'd like to hear what they are. Well, I've got it down to Earth, Wind and Fire. Right. That'd be great. You know, if there's, you know, depending on or you want to go a bit more than. I'd. I'd probably start off with a Will Smith. Well, careful, Rick. I've got to bear in mind it is a wedding due, so there's people from age 8 to 80. You got cake in every market. Okay. Kyle, what about you? See, this was back in 88, so. Yeah. Kylie depend. Yeah, yeah. Can I tell you what the definitive track is? Go on. Oh, what a Night. Frankie Valley in the Four Seasons. People don't realize what it is exactly. It's straight away. I can't actually play it, but. Oh, what a night. Late December, back in 60s. That leads you straight into a seven. It's medley and everyone's loving that. I'm thinking Bee Gees. There's going to probably be some kind of abbatrack. Dancing queen, Organized storm. I. What? You're. You're turning your noses up. I can tell you this, that we got bookings, endless people going, you're amazing. I don't know how you do it. I wouldn't have got up. I would have sat there. Well, you might be, because you're one of those grouchy. One of those moody teenagers. Oh, I'm not going to dance to this. I'll tell you, the old ladies would have been up. The people with a decent, decent bit of musical taste would be up. No, the first person to get up is a fat lady in a dress with bad ankles and a little. A little kid who's got problems and he's in a little dj. See, the problem with you two is you're not catering to the market. You're trying to be all sort of bohemian and kind of off. Off. You know, teach people about music and stuff. There's no place for Kylie. Not a mobile disco. Far too avant garde. All right, Kick it in. Grease. Megamix Play. Got a Play record. Come on, Eileen, have you got Common? Eileen, play that. We're gonna play Love Shack. Coldplay. Excellent. Yellow. It's the excellent single by Coldplay. It's Yellow. Oh, Yellow. That's Yellow by Coldplay. That was the stunning new single from Coldplay. Yellow all the way back to 1999. When was it? 2000. No, 99. Was it? No. Was it? I'll count that. I didn't realize so many people were fans of the lost profits. Everyone's been phoning in, emailing in telling us they were from Cardiff. Yeah. Welshman. Now are you going to tell us what tickets you've got? Carl? What? What have we got to give away tickets for now? We kept the secret. We said no, tell us on air. So it's a big surprise. This is going to be if it's going to be really rubbish. Is it? This is. This, this, whatever these tickets are. Right. Is a testament to how much they rate us here, xfm. How much they rate our show and care about us. What tickets have we got to give away? A top show featuring Mickey Gervais and Steve Merchant and Pilkington. What tickets have we got to give away? Tickets for K Fest. Right, Go on. What's that? It's like a rock thing that's going on tonight. You know, if you're into that Welsh. Name some of the bands name some events. Nile. Go on. Right. That's one of the bigger ones. Mark Lanigan. Not Lanners. Is Lana's a plane. He's not really Mark Lanigan. Really playing there? I think so. God, who's that? What? Who's that? Who is Lanigan? Is he someone you went to school with? Who is Mark Lanigan? Who else is Mark Lanigan? Is he the promoter? He's just in a pub in Camden. He got. He got. You got nine. We're giving away to get to the Cave Fest. Hold on, let's have a look. I says this is the enemy. Mark. Mark Lanigan. Masters of reality. Right, okay. Who else? We got Nile. We got Mark Lanigan. Nile. Who else? I can't pronounce this one. Oh, let's have a look. That's good or something. Bethlehem. Behemoth. Behemoth. Behemoth. Is it? Let me see. No one can read. I expected from a northerner, but not from a university educated man like you. Oh, yeah. Let me have a look. Where are we now? I can't even find on the page. Here we are. Yeah. Anyway. Behemoth. Yeah, Behemoth. I just thought something. We're not really giving those away, are we? Surely we're asking some sort of financial reward for them. Right? Okay. Right. Is there a competition? Let's just. South Carolina Death Mettlers. Nile. Okay, all right. Okay. Yeah. We got. I've got. We got a pair of tickets to give away. Yep. Okay. If you want to go to K Fest, it's the Mean Fiddler Charing Cross Road. And that's tonight, is it? Tickets would be 750, but we're giving away for free. Why don't we say we're giving away for a fiver? That's still a saving. But I'll tell you what can. If you can call in. What's the number? Oh, oh, eight. 700. 800 123. Yeah. And if the question is. Because they're quite sought after, there's big names here like Nile and. And that. What's his name? Lanigan. Lanigan's on. The question is who wants to go? Yeah. So if you can call an answer to that question, who wants to go to that, then you could be one of the lucky winners. Right after this, some great chat and music. Could you also explain who Mark Lanigan is? De La Soul. Watch out. Well, we're wrong. The lines went mental. It's amazing, isn't it? So that they. And they knew all about them, where they were from, what they were like, and the tickets. Death metal is just something that. It's obviously passed me by, but it's obviously huge. It is huge. It's sort of huge. Without being sort of in the public eye. Was. I think it's probably the. The only real alternative out there now, isn't it? Because everything else is sort of mainstream. There's no real alternative music. Even hip hop. Yeah, well, slipknot kind of have snuck in, haven't they, because they went through number one or something. Yeah, yeah. Incredible. It still gets people saying, you know, son of mine. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. We're probably not. Probably a door or something. I can't remember. You can't. People who phone up about the. The heavy metal, though, they always sound such nice people. Yeah, women always sound attractive. You know, if you meet them, though, they're like eight foot tall. We suddenly sound like two old ladies on the bus. And you know what? I spoke to one of them rappers. He was as pie. Help with the shopping and everything. I thought he was gonna kill me. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I am. I am 27 years old now, Rick. 28, according to Carl. Yeah. Talking to my birthday, you know, we did it. It was my birthday a couple of weeks back. Yeah. And we were talking about the stuff that my dad had given me, his presence in the past. And anyway, my sister told me that he'd listened to some of it and the car driven up and he was quite upset and he had missed. Oh, really? Yeah, yeah. But. Yeah, but it was all. It was all affection. It was done with affection. But it was like we were slagging off his gifts, which were awful. I know. Yeah. He's probably listening again. Well, possibly. Oh, I remember telling a story on. On xfm and I'll tell you the story. You've heard it. But I'll tell you what it was. I used to live in just a little one room sort of bed, sit with my girlfriend sort of in there. It was sort of like 80s or. And it was. It was just awful. It was one room and we had a bed and it's sort of like the kitchen was the bedroom, so I. Bed. Literally. The kitchen was your bedroom? Yeah, it was the bed in there. And then like a. Like a. It was just one room. We had. That's all we could afford. Yeah. And so we had. Yeah. And so you know that you're sleeping in bed, your head was by the fridge and the. The sink was by your feet and you had to go out and down the stairs to a communal toilet. So I. Obviously, I'm a man, I could just pop out of bed on tiptoes. The sink was quite high and have a little wee in the middle of the night. So that's fine. Into the. Into the sink, not the fridge, into the sink. Yeah, so that, that was. That was fine. And sometimes I just hear Jane go, oh, at least run the tap afterwards. And I'll go, all right. And I just remember once going, at least take the dishes out first. Because I used to sort of lift. If it was just for the dishes, I used to lift them up and sort of like aim underneath it. And then it was. It was. It was quite hygienic. It was, you know. Right, but what do you mean it was quite hygienic? I was tired and drunk and. Yeah, and it was. It was just a. Oh, it was a horrible place. And we had mice. You urinate quite a lot, don't you? You're quite a. You have a problem with urination after lot. Well, I worry about getting caught like on a tube. I have to. Oh, go, you know. Oh, I don't take tubes anymore. Well, I listen to my dad's advice is never pass a toilet and not use it because you never know when you might have to use one again. Exactly. My next few. One. Oh, but anyway, sorry, what I was going to say was Jane's mum was listening and they said, oh, Ricky St. So the story about Wing in the sink is you. No, he makes an awful lot up. He makes an awful lot up. Yeah. That's what we have to say. No, I was joking and I didn't mean it. So, you know, I think I got away with it. Although her mum did watch me every time I went out to the kitchen when I was at her house. You're like, yeah, just go to. Do you want to call me for sandwich? No. If so, just. I'll have it on the toilet. I know the toilet's over there. Okay. All right. Yeah. Oasis, Don't Look Back and Angular. Classic there. Absolutely. From the. From the. The height of Brit. My God, it's mad to think it's a classic now. And I was there at the beginning. I know. I can't believe it. By the way, urinating isn't bad. It's a good thing. It's getting, you know. No, obviously it's good. I'm not saying the urination is a bad thing. I wasn't damning the fact that you needed to urinate. It was like you were doing it in the sink with dishes. You probably. But, you know, the thing is, in them, you know, there are. There are some societies where if you urinate on something, you sort of own that. That thing. What society is cats, for example. Cats. So, I mean, you know, cats are, you know, enigmatic creatures, aren't they? Mysterious creatures. I mean, so if I, you know, I sometimes, I mean, I own a lot of things through that. Right. Saying telephone boxes. Yeah. You know, lots of fences. My shoes. Your shoes once. Yeah. When I was chasing you around Robin's shoes once. You'd be all right around Jellyfish, because apparently. Is this a band that's playing tonight? It is a band, isn't it? Actually, it was. I think we're on a cave fest. Yeah. If you get stung by a jellyfish. Yeah. We stops hurting. Is that true? Just for anyone listening, I mean, it's probably best to check that maybe on the Internet or phone a doctor before you try that. I mean, because although Carl has got a lot of useful information, he's not a medically trained man. Yeah. Because I got in trouble once coming out of the sea at Bogner, running around, people going, wheel me, please, Please, we on me. Just running around. Yeah, but have you ever wet the bed? I honestly haven't. I've never. Never wet the bed. Never. Never. Okay, let's play a record, then. Are we doing a bit of. Are you. You've wet the bed, have you? Wow. Not. Not as. Not gone as such. Well, you may as well tell us. Well, yes, then. Well, is there a story attached? Well, I remember once. Right. Well, you just. When you Were a child sort of. How old? 26. Okay. And. Oh God. Oh, it's another story involving. Anyway. Right. Once just wasn't a sink handle. Oh God. Come on, Javiz. Well, once I went to stay. Went down to. To Brighton says with Jane for a party, her sister's party and we're staying at parents house. Her parents were away and first of all I got too drunk. I didn't. I don't think I'd known him very long. And I remember it was a fancy party and I didn't go as fancy as. But I remember laying on the floor trying to trip people over because I was so drunk. Something that's hilarious if you're drunk. Yeah. Imagine Jane going oh that's my boyfriend. I'm so proud to all her family. And then. And then we've got a cab. I've got a cab. Journey home to that I didn't remember. And apparently the camera going, is he all right? Because I was going be sick. I be sick. D Fine. Then I laid on the bathroom floor and Jane timed it. It was 45 minutes, me singing right by your side by the Arrhythmics. And then I went to bed and apparently I got up in the middle of the night, walked around the bed and just thought the bed was a toilet. And Jane said, Ricky, I went, what? You're pissing on me. I went, well, don't need to wake me up. And then just got back to bed. You urinated on the movie. All right, let's. Yeah. Bit of hip hop. Oh, man alive. Hip hop. Hooray. Hip hop Hooray. Oh. It's the opportunity where Ricky Steve gets to play one of his classic hip hop tracks. Something maybe you've not heard before, Rick. Can I just say I actually slightly regret telling a story about me weeing. Yeah, well, it doesn't stop there. I'm sure there's more. I'm sure you've told me more in the past. All right, just go with the hip hop track. This is from. I need to just introduce it briefly. It's from an artist called Mad Skills who on this record claims that he has written loads of other people's songs, which I think is true. The only thing I would say is that the names of the artist he's supposedly written for have been bleeped out. But of course, because it's also a radio friendly version, all the swearing's been bleeped out as well. So there's a lot of bleeping. But if you can piece it together from It. It will actually be quite a good song. Go on. I'm gonna actually. No, don't. You don't own it by urinating on it. Yeah, I am. No, you. Yeah, put it away. Just a little drivel that is mine now. That cost me over five quid. Gorillaz, rock the house and XFM 104.92 o'clock. Halfway through already. Ricky Gervais show with Steve Merchant. Yeah. Telling really quite embarrassing things that I wish I didn't know. It makes me look like some sort of mad old urinator. You just can't handle your drink. You can't handle your drink. No, I can, I can. I just get rid of it in the usual way of excretion, via the kidneys, down the urethra, out the end, down the sink. Sometimes I think sometimes a toilet coal, sometimes a bed. Yes. Or your girlfriend. You know, it just embarrassing things. I remember once, right, I was. I used to love nature when I was about 8, 9, 10. And I remember going out with my sister and my brother and their girlfriend and boyfriend like to become their husband and wife. Thanks for that. Yeah, you know, just. Just keeping continuity there. And I used to get shells and things around the beach and I used to get anything I love. And I've once. I found. I love reptiles. Well. And I found this perfect snake skin, like a grass snake or an adder. And it was. I. I absolutely. I couldn't believe my luck. And I was going, look. And they were going, okay, put it down. Because. And I realized they were a little bit scared of it. They're going, put it down, it's dirty. And of course I torture them a little bit. And then I thought this was hilarious and they made me leave it there and I told. Told mum and everything. And then much later, when I had some friends, when I was about 14 or 15, I was telling this story to embarrass my sister and I was going, yeah. And she was scared of it. And she went, well, it was a used Johnny. She'd waited that long to embarrass me from my friends. I've been running around with a used Durex thinking that this is great because they were scared of snakes. And they were going, put it down, it's dirty. No, be careful of the poison. Oh, yeah, that's horrible. It is horrible, isn't it? Have I gone too far again? How could you not realise it was made of rubber, for goodness sake? Well, you obviously didn't know anything about nature. Well, I used to love nature, me. Yeah. The difference between us. Now, be careful of the johnny snake. Yeah. Their little poppy head and their poison that. Oh, dear. I was wondering. There was this kid who lived near me once and this bird got run over and he rushed, he said, I can save it. And he kissed it because he thought he could give it a kiss. He thought he could give it the kiss of life. I thought you meant it was a girl. No, no, no. And he kissed it, he thought he could give it the kiss of life, but he didn't know what the kiss of life was. He just thought you could kiss something and that was bringing back to life. I think it was an excuse. I think kissing it. I can't wait for a bird to get run over. Then I can pretend to be giving it a kiss of life, but really I'm giving it a nice little snug on the floor. I really kissed it like that and threw it up like it would fly, like it would fly away. And it just, like, onto the floor. Oh, was it dead or. Yeah, it was blood. Everything was horrible. Oh, no. Yeah. And that. What is he doing now? He presents Animal Hospital. No, I don't know what he's doing. He's the worst vet in the world. Got struck off sleeping with one of his patients. Oh, that's terrible. Oh, bless him. Just. Oh, no. I killed a fish once. Go on. Well, I made a little bow and arrow. I was about 8 or 9, and I made a bow and arrow. And, you know, you never think. We had a pond and there was a huge fish in it, about, you know, 8 inches long. A huge, big, sort of like golden or for some. Or a carp or something. And then I was sort of playing and I aimed and I shot it and it went straight through it and floated to the top. And I thought, oh, my God, you. Pierced a fish with an arrow. That's an amazing shot. Well, it was luck. It was pure luck. I never got an American. Yeah, yeah. And you know those little things outside in the front garden where the front gate, a little sort of 4 inches by 4 inches. Bit about, you lift it up. But it's not like where the drains are if the. You know, the plumbers need to get there, or the council, everything. Right, right. I dropped it down there and I thought, oh, my God, what if that's discovered? What if after a drain. So I ran loads and loads of journeys in and out of my house, right to the toilet and back, just taking out handfuls of vim and pouring bleach down, thinking that I can get rid of this Fish before the council, dig it up in 10 years time and go send him to jail. Yes, fish aside, but who do you think, what do you think they would have done? They'd have taken the dead fish. They've gone to each of the doors going, does it. Is this your fish? Yeah, but I was 8. You don't think you recognized either the. Arrow or the fish? Yeah, there's arrow straight through it. But you know, you don't think when you're eight that it'd be okay if I. If I can ride this out till I'm 20? Yeah. The statute of limitations on goldfish, you know, it's about. I can't work it out. 12 years. Wow. Yes, that was. Carl. Anything embarrassing ever happened to you ever? With what? With animals and stuff. I like animals, to be honest. So do I. It was a mistake. No, you know, I thought you were feeling bad about the fish. Yeah, More worried about you being locked up. Well, I felt bad. There was, there was. There's both the law and the moral side of fish death. I mean, we kill fish all the time, just not usually with a bow and arrow. In a back garden in Whitley, you know, often the supermarket can lend a hand with that. I used to sell mackerel. Did you? Yeah, had a pet magpie. Did you? Called Maggie magpie. You mean you captured it and didn't let it go away? Yeah, kind of a pet, man. But then it got really vicious. I mean, it let me go. What'd you keep it in, a rabbit arch? No, it flew around. But it used to just like to me all the time. But then it's like pecking me head and stuff. That's not a pet magpie, that's a bird in the garden. No, no, but I could actually. I could hold it and stuff. It wasn't scared of me and it knew it was me. It used to come down from like the. The top. It hated you. That's why I wanted to peck you. Is that. Oh, the other thing. I always remember being younger and like walking. Walking through the woods to school with my mum and I was chasing a butterfly and she said. She said, oh, don't do that, Carl. I said, why? Because they only live a day. I said, all right, I'll get a dead one in the morning. That's genius. That's great. That's quick thinking, isn't it? Oh, no, that's sweet. Let's play. Oh, Wu Tang Clan and Gravel Pit. We love that, don't we? I love it. Yeah. Yeah. We're talking about Embarrassing stories and stuff. And I don't know if I've told this on this radio before. Have I told you, Kyle? I'm not sure, but this was when I was working at the BBC. This is not even long ago. And I'd moved to London and I was fairly new in London and I was working the BBC and I had this BBC hire car and I've never told that. If there's anyone listening who works for BBC, I don't know if I can still get in trouble for it. But this BBC hire car, and it was like, I've been ferrying kind of actors and people and production people around all day in this car. And I was driving back, it was quite late, seven or eight, and I was driving back and I pulled in to get some petroleum to fill up the car every day. And I went into this garage to fill up some petrol and I was there and these blokes, two blokes came in in a white van, right? They pulled into the forecourt and I was filling out the car and they went, he, do you want to buy a couple of speakers? And I said, yes, I do. Yeah. Because I'll tell you the reason. It was like, I was so flattered that they thought I'd be the kind of bloke who would, A, need some kind of classy speakers and B, would like to buy them on the slide. You know what I mean? Yeah. I thought, yeah, they like the fact. Seen I look a bit of a hustler. Exactly, yeah, yeah. I'm a street sort of guy. You can see by the way I use my walk. Exactly. So they. So I couldn't believe my luck. So they drove behind the garage, the little sort of garage bit at the back. And I went around there, sort of casually went around there, sort of locked the car, went around there. He went, yeah, he opened the back, he had two speakers in there. I said, are you sure these aren't knocked off, mate? He went, no, no, we work for Dixon's. This is the story you spun me. We work for Dixon's, right? And we're delivery men. And if we make a delivery and the person's not there to sign for the goods, then we have to bring them back to the warehouse. But if we can sell them on the way back, then that's really good for Dixon. Yeah, Dixon's must love that. And instead of thinking, are you sure some kind of troubleshooter didn't. I mean, did someone go into Dixon's and go, yeah, you're not getting in the Garage. Exactly. Get a couple of lads in a white van. Exactly, yeah. So anyway, so I sort of bought this story and I was a little bit dubious and I went, right, let me hear them. Then he wired him up to the car stereo. Explains it. It was some groovy hip hop. I was thinking, great, these guys know what I'm into. And he's giving me the talk and stuff. And I said, I'm a bit worried. These are. These are knocked off. He went, no, listen, we got a bloke at Dixon's who can confirm this is fine, right? Phone him up, use my mobile, right? And quote this reference number, right? So I found out and I goes, yeah. I go, hi. Some guys here in a garage foreclose trying to sell me some speakers. Just wanted to check. He went, it's fine. I went, should I. Should I just read the reference number or whatever? He went, if you want. And X14. I'm like, yes, fine. Yeah, okay. You know what that was, don't you? That was actually Mr. Dixon himself. Yeah. So I'm thinking, well, you know, they sound great. They've given me, for a knockdown price, I'd say they were like 400 quid. They were like 200 quid or something. It was good bargain. I was in the market for some speakers as well. So while they were loading them, it's all kosher. I phoned Dixon. Exactly. I phoned Dixon. That's fine. So while they're loading them in the back of the BBC hire car, right, I'm in there paying for the petrol, right? And the guy serving goes, hey. He goes, what were you doing around the back with those blokes, right? Because obviously there's security cameras filming this whole transaction, right? And he goes, what are you doing around the back? And I went, brilliantly. I went, there's some old mates, some of my mates were just having a chat and that. He went, oh, right. Okay. Like, give me obviously, the evil eye. So I went back. So I'm in the car now and I'm driving with one of the blokes who's in the van with me because I didn't have the money on me, so I had to go to the cash point to get the cash, right? So I'm driving with him and the other guy's like following me in the van. And he was like a northerner and he was giving it all the all right, yeah. You know, I tell my girlfriend's a dj, she's got some of these speakers, they're fantastic. And he's giving me this. And then my mind starts working. Now that I've got a bit of time to think, I'm thinking, wait a minute, this all sounds a bit dodgy. Yeah. It dawned on me, Rick, you know. Fall, you're street wise. You're street wise, Steve. Not only that, I was thinking, how am I going to get them home? I got to drop the car off at the BBC. How am I going to get these huge speakers back to where I live? And how can I pay for them because I've just spent £100 on find the Lady. It seemed like a fair game, some of his friends were winning. But so I explained to him, I said how I can't get him back to like, Brixton, where I was living at the time. He went, don't worry, give us an extra 20 quid, we'll take them home for you. Oh, that's good delivery. They do a whole service and there's also a backup guarantee. Did they have the guarantee, the three month guarantee? No, but. So then. So I said, I'm not sure about that. He went, well, why don't you put them in a cab, send them back and your housemates can collect it. I was, oh, no, it'd be no one in. And I was getting. And I was beginning to sort of get a bit conscious of like, maybe this was a bit of a scam after all. So I pulled into like a little side road. I said, I'm not sure I'm into this now actually. He went, what are you talking about? It's 200 quid for a Paris speakers. It's a bargain. You never get a bargain like this, mate. I'm going, not too sure, actually, I don't think I want him. He went, 150 quid. 150 quid, mate. 150 quid. I went, no, he's 100 quid. 100 quid. Now I'm thinking, wait a minute, this doesn't sound like the kind of work that Dixon's would be doing. Dixons don't do that. When I go in, Dixons never negotiate in that way. When I go look around and I leave, they go, where you going? We'll have anything then. Have anything for a car. So I stopped the car and the white van pulled up behind me with his mates in and I said, can you get him out, I'm not interested. And he went, 100 quid, mate. And he was just going, you toss her, you obviously want some speakers. And he was having a go at me. So I was carrying the speakers out and putting them back in the white van. And he was just shouting at me because he was going, 70 quid. 70 quid. 70 quid from 200. This is ludicrous. You realize that wasn't Dixon's policy then? Exactly. They don't usually shout. You toss her as you leave them. As you leave the shop and walk. Down Camden High Street. You should have took the offer of, like, the monthly payments they've got. So. So eventually I put him in there, and I sort of knocked the deal on the head, and I got back in my car, and they got. They were in theirs, and I just looked in the rearview mirror and they were punching the dashboard, like, with aggression and venom. Like we let that deal slip through our fingers. And I've never been so terrified in my life. I just sat there and I was just thinking, oh, my God. All I was thinking now is, what if I go back to the BBC and they go, we've had a call from the police. The man at the garage, he saw you doing the dodgy deal. I love it. Well, what you do is. What you do is you put the Kayakar in a drain in your front garden and then go in and out of the toilet, just pouring bleach down or Ajax. And they never know. This is Song for the Lovers. Lovely song there. Song for the Lovers. Neil Young man needs a made off the Harvest album. What a beautiful song that is. Beautiful strings and everything. Well, you've got a song for the ladies coming up. Song for the Ladies later on as well. That's. That has set, you know, the standard. Well, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Were you gonna do a film review as well later? We've still got that. Well, I could do a film review now because it's. Well, if it's quite a big. I thought you needed to prepare, but. No, no, it's quite a big film, and I've seen it, and it is, you know, it's. It's a great. It's a great film. So I hope I can do it justice, because it's a very. Okay. This week. What film is it gonna be? It's gonna be Shinder's List. Okay. And are you gonna do a jingle for us? Film review. Okay. This is a film by Steven Spielberg. Yes. And it. Because it's in olden times, it's all black and white and that, except a coat that's red. I don't know what happened there. Anyway, it's about a bloke who's called Schindler. And because there were so many people we wanted to save. He had to make a list to get organized and he tried to save as many as he could. And that, you know, he made him sort of not make the bullets properly on purpose because he, you know, and in the end they gave him a ring. It's the same bloke who made et. Okay, your review of Shinder's list. And as ever, mark out of ten, please. Nine. It was brilliant. You really enjoyed it. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Did the fact that it was three hours long bother you? No, no. Quite like that. Okay, watch some of it on fast forward. Okay? Okay. Carl, have you seen Shinder's list? No. I'm surprised they managed to get all that in three hours. Amazing, isn't it? Would that encourage you to see the film? Definitely, yeah. Okay, what would you give it a mark out of 10? 9. You'd give it 9 as well. Okay, I'll tell you, red coat effect thing, you go, yeah, about us. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that was just a mistake, apparently. Apparently, yeah. Probably just couldn't get all the color out of it. As I said before, if you've got a film that you'd like to have reviewed by Ricky Gervais, then email us ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk and I'm sure he can. Or even not. Just like the people. But what about the ones who make the films? Like, you know, the ones that actually make the film. What are they called? Hollywood? Yes, if they want me to do one. But they're coming out to sort of give it a little bit of a boost. You saw me give away the tickets that was selling. Yeah. So, you know, we can. We can sell your product and we make it look like it's all editorial, but really, if there's a little bit of money involved, I can probably give it a 9 out of 10 instead of 4 or something. So would you do that without having seen the film? Yeah, that's fine. Because they wouldn't. They could just tell you what was coming up. And then if they said this, give us a good review and here's 20 quid. Yeah. If they go, oh, no, there's no money in it, I'll give it. Probably give it a bad. Can I just try that? Because a lot of people listening won't be necessarily convinced. Lord of the Rings. Let's imagine I've paid you now to. To review the forthcoming film, Lord of the Rings. What do you make of it? This is a brilliant film. And even though it's all about wizards and that, and there's people in caves called gonads with beards. Probably Robbie Coltrane's in it because he's in the other one at the moment. And there's. It's all swords and stuff, and there's some magic, but is actually the Lord of the Rings, not just like, you know, just one of them. He's the lord of it and he's. He's excellent in it. So mark out of 10. 9. Again. Very popular film for you, Carl. Less convinced by that one, maybe. That doesn't sound as good as the other one. Yeah. What are you gonna give it, seven? Still give it nine. You still give it an excellent because we're Split it. We split the money. Okay. Excellent. Good. This is the. This is the Eels. Sorry about that. That was a mistake. I got a shit that was. It was too late to get out of the CD players. Muse and Feeling Good. What do you think of that? I'm. I'm not a fan of Muse, but I wasn't quite as venomous in my hr. Don't worry, I won't play that again. No, well, let's. Let's explain the situation in the studio. There's a certain frosty air now because we ended up playing Muse. It was. It was a mistake. Yeah, but it's not that bad. Well, no, it's not. It's not as bad as Ricky thinks. I admit. It's not as bad as that, but I'm standing out of it because I'm not a fan of Muse. I wouldn't play Muse generally. Well, I don't mind Muse generally, but. What? I hate What? You like Muse normally. I hate Muse. Wow. I don't hate them. Says the man who bought the Like Funky Ones album. Well, yeah, but I wouldn't play them on xfm. I know, but Muse fits in. I mean, you're saying you want to play. Simone. Why do we play Radiohead, then? That's what I'm saying. Radio Ad. But Muse is like Radiohead. There's not a big difference. Anyway, we're not going to argue. There is a big difference. Phone. And if you. What's the difference between Muse and Radiohead? What's the phone number? What do you mean, what's the difference? Well, just have a competition. Let's see if people can tell the difference between Muse and Radiohead. Give the number out. Can't be bothered. Nor can I. So it's left to me to keep the thing afloat. Yeah, that's never good news. I went to see the White Stripes this week. If anyone's interesting, anyone interested in that, Come on, Steve. White Stripes are absolutely amazing. I've heard all the hype, you know, I've not listened to the album. I went along to the gig, got a free ticket, wasn't even a pound off, it was free £10. I could have. I could have sold outside the gig. I didn't. I went in, right. Couldn't take along a mate. XFM wouldn't let me. I went there on my own, you know, Went in there. I have to say, I wasn't expecting much. They were amazing. They were absolutely amazing. I have to say this now for. They were the best band I'd seen who were like. I didn't know much about or whatever, like a new band. They were the best band I'd seen live since I saw a little band you might have heard of called Oasis for £5 at Coventry Poly. Yeah, long name for a band. And it was amazing. And it's a pretty big. Because it's just the two of them, obviously. The girl on the drums, the guy playing the guitar, he's got a real kind of rock guitar skill. He really plays it up and down the. The long neck bit. I mean, I know all about the music and that, the terminology. Yeah, he was amazing. Sometimes he plays like kind of kind of steel with that steel pedal thing on his. Not still pedal, the finger thing. The kind of thimble thing that some guitarists wear. I believe it's called a guitar thimble, I believe is the name for it. And he plays that like old bluesman would play. He plays that sometimes. Somebody's got like a little electric keyboard thing, or piano, as I believe some people call it. So this isn't a review, this is listing the instruments. All right, all right. There's not many to get through with. There's some drums. What color microphones were they? I'm glad you were. Well, they SM58s. Anyway, the point is this go on with just those few simple instruments. They had this huge sound, a big rocky sound quality, kind of bluesy punk with a little bit of an edge into it. It was amazing. I have to say I was a huge fan and so I thought we could play a bit of White Stripes, you know, to sort of commemorate that excellent gig. I saw a band once, right? There was a drummer. Add all the drums at the bottom to the ones cymbals. Yeah, they were all mic'd up with different microphones coming down the loudy speaks. That was the back. It was still. Wow. I can hear everything on that electrical. Really? And a guitar and a bass. Can I do a. Like a gig review every week? Like you do your film review. Good. Yeah, we just did. Well, I'm about as well informed about music as you are about films. Anyway, tell me the. How do you choose the playlist? Feeder. Just a Day Now. Because we run out of time. Yeah. Because that Muse shit we had to play, I think I say that's my feature, that PlayStation game sounds good. Right, because that's the. The main music of the PlayStation 2 game, Gran Turismo. Right. So I could incorporate that. Brilliant. Yeah. And I've still got to get in song for the. You've got to get in song for the ladies. Yes. Got anything else lined up? Well, I just. I mean, it's just that I've never seen you spiral into such despair after hearing Muse. I mean, fair enough. Is that they're not great. Well, obviously we have to. You know, there's a bit of a playlist we have to keep to. And we drop the records we don't like. Yeah, right. And play the ones we do, and that's fine. And if I don't care for a track, I don't mention it. I don't usually slag off bands and I know we gotta keep to a playlist. I don't know how they're chosen or anything, but, you know, there's one thing I didn't want to play. It's Feeling Good. Yeah. And it was already lined up and there was no time, so I was. I was genuinely annoyed because I don't mind, like, playing stuff that I wouldn't actually choose myself. That's all right. But, you know, it. It. You know, we're not completely free played all the time. So. The worst thing is I don't ever play Feeling Good again. I don't want to ever play Cachin again. I'm thinking of putting a ban on gorillas. What? Anything you like to ban. Basement Jacks. Basement. Oh, where's your head at? We already. Where's your head? We dropped that on purpose, didn't we? What else have we dropped today? That. This is. That's what we saved people from. Do you know what I mean? Playing five songs over and over again just because some record company wants to be played. I mean, I. You know, if I'm gonna. If I'm gonna play things I hate, let pay me, you know, I mean, I'm willing to take bribes. Look, I've been sent some chocolates here by the lads. Out of what? Carter usm. Right. Are they still going? Yeah, they got a gig. The who's the Daddy Now? Tour. Right. They're playing the Astoria at December 14th. On December. It's worth going along just to see how few people will be there. Well, see that I wouldn't play, but they've sent me chocolate. So there's a, you know, there's a plug, you know, Bribe me, not xfm. Yeah. All right. Let's get some out of this, Steve. Okay. All right. Yeah. I'm not sure. I'm not sure even I'd sink so low is to be bribed by Carter. I mean, I'm a man who tried to buy dodgy speakers on the street. It's a Christmas. Father Christmas with some jelly beans. Is that from. Who's that from? That's from. That's from the lads. Oh, well, the. It's who's the Daddy now talk. Okay. And I got them. And I've got some chocolate money. Right. Lovely. Yeah, Some of it French. Got anything there from the senseless things or the wonder stuff? No, but, you know, we don't know. They know what they're doing now. Yeah. Carter was all right at the time. Carter was all right. Carter, yeah. Right. So you like Carter? Not really, no. It's nonsense. Well, I didn't like him singing about dagging them all the time, whatever it was. No, what was it? New cross? Yeah, but, you know, good. Funny. Anything else you want to get off your chest? Let's play some songs we like. What have you got lined up? I've got the song for the ladies that's coming up. Oh, lovely. Yeah, let's. Let's choose a song here. Let's have a look. This one here, Ricky. At what? Oh, Radiohead. Just brilliant. Is this. Mute Radiohead. And just off the bends. Now that's a track. It's been a roller coaster ride of emotions, this show. Yeah. It started off, there was some light hearted anecdotes about you and animals. Yeah. It ended up with you sort of spiraling into despair. Wow. You know, that's what a track by Muse can do to a man. Yeah. Well, clearly, you know, did I ever react? But then maybe. Well, I mean, maybe that's what makes them good. I mean, if music can, you know, create those kind of passions in someone, maybe that's effective. I don't know. We've made me think again. It's the punk approach, I suppose. Yeah. Anyway, Carl, thanks as ever for pressing the buttons and contributing. Yeah, good job, Good job. Shame about the muse. He's only getting a nine for his movie next week. I think you guys should kiss and make up. Maybe that's not Carl's fault. Go and kiss him. No, I'm not gonna kiss him. Go and touch him. Should we go both Go and touch him? Yes. Why don't we play a song for the ladies this week? Drugstore White. White Magic for Lovers. Beautiful track. And let's just go and kiss and touch Carl.",
