I procured some great gifts to give away. I was tired seeing all these other people getting gifts and that. And it was good all going to that O doddle and oh, diddly and Anderson and Sturgeon. Or she. At least she steals them herself. Well, at least she steals himself to sell them to feed the habit. And that's why I don't mind that. Because it's industrious ex. But I have got Feeder Echo Park. I've got the essential Bob Dylan. Now that is a good giveaway. That's a great giveaway. And Reloaded three. Did you buy these yourself? No, Little Kyle found them. I have to say, Carl, you've done an absolute dynamite job here, mate. This is great price. And I thought we could play that trivia quiz where we're the challenge. If they get someone to catch us out, maybe. Or some other question. You confuse me slightly. Explain again. Well, we could play a little trivia quiz, couldn't we? And then we could sell the fish. Use the words that you need to complete the sentence, Rick, then. And we could do this. What's the quiz? I don't know. You've not thought this through? No. Coldplay in yellow. You've got to keep talking, Rick. We're on the radio. I got bored. Did you XFM 104.9. Yeah. With Steve Merchant. What I was saying was, yes, we could have a little trivia quiz. Right. This is how it works. Their. Their phone in. Yeah. Right. And their pitch a question to us to. Right. We won't know it. They'll tell Carl. And Carl write down the answer. Yeah. Or on his email. Right. And then it might be something like, oh, who was the first woman mp? And write down the answer. And they go, okay, Steve, Ricky, who's the first one? Mp? We write it down, you know, I mean, you'll write down something like the Queen. Yeah, And I'll write down Britney Spears. And you go, well, Ricky says Britney Spears and the answer is the lady. See? Yes, yes, yes, yes. And then whoever's. So they phone in or do they. Can they email as well? They can email as well, Steve. Right, okay. So let me just try and clarify this because I didn't really follow that. And I know what the competition is, right? People listening phone in or email in with a question, a trivia question. It could be about anything. I Don't do game shows, but one. Which we may be able to get right. They phone in with that or they email it in, but only Carl knows the answer. He asks us here in the studio the question. Ricky and I write it down independently, we hand it to Carl, we see who's got the right answer. It's like 15 to 1 but 2 to 1. And the great thing is that the best question that we'll vote on at the very end of the show can win these three CDs we've got feeder, Echo park, the Essential. Bob did us a 2 CD set. Rick. Maybe keep the questions high brow to show our intellect, not things like pop and trivia and. Good idea. We've also got this big compilation, Reloaded 3 that's also a 2 CD compilation. We'll start phoning and emailing now. Absolutely. Questions? Gervais? I'm best in science. Well, don't start. Don't say that's not fair because I'll. Say I'm best at films if they want. Yeah, but I've already said don't do trivia in entertainment and that. Well, they should do. They should do trivia. Entertainment, music and films is what they should do. They shouldn't or old. That's. That's the cliche of XM listeners and I know they're more intelligent now. They're not. They're not, Rick. They're stupid people. They're stupid, stupid people and they only know about a few things. Garbage. Cherry lips on XFM 104.9. Well, either they really want those CDs or they want to embarrass us because the phone lines are going mad. They are going mad. We didn't even give out the phone number or the email. Rick, Shall I just give it out now? Well, obviously don't need to. Well, I ought to anyway. For those that didn't hear it but didn't know it already of it. 0870-0870-0800-1234 sorry, that's not. 087-00-8700 because I started again because I got. I sort of fluffed slightly. Yeah, go on. 087-00-800-1234 and when he says he fluffed. Like that, that's not how he got into television. Exactly. Ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk if you want to email the question, only Carl can see the screen. So there's no cheating. Probably. People don't know what fluffing is, do they? No, I don't think so, Rick. Carl, have you had a question? What, already? Are we doing it now? I think we should just drip them in through the course of the show. Yeah, you. Good one. Dripping them in. Go on, ask this question. I thought this was a good one. It's from Clive. Go on. In Clive. We got a listener called Clive. Wow. That's all right. Who was the first James Bond? Oh, it's his film. I didn't know that. No, but wait a minute, wait a minute. I know this ambiguity because we've talked about. We've talked about this ambiguity before. You see, he couldn't. But he might be deliberately embarrassing us because the old myth is that someone played it on radio. Yeah. That we all know and love. Yeah. Now he should have specified. Did he mean the film James Bond? The first film? Can I just say, we won't count this one because the definitive one. I've talked to Glenn about it as well. It. It's Dr. No. Was the first one of the team that we. Sean Connery. So Sean Connery is the first screen James Bond. So we agree on that, even if we're both wrong. What did he say it is? I bet he said. I bet he said it was Bob Holness who played him on radio in like the 1950s. He didn't say the radio bit, but he said Bubba Holness from Blockbusters. Yeah. And I was drawing a little Blockbuster thing. That's really spooky. That is. That's weird, isn't it? But the thing about that is I. I'm worried if it might be a myth. It may be. Well, no, I don't. I don't think it is. It's that, that we can't. One point to me then. No. Yes. No. Did you know it? Did you know it? Did you know we talked about it. No. Rubbish. Yeah, but who, When? If we talked about it. Did I say it to you? No. We agreed that it was Sean Connery because it just like we didn't count Casino Royale because you said it wasn't by the same team. Yeah, but that wouldn't have been the first James Bond anyway because that came later in the series. No, Rick. No, no, no, no. Don't play the music. That's clearly your point. You didn't know it was Bob Holness. He meant it was Bob Holness. I knew the answer. One nil. Well, fun loving criminals. Scooby Snacks. Anyway, it doesn't matter because we, we both agreed once in a pub that the right answer is Sean Connor. Wait A minute. The point's not that the man phoned in with a question and the answer the man was after was Bob Holness. And that's the answer I want. The answer I was after was me. But that's nonsense. He's the question master, the man who phoned in. That's ludicrous. Deface the facts. You can't say, what number am I thinking of? It's gotta be the real answer. No, but I knew the answer he was after. So. Brilliant. Yes, because that's, you know, even if he's got it wrong, it's such common parlance now that Bob Holness was the first James Bond that I knew the answer. Face the facts. Right, Give us another question, Carl. Jeez. Give us another question, guys. A bad loser. I had a good one here, but you forgot it or I sort of scribbled it down. This is brilliant, isn't it? Hang on a minute. We can edit this out, can't we? It's not like it's only a piler. This is gonna look great when it. When it comes out. Go on. Which food? Yeah, Car. You know, making up the question. No, no. It's just that I sort of took down the important bits. But this is amazing. This is amazing. Radio. Go on. Which food kind of doesn't make you fat? Jesus. What kind of a question is that? Oh, this is ridiculous. No, it is proper. I love. I love. Imagine this on the Weakest link. What kind of food doesn't sort of make you. I mean, it doesn't make you fat. What is this? Okay, do you want me to. Basically, no sort of calories in it. Celery. Water. Well, I mean, what do you mean? Do you mean a vegetable? You're right. You're right. Apparently, yeah. It uses up more calories to bite it than. Yeah, but wait a minute. Wait a minute, Rick. One, one all. No, it's not one all. Because you're supposed to write it down. You didn't know, but you didn't. What do you mean, I didn't know? You're supposed to write it down. That's the whole point. We're writing things. You said water. You said water. But that's because I thought we weren't taking the question seriously. Because he doesn't know what he's talking about. One all. We gotta set the rules. Bit too much like Portishead for my liking. Was it? Yeah, I quite enjoyed it. Beat a band. Well, that's because Portishead are from your neck of the woods, isn't it is it. I embarrass myself. Right, well, another question, quick. Is this, Is this one. Is this question a real. With a definitive answer or is it like what is my most comfortable chair? I don't know why people aren't going to maybe like trivia pursuit or something? Just getting a questioning off that and. Then because they're a little bit more discerning than that. Steve, have you heard the questions? They don't know what they're talking about. This is stuff they've overheard in pubs. Come on, ask it, ask it, Carl. I look when the car takes down and goes, what's that? What am I meant to write? Go on then, ask this one. Right, what sort? No, the Pope. Yeah, what semi. Sorry, Mrs. Robinson, we'll have to let you go. Yeah, go on. You are the weakest link, Carl. Goodbye. Yeah, go on. The Pope. Yeah, the Pope. Yeah, we've got the Pope. Yeah, that's not strictly a question. He wears a. Hey. Wears a dustman's at. He wears gore blimey trousers. Yeah, yeah. He lives in a council flat. Wears a semi precious stone. What's the stone? The Pope wears a semi precious stone. What is the stone? You mean, what is it called? Yeah, what is it called? What has it got like a kind of paper? I think it's like, you know, is it. Is it a 18 carat one? So we gotta try and get the carrot. Yeah, of the Pope's big diamond. Dennis, he calls it. Dennis the stone. Do they want the. Do they want the type of gem it is, like? Or is there some kind of papal name for it? Or do they want it like the Rosetta Stone or. I don't know, the. Oh, I can't play a record. Play two records. Let's stop. Where's your hat at? Basement jacks. Right, okay, let's get this. Have we. Have we. Have we knocked this on the head then? Is this not happening? Oh, here he is, look, here he is. Come in. Oh, I don't believe that. That's pathetic. I do not believe that. That's absolutely pathetic. Now they won't believe this, will they? Right, if I say that Jonathan Ross just got his massive member out and he is a big lad. Come here, come and sit down. I've got your tickets, Mr. Gervais. Thank you. What's going on here then? I mean, why are you dropping off tickets? Well, because, you know, in the spirit, the comedy awards, we like to have the rising young stars of the British comedy. That's right. And that's me. Well, we Couldn't find any this year. So we've asked Vicki whether he would sit in the rising young star seat. And I wanted to deliver the tickets personally. So there's no excuses if he doesn't turn up later. Yeah. I always suspected that you were sort of pretty well endowed. Yeah. And now? And now we've seen. You know. It's on webcam. That was just one of my. That's the one you're wearing today. Don't say that. No, we were just going to be the happening young station. What's going on? No, you can't say stuff like that. You can't. Just Careful what you say. Look after Julian Clary comes back in a personal life. Ten years in the wilderness. What happened to you? That's Jesus you're thinking of. Just because you're on everything at the moment. I walked in here and I came in there and I thought. This is the young happening place. And what do I see in there? Three old men sitting, talking about. I'm only 28, 27. You all look. You're wrecked. You all look wet. You're tired. Well, that's cuz we're always partying. I was looking for some youngsters. Where's the youngsters? I wanted to see some tight leather pants. I wanted to see some foxy chicks hanging on you everywhere. What is it? It's a bunch of old blokes and a bloke. They're washing up in a sink. But look at him. Even dresses for radio. This is ludicrous. It's amazing. Looks like. I love the fact you were on. The phone to Gervais last night, weren't you? Asking his advice? Yeah, on clothes. Look at him. He's going for the man down the dss. I like that look. No, it's a nice look. Have you got a single pair of trousers that aren't elasticated at the wa. They're maternity jeans, aren't they? A whole frank panel. That thing is what I do at the end of the week. I can pop these in the pan and I can make a nice soup with all the food that's encrusted in them. At these years as a homeless come to the floor. Look at you. One step away from Lawrence, Llewellyn and Bowen. I'd like to be. I'd like to be that bit closer. But why are you dropping off tickets? Are you? A little bit. Because I thought you were married and stuff. Why do you suddenly got this obsession with Gervais? Because I'm a bit rough and I. Yeah. It's like when you see Dale Winter now with those rough boys. I'd like to get one of young when. When a top celebrity in a lovely looking suit drops, walks down the corridor with his penis out. Yes, I know that. I'm still, you know, you've arrived. I was. I was in Oregon the same way. For me it was Des O'Connor. It's like. It's the passing on of the baton, if I may use that euphemism. And you've been battened. It's fantastic. Well, it is a pleasure. I don't think I'm complacent just because I'm mixed with you. I still wake up and think, I don't believe it. I mates with Jono. Can I just point them out? I was listening to the show last week and I heard you, as always, revealing a little too much about yourself, if you don't mind me saying so, Steve. Tr. Not as much as you, no. But that was just for the. For the benefit of the room and talking about when you used to occasionally urinate in the sink. Yeah. When you were around my house last time and I came in and you. Looked a bit shifty. No, please reassure me. It was more ownership that I was like. I went to my territories and then. Then other people that come in and go, has Gervais been around here? It's like just marking my terrace because. My coffee the next morning had a hazelnut tang to it that I don't remember putting in. Can I just say something? Because, I mean, I used to, I used to, you know, mention to you, Gervais, when we first started getting involved in the business, I used to say, if there was one celebrity I'd like to be friends with this Jonathan Ross. Yeah. Lo and behold, Ricky's befriended Jonathan Ross. I'm nowhere to be seen, not invited around. Ricky told me that I could be his friend, providing I. I never extended the arm of friendship. Yeah. If you ever. I thought it's much. He tries to keep everyone else down. He works with from the office, all the other shows, he tries to keep him down. I didn't even. I wanted to meet you on the steps. Yeah. I didn't want to turn you around. But you called, he went, who's that? And he saw your name come up and he went, can I meet him? Well, you're. You're coming tonight, aren't you? This isn't radio too, by the way. These links are way too long. This is snappy radio. We have to play. Yeah. The kids have Lost interest. The kids want to hear Coldplay Cut a turd. You know I like this. How about some more of that instantly forgettable hip hop you play each week? One of those obscure hip hop. Hooray. That's the worst feature on British radio. You should be ashamed of yourself. Put it away. Put it away. I'm Carl. Carl. How you doing? All right. Got a question for you, white man. Got a question. Yeah. The Pope. Yeah. What semi precious stone does the Pope wear? That is easy. Go on. Topaz. Is that the right answer? I don't know. I might have wrote it down. I'm really sorry, Jonathan. It's not. It's not what he publicly admits to. But I have to know because I was hanging out with him at the Groucho one night and he was saying, oh, look at this, look at this, look at that top edge. You can't buy that. Look at that, look at that. Vatican City, look at that. We can make a nice ring out of that. He says, didn't go anywhere, but thanks for asking. I better go. I've gotta go. I gotta go buy some winkle pickers. Thank you very much. Okay, enjoy it, Carl. I wish I could say it'd been a pleasure, but actually it was quite creepy. See you later, you two. Beautiful day. Yep. Now, I was just saying that's probably one of my singles of the year, but was it this year or the year before? Oh, crumbs. I don't know, it was, I think, was it 2000 that Albert was the first one off the album? Maybe. That could be a question. No, we need the answer, don't we? We don't know the answer. No, we. Oh, it's gone. Can I just ask? Jonathan Ross just came in there to drop off some tickets for the comedy award show that he's hosting later this evening. Yeah. Interesting. Of course, a man who's 40 and still thinks it's funny to get his penis out it. I love that because it's like, when's that. When's that novel you're gonna wear off? 74,75. When it's just too horrible to show in public, I imagine. But, but. So he dropped off some tickets for you. Yeah. Was asking you fashion advice last night. Yeah, came. I mean, he came after a three hour radio show. He's just on a radio too. Good show, by the way, worth tuning in. He came straight right here, dropped some tickets off for. He's now got to go and rehearse that show. Lovely man. I was out with you last night. Yeah. Went into this, this pub, like kind of that we've been to a few times before. Went in there and this guy came in and said, you usual table, Ricky, your usual table. Can I just ask you two questions? Godfather one is, have we won a prize tonight on the table? I know. We genuinely don't know. Can you have someone iced for me? What are you suddenly got over all these people that they're doing all this way? When have you suddenly become the daddy? Well, I came from nowhere and you know I've got Polaroids of the head of all the stations. Yeah, exactly. Because what I'm worried about is that like when we're wrapped up in our winter coats, you're walking on there and you're a little sort of, you know, little black overcoat and I must look like your hood, do you know what I mean? Like your goon that walks with you. Twice as tall, very much like Edward G. Robertson. Exactly. Yeah, you are with a pug face. Obviously. Yeah, well, don't go on about it. Sorry. All right, no one doesn't know. You just thought that even Jonathan Ross couldn't save this show. No, it is the only a celebrity I know. I'm all out of ideas. I thought we'd have a trivia game. That's rubbish. Cuz he can't read or write. Yeah, and that's a. What is it? So are we knocking the trivia game off? Yeah. Yeah. Let's have one final question. What's the answer? I don't know, I don't know. For the Pope one. I don't know. We couldn't even figure out the question. Carl, what's the stone? What's the stone? It a minute. Just entertain yourselves at home while Carl looks for the question. And thirst. Amethyst. Amethyst, yeah, and thirst. No, she was the first woman mp, I think you'll find. Am Thirst rubby or Diamondo? So have you got maybe a final. Question and then we knock this on the head. Yeah, go on in. Where? What? Who? Have you not been practicing in all these? We've had ads, we've had music. Oh, where? What? Rick, I don't think we should call ITV Letter. Maybe he was talking about Jonathan's inquiry about sartorial elegance tonight. Where? What? Yeah, maybe he's just like summed up that conversation. Expensive pub in London. He won't know because he never pays. Hang on, wait a minute. What does that mean? What does that mean? You want me to buy or buy the pub? How much? That's a million pounds. If you Go in according to The Timeout Guy 2001, if you went in there and bought a big round, it's a big deer pub. It's an expensive. Imagine this on Millionaire. Imagine that question. I know your specialized subject, Al. How much things are in that and that, and whether they make you fat when you eat them. Then it's in London. Is this like some guy went in the pub last night and thought, this is a bit pricey. I'm going to expose them on Ricky and Steve's show. Does it mean, like, maybe. Is it a pub or a club, maybe, where you've got to be a member? That's a pub. I'll narrow it down. It's in Covent Garden. Punch and Judy. That's it. Has he got it right? Yeah. Well, I have to hand it to you. Well done. Yeah. So brilliant. So who. Who was that? Who was that question from? Because maybe that they should get these three CDs. Let's. Let's. Let's give them that. Who is it, Carl? There's no way of verifying that. That's probably libelous. They've probably made a timeout guide. Okay. All right. You got it right. Yeah. I won. I won. Yeah. Carl, who was it that won? Well, listen, they know, so they've won. Yeah. Right. This is genius radio. This is brilliant. He wasn't out in a stone, him. I know, KP the P Man, when he was just. He was just doing the press buttons and it was cool. Now we let him on the air because we thought it was funny. We quite like him. He's digging a grave for us. Right, listen, this is a new feature I've introduced called Songs I'd like to Play on the Radio. Oh, this is falling apart. And. And a friend of mine sent me a little CD of little treats and stuff. One of them is this track. It's Monkey Man. It's from the Rolling Stones Player Car. It's an absolute gem. Xfm 104.9. What was that again, Steve? Rolling Stones and a track called Monkey Man. That's from a double cd, not available in the shops. My friend Dave G made a compilation for me, burned it onto CD using modern technology. That's one of the tracks on there. What's his name? What's his name? Dave Greenwood. Obviously breaking several copyright laws there. I would not encourage anyone to make copies of anything for any on. It's breaking the law again. If a police. Listen, Dave Greenwood lives in Nottingham. I can give details. He's making you receive, you know, stolen. Goods and There are various artists on there who've barely got a penny, who losing money hand over fist. The Rolling Stones, for instance. Yeah. XFM have done that as well. Played it off, you know, and that's terrible. Now we've implicated those as well. Ex ephemera culpable. So is Dave G. Thankfully not us, Rick. We're just middlemen caught up in it. You know What I mean? Mr. Biggs behind this. There's always Mr. Biggs. Pawns in his game. So that's. I'll be playing another track from that later on. I've got a lovely couple of little tracks on my hip hop selection. Looking forward to it. Did you get a little gift here from xfm? I did. I got a lovely little voucher here. It was very nice. You're very thoughtful. I've also got one. How much is yours for £25 to. Spend at John Lewis or Waitrose? A little kind of gift voucher there. Oh, I think I'd. Oh, I think I'll do Waitrose. Because food, you can get a good lot of food for 25 quid. Absolutely right. You can't get a lot of like haberdashery. So I'll be getting food options. Think about the gift of H. A lot of people were, I'm sure, receiving these over the Christmas period. The thing about the gift factor is it's like. It's like, here's £25, but I've limited where you can spend it. It's. It's like. It's like they don't give money because that's go say, this is like money but not as versatile. Exactly. You can't spend it in as many places. But it's. The thing is that surely the thing about a gift is, you know, you don't want people to know how much. It was unless you're letting them make their buck their ideas up for next year. Like, you know, I mean, if an aunt gives you like, you know, a single, like a step single, and you've given her 25 quid, the body. Sh. You're saying you know how much that single cost? So do I. I'm not gonna say. Right, let's make up the difference next year, you know, I mean, let's spend 50 quid on me next year. Do you know how much he got? How much did he get? Did you get a gift voucher as well? But I work here all week. Right. How much do you get? 150. 150 quid? What, on gift vouchers to spend at the Same places. I'd have to say, though. I mean, it's not a very inventive gift, is it? Whoever came up with it, It's a lovely thought. It's wonderful to have £25 that I can only spend in two places I never go in. But no, no, I'm not looking a gift horse in the mouth. Looking a gift horse in the mouth. It is a treat. He spoke to Jonathan Ross like he was a normal person from someone whose. Dad buys him a spade for Christmas. I thought you'd be grateful. My only thought is that John Lewis and Waitrose. I mean, it's not very rock and roll. It's not very xfm, is it? No, I mean, a tattoo parlor. Yeah. Maybe, you know, in a bike shop, piercing. I might get my face pierced. Just a big salt through my head. But, I mean, they're a little bit, aren't they? A little bit like the man, aren't they? A little bit mainstream? Yeah. What would be that? We were rocking. I'll play a record and don't make it a square record. Someone. An indie label or something. Or something that hasn't been even recorded. Yeah. That can't even become available ever. I don't know what instruments they're playing. Oh, some 41 in too deep. All right, Steve? It's been a long time, eh? Isn't it? What? Luckily. That seemed a long time. Well, that music. Yes, no, you're absolutely right. Yeah. It's annoying, actually, that Carl never went to the email because the questions have been sent in there, good questions, and they've all been sort of neatly spat out with the correct answer. For instance, I might have asked you this if I was the quiz master. How many noses do slugs have? Oh, I think it's four. It is four. Yeah. Point to you there. Let me just see if I can find another one. Who, according to the current issue of viz, is a cycloptic pop temptress. Oh, don't know. Is it a pun on her having one eye and being sounding like cycloptic? Is the clue. Only one Pop temptress. Oh, it's Gabrielle, of course. Yeah. Two points. Mine are better. He didn't get them. These are rubbish. Have you ever watched a question? Because I can understand the question. They're rubbish, I suppose, aren't they? It gives me a chance to know what. What? The answer is required. Go on, let me see if I can find another for you. No, that's. You're never gonna get that one. That's too hard. Oh, no, that just. That just. That just teases you more, isn't it? What's the name of. Well, that's boring, that one. Sorry. It's beginning to fall apart again now. Here we are. What's the proper name for Big Ben? Is it St. Stephen's Tower? You know, it absolutely is. That's three out of three. That's fantastic. Yeah. Because at the bow, named after something like Benjamin, so and so works in it as soon as tower needs. That's the big bang. It's actually, in a weird way, I didn't know any of those. So it's actually quite good that we did kind of balls it up with Carl, because otherwise I'd have. There'd have been egg on my face. Yeah, but I still won. I just won less. Oh, did you? Yeah, you did win. Yeah, yeah. I've already forgotten, already wiped out of my memory. Yeah. But, hey, Steve, it's not me that's the real winner. It's Neil who asked that question about pubs, about pubs. And he's got those three CDs. Just tell him what they are again. Just Feeder, Echo Park, a compilation called Reloaded 3. Lots of great stuff on there. And the essential Bob Dylan 2 CD. Have you called him and told him? No, not yet. This is such a shambles in it, because what if he goes out or. Summer, actually, if he's listening, can he give us a call? That is so lazy. Can't we call him like Tarrant would? You've not got his number, I forgot. Oh, this is unbelievable. Get the numbers, Carl. I. I wanted to go for the Pope one. Carl, do you actually work here in the week or like, did you just, you know, like in a film where they knock someone on the head, put on the spacesuit and go to the moon? Is it like. Yeah. Is it like Secret of My Success and Michael J Fox? You actually work in the post room. But Saturdays, there's no one around that. Recognizes you, so you pretend that you're a producer. Yeah. Because you don't seem to know any. Of the rules, because I reckon that name's made up. When did I say a producer? When did I say Carl Pinkerton is a name that you'd come up with on the spot? No, he doesn't work it. No, he's not producing. He says he works in sound. Yeah. Well, I'll tell you what, work with this. This is my song for the lovers. It's a beautiful track. I've played it before, I'll play it again. It's one of my favorite Tracks of all time. It's Bob Dylan. If you see her, say hello. It's a little bit trivia for this is the last song I ever played on the old XFM before they came in and said, okay, you can go now. That's incredible. And it's bringing tears to my eyes. Lovely. Well, the greatest singer songwriter of all time. Beautiful. With one of his best songs there, Bob Dylan. If you see her, say hello. She might be in Tangiers. I mean, he's. He's having a go. He's. I mean, if you're gonna go to Tangiers on the off chance to try and find her, I wouldn't bother. Yeah, you know, I mean, you know. If you're gonna be there. He's desperate. He's desperate. She might be in Tangy. Have you checked upstairs? She's definitely not upstairs. Just. Just have a look. Well, anyway, that was Song for the Lovers, but because I'm so excited about having such great prizes to give away for the first time, some albums that Carl found. We've got the lucky winner on the line. Hi, Neil, you there? Yeah, here, Ricky. Hi. You're a winner with xfm. Fantastic. Yeah, yeah. Do you. Do you like Feeder? They're a good group, aren't they? Well, yeah, the kids seem to like him. They do. The kids like them. And then Bob Dylan, he's a. He's a great, lovely bloke with a guitar, isn't he? You're working hard, aren't you? I'm. I'm fed up with this, mate, really. Honestly, I just don't know what else to do. I come in every week. I try. Try? Yeah. You have to write a new series of. Of the Office. I'm trying, but I've got voiceover work now, so. There's more money in that. You're everywhere. Yeah, yeah. Woolies adverts. Yeah. Sorry, I shouldn't mention that, Shannon. No, it's all right. So, Neil, Steve Merchant here. Will you be looking forward to receiving these albums? You've got Feeder, Echo Park, Bob Dylan album, the Best of, and a compilation. You looking forward to them? Absolutely, absolutely. You know, I mean, it's gonna really lift my Christmas hole. I'm not gonna get. Not gonna get to go home this year, so that's gonna make up for it, I'm sure. Neil, what? Of those three, which one will you be putting on first? I think Feeder, Echo park, because the kids seem to like it. Okay, excellent. Thanks very much. What are you doing for the rest of the weekend? You gonna. Chilling, man. I'M freezing. I'm playing golf right now. That's madness. It's very cold out here. What's your handicap? It was my handicap. My short game's terrible, but. Right. Yeah, yeah. You're gonna be watching the National Comedy Awards this evening. I hear that the Office is nominated. Ah, you guys are the shoe in. Sorry? You're shoo in. It's yours. Thank you. I don't know what a shoe in is, but I'd like to go to one. I think it means, like, foot in the door. Lovely. Yeah. No, not footing the doors like it's yours. Your name's already on it. Oh, really? I would think so, yeah. Well, why would Ross stop around? I don't think he makes the decisions. Neil, thanks very much for calling. Those. Those prices are gonna be winging their way to you. We're just like real DJs, aren't we, Neil? Just say we're just like real DJs and we'll leave you alone. You guys are just like real DJs. Enjoy your game. Cheers. Bye. Step on my old size 9 stereophonics. Absolutely. Well, talking to Neil, it all brought it home, you know, Maybe I should give a little bit back. Yeah, you've had a good year. I'm hanging out with Jonathan, Ross. I'm doing ads. Yeah. But I care. I'm still in touch, you know. I mean, I'm still down with it, you know. Yeah. And, you know, it's coming up the time of year where we should, you know, care about people less, forcing ourselves. And what I've done, I've recorded a. A Christmas single. That's beautiful. And all proceeds are going, you know, to, you know, little sick people and that. And are there going to be any proceeds? There's gonna be. Not a sausage. Right. So I'm safe. But I'll tell you this. I was thinking, actually, I was listening this morning, and you doing some Christmas shopping. You go in the shops and there's always, you know, walking in a Winter Wonderland and all those songs, you know, no one writes those sort of things anymore. No. Well, you're wrong, Steve. Really. Listen to this. What's it called? Don't cry. It's Christmas. Let's hear it. Don't cry, my baby Santa's coming soon Though you ain't got a mommy or daddy Santa still loves you and he's riding on his reins Reindeer to trample down the glue so don't cry, my baby Santa gonna make it soon. Don'T. Cry, my baby Santa's feeling kind though you know, you never see him. He's not just in your mind. And it's not that he's invisible, it's because you're going blind. So don't cry, it's Christmas. Santa still on time. Don't cry, my baby. Santa's on his way. You know, he's got 6 billion children and he's only got one day. You've got slightly less than that. If I were you I'd pray. So don't cry, it's Christmas, you're nearly 10. It's a little game. You know, as far as I'm concerned it's already become a standard, one of the classics. Thanks. There's a star Ash. Good. It's a great show so far, isn't it? Enjoying it Rick. But I'll tell you this, what worries me is something we've not done, which is what we've not. We've not taken on board. Some stuff I've heard from the management. They've said they've enjoyed the kind of light hearted flippery, you know, in the past on the show and you know, the likes of Jonathan Ross getting there just. Yeah, but they just feel that sometimes it's a little bit cheap, a little bit crass and I just want to perhaps be a little bit more highbrow at times. A little. Well you're a smart guy. Well, if I've proved that with clothes having four noses in Stephen's tower. Can I ask you Rick, about politics? What do you want to know? What do you want to know? Because politics. I'm a political person. I thought this much. Go on. What? On the politics, what do you make of who to vote for? Vote for the government, whoever's in the government. Yeah. The liberals ever. No, not if they're not in government. Okay, what about the foot and mouth which a lot of people have worried about? Don't worry about it. No, no. Recession is hit, a lot of people losing their jobs. Should they. What should they do about it? Another one. Get another job. Yeah, and I'll tell you what this is and this is. I mean you can have this for free if you do lose your job or summer get another one, but get one that's even better than the one you lost. Right, okay, good advice. Yeah. Maybe get, maybe if you were just like kind of the post boy before. Like Carl, get in charge of the company, get a manager's job. Right. Become director general or something. More money. Good, good, good, good. And don't lose that one. Okay. And what else is concerning? People know A lot. We get call time wrecked to the station, people saying, I'm worried about the war in Afghanistan. Yeah. Yeah. What do you make of the war? Is it. Is it one of your favorites? Well. What? No, no, no, no, no, my favorite. All war is bad, but, oh, my favorite. I'm putting you on the spot here. What is your favorite? Is he really? Yeah, yeah. Is it Falkland's War? It was a range war. What does that mean? That means. Carl. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah. Drawing pictures at school and that. Yeah. It. It means that our missiles could go sort of 17 kilometers, and the archers don't have missiles that go like, you know, 9km. So we just parked our boats about 12, 13k and we were shelling them. I mean, shelling it out of there. And theirs were falling in the water. Yeah. So it's the war equivalent of holding a. At arm's length. Right. And he's trying to punch you and. He can't reach you or just kicking him in the balls. Rick, a lot of people talk about WW1 as being the Great War. Was it a great war? No, it was a good war. It wasn't a great war. Right. What's the problem? Well, I liked all the. I like the bayonets and the trenches and all that stuff, but I could have done without the poetry. Right. Only because the poetry's a little bit bent and you know what I'm saying? It's the only time that it isn't, Ben, in a war. But, you know, there's. There's beautiful, but there's one I remember. He goes, we are the dead. Once we lived Felt dawn on our face but now we lie in Flanders fields. Be honest, if you'd have had a gun in your hand instead of a pen. Yeah. You might be laughing and the war would have been over by Christmas. Absolutely. High five. Yeah. So that's politics, Carl. Any other questions you want solved? Any high Economics? I've done economics because, yeah, it's economical. Anything else? I just think you should look after yourself. Carl. I've just got something to say to you. Hip hop hooray. Let's play my hip hop track Put your hands in the air Yay. Move them around like you just don't. Care yeah, you're not even bothered. I'm playing an old school track this week, Rick. I'm going back in time Rewinding the. Clock how you spelling school, Steve? Oh, with a K. Go on. Ever heard of anything by Digital Underground? The Humpty Dance might, you might the Humpty Dance. Do you remember that? That was a fellow sat on the wall. Yeah, yeah. And he was. He was getting dissed by the police and he fell and he broke all up. And the king's horses shouldn't have really been sent to. To repair an egg. They couldn't do it because of their hooves anyway. Digital Underground, for those that don't remember, was an Oakland group led by Shock G and Chop Master J. Go on. But of course, most famous now for the fact that they featured Tupac Shakur. Love him where he first began. You'll hear him on this track. It's called. What's it. Which one have I chosen here? I think it's called the same song. Have a listen. Ross was slagging off the hip hop feature, wasn't he, when he came in earlier? And how can he not like that? Digital Underground, same song. I think he was scared of it, Steve. I think it was intimidated by your. By your youth. Well, he's scared of the youth. He's scared the fact that I'm down with it. The homers and the bitches and the hoes. Yeah, because he's not with that, you know, he looks dapper. If they saw him in the street walking down like a ponce, they'd just laugh and jeer, probably rhythmically. Yeah. You know, and he couldn't come back. At anything and you'd be high fiving. I think he was intimidated by your style. I think he's jealous of you, to be honest. You know, I think what he's probably most jealous of is the looks. Do you know what I mean? I got the new haircut because we might be on the telly later. He didn't mention that, did he? Well, he's never seen the old one. You kept it from me. He's got nothing to compare it with. But that was a great hip hop selection there. Yeah, lovely. Even though I say so yourself, Rick. We've had a couple of people because they've listened to your dissection of current politics and economicals. Yeah. And they've got a couple of questions for you. Go on. We've had one from Jimmy Ruffin. He says, what becomes of the brokenhearted? Oh, oh, oh, dear. That is a difficult one. I don't think I've got time to go into it because it's a very delicate problem. Can you answer this one from the klf? What time is love? Any ideas? Listen, keep those questions coming in for recognizing, maybe to sort them out later. We got a single Biker. Yeah. Still the kind of song it's not. The end of the world. Super fairy animals. Absolutely beautiful. Xfm 104.9 R. You going to do. Your film review for us? We got time for it, I think. I'm not, no. Why not? I'm not going to do it anymore. You're not going to do anymore? You love it, don't you? No, it's great. And I just think it's time, you know, I did. I did a dozen, but I did all the. Do the films that I would give like nine or, you know, 10 out of 10 for. I don't want to drop the standards. Right. I don't want to start doing films that are eight out of ten. Yeah. You see. Yeah. That's where a lot of film reviews go wrong. Yeah. Ross being one of them. Yeah, I've seen them go wrong. Oh, this is worth 7. Don't do it then. If it's no good, don't do it yourself. No, sure. So. So no more film reviews. No. Until a great film comes out. Sure. Like Braveheart 2 or something. Which would be which? Well, nine now. An eventful. Yeah, I'd have thought. Yeah. Yeah. So nine for that advance. Rick, it's almost the end of the show and still got time for the Song for the Ladies. But Carl won't be here next week. Only where's going? Where you heading, Carl? Going away for Christmas. Tell us. What? It's a secret. What you want in case. In case your fans try and track you down. What are you going taking pictures of planes in Greece? What? What? Political, Rob your house. Satirical, Steve, satirical. Where are you going? What you do if I tell you? What if I was caught in a foreign country and. And. And the government got said. No, it's okay. There were train spotting or planes. I go, no, I am a spy. Exactly. No, I am a spy. No, you. It's all right, you were train spotting. I was. Wasn't. Wasn't spying. Please. I saw you at the Doctor who convention as well. No, no problem. I'm probably an assassin. Carl, where are you going, mate? Tell us. Come on, we haven't got time to say when. What's out here? What, people rob your house if. Yeah, we didn't say. Tell us your address, tell us where you leave the key and then tell us you're going on holiday. We said, where are you going on holiday? Barbados. Oh, yeah, Showing off. Boosting. I'll tell you what, Steve, what I'd like to see and a lot of the listeners right there too, do pop around there now. Touch him for Christmas. Should I touch him for Christmas? Touch him any way you like for Christmas. Can I just introduce a song for the ladies? We'll love him for Christmas, though. Can I just say. Yeah, as long as you love and touch. I'm gonna leave you with the excellent Tim Buckley, of course, Father of Jeff. I'm just gonna be watching. But love. Look at his little face. Also on that CD that my friend Dave sent me earlier. So if you don't like it, blame him. Yeah. While he's been arrested by the copyright police and it's called buzzing fly, let me touch you. Go on for Christmas. I'm not going. Put touch with your. Feminine side of I can put you in touch with your feminine side and my feminine. I'm liking it, so I can't. Look, I'm busy. Look, I'm busy.",
