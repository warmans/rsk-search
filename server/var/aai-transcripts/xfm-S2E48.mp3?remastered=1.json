  "text": "James Addiction. Just because on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. We're all here then. Oi, oi. About five past one, yeah. Got two hours to go. I imagine you've got all kinds of treats lined up where there's lots of. Things on the show. Great music, you know, Nirvana, Radiohead, the Darkness, to name but three. Can I play something from Led Zeppelin? Yeah, please do. And maybe some Neil Young now, coming up, also on the show, we're continuing a thing we start. We've only got four weeks to go before, or maybe we either give it all together or go away for a couple of months. Three weeks now. Is it three weeks? Oh, I don't know. I think it's the 16th of August. It'll end soon enough. Wow. Might be that it'd be a shame to end it forever, but it's all up to Carl. So again, he's in a grumpy movie, should try and up his attitude. And it's. It's them. It's the listener that counts, Carl, not us. We may be feeling bad, but you the listener count, you come first. Yeah, okay. Up, up, up. Yeah, big, big them up. Big up London. Big up. You the listener, Carl. Leave yourself at home for a little while. Yeah, we're going to continue that thing we started last week. We're doing the list of the most hated people in Britain. It's not us, it's the listener. So keep coming with those suggestions of people. You just. Obviously you don't hate them. We don't want a list of mass murderers, dictators and politicians. You can't have them. But with mass murderers and politicians, what's the difference? Good, good point, good point. Satire, satire. Yeah, that's. We're doing some jokes like that as well, aren't we? Satire like that. Trying to get onto Radio 4, trying. To get on there. Yeah. And if there's any kind of amusing show that perhaps takes a sideways look at the week's news, if there are. Any Radio 4 producers who have been knocking around for about 12 years with the same old hacks and they're desperately trying to get on telly, they want to give us a call. We're not interested. No, no. We've got bigger fish to fry. Yeah. So if people that you hate, minor celebrities, people on TV, pop stars you don't like, email in ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk and. I'll tell you what, then we'll do like the Channel 4 do. Then we'll give you the sort of list of the top 10 at the end and you can vote within that top 10. I'll tell you the ones that. Sorry, could we wire up some kind of premium rate phone line so that we make a fortune. We can't afford it. But if. When you email in, if you could also maybe send us a lottery ticket, then, you know, we make something out of this. The ones in the lead I'll never do, in no particular order, but these are the ones way out in front. At the moment it's Chris Moyles, Robbie Williams, Chris Tarrant, Davina McCall. Interesting. I'm sort of surprised at, but I. Know that's probably just been on TV too much lately. Yeah. That T shirt annoys me. Big mother, that annoys me. We don't care. We don't care whether you're pregnant or not. Loads of people have children. Yeah, I don't care. Get on with it. And Dominic Mohan. So there's that. I mean, but think of your own. There's a lot of people just coming up behind there, though. Graham Norton, he's just approaching from behind. Oh, that's the sort of stuff it's sort of like we've done satire, we've done. I mean, he's the king of the double entendre. Well, he's the king of the single entendre, but we can double it up if you want, if anyone. 104.9. This is the sort of things we're available. Go on. If any. I'm loving this. This is going to be good. I'm loving what's coming next. What? If any of the producers of Carry On London are listening and they need some new talent to write some smutty innuendo, I think we're your man. Yeah. Anyway, Carl, you better press the knob to start the record. Spunk. Ricky, I know you're a Neil Young fan. Love him. You probably won't have this album. It has basically not been available for years. It's never been available on CD before. It was part of this kind of trilogy of albums he did that were very depressing and they just been re released. This is absolute dynamite. It's on the beach. On the beach, yeah. And that's the opening track. Walk on. Neil Young, brilliant on XFM, 104.9. That's the sort of stuff you've had. Satire, a little bit of politics you've had. We said. You said spunk. Which is a bit naughty, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. And you've had Neil Young and Jane's Addiction, so I can't think of anything else I'd rather down with the kids and everything, aren't we? Yeah, Pretty hip. Pretty. Yeah. So. Oh, do you know what else? Tony Blair would just stop. Oh, doing what? Yeah, doing stuff wrong. Good, that's good. Who else is there to have a go at Peter Mandelson or someone? No, no, no. He's good, isn't he? He's good because he's gay, ain't he? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if he is. If he's not, then I'm sorry. But if he is, then well done. Brilliant. Good. To all gay people. Good. Yeah. Any underprivileged people, you're all brilliant. But people who are over privileged. Oh, do you know what I like? Go on. Foreigners, dear. All the mad they get up to, you see on the news. It's just that interesting. Is it? Yeah. Crazy. I'm going, why you doing. Why you doing that? Why? It's weird killing that. Yeah. So if you're listening and you stuff. And good stuff and. Yeah, well, yeah, you're a Disney. That's good. So. So anyway, that's the sort of satire and the way we can kind of tear apart popular culture and just get to the rain of it. Can I just leave with this mind? You know my favorite country, Africa. It is brilliant. Not strictly a country, but all the countries except the bad ones. Remember the bad ones. Oh, evil ones. Play a record. Anyone at Radio 4 is listening. Yeah. We would like to get on some kind of satire show. Cleansed. Longview and further on XFM 104.9. Richard Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilking. Yeah, yeah. The Holy Trinity. Yeah. Going well at the moment, not bad. But you're just talking about foreigns. Love them. And I'll tell you something, I've been meaning to ask you this for a while because I know you're a very well informed man. Yeah. Political and sort of liberal and that. Yeah, yeah. How does Chinese work for the language? I can't figure it out. No one knows. I can't figure it out. No one knows. It's like. It's not like any other language. No, it's not, it's. It's not, you know, either spoken or written down. Well, it's not written down. It's. It's. Well, when it's written down, it basically looks like kind of little children's drawings of those little paper houses. That Chinese people live in. Loads of them, hundreds of them, from what I can make. I mean, even French have a go. It's not even the French right words, but they've got some of the right lessons and they're going, oh, hello, how are you? And it's sort of. They're trying to do the words, but there's just something wrong. I think this is like a speech impediment. I think similar. Yeah. Germs that are going, ah, how are you? And they're trying to do the words. No effort. It's just for want of a better word. It's. It sounds. When I listen to Chinese, it sounds like gobbledygook. That is a dialect. Yeah, that's one of that. I think that's the main dialect, that Mandarin and orangutan. I mean, seriously. I mean, I can't figure out. I just. There's. I've got no grasp of how. Because it doesn't seem to relate to anything. There's not real words because there are sentences like, you know, we have a word. If we said a gentleman sits by the stream of fish. I've said it often. Yeah. We use all the different words to each one of those words. Have we got a word for each of them? Yeah, they haven't. They've just got. I think it's like a triangle with a line through it. Right. So. Which can get confusing because. Yeah. So the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. That's just. That's what I think. That's like a. I think that's like a little paper house with a feather on top. Right. But if we, if we. Personally, this is what I would love to do. I want to use the fact that we're on the radio to answer these questions. Yeah. Tell me about other cultures. I would love to speak to a Chinese person. Yeah. A Chinaman. Well. Or a Chinaman woman. A Chinaman woman. I thought it's fine. But I'd just like to speak to someone ideally, perhaps, you know, a professor of Chinese or someone who works in. A chip shop, but someone who was actually born in Chinaland. Someone born in China. Someone born in China and a Chinaman or a Chinaman woman, just to talk us through exactly what they're going on about. Exactly. And it's not. It's just because I'm very ill informed. I've only really seen Chinese people in kung fu movies. You know, Chinatown, Chinatown. Walking through Chinatown. As we've said before, not really a town. Not really a town. Novelty street. More of A novelty. A slippery novelty street. Exactly. Yeah. So, because I remember watching kung fu a lot, they always used to speak. They always. They always speak very slowly, don't they? They do. They're very kind of mysterious. Yeah. Inscrutable. They never really set. They are. They are unscrutable. You cannot screw a Chinaman. You cannot screw a Chinaman or a Chinaman. They are unscrutable. They are non scrutable. Yeah. If I was to go out in the street now and try a Chinaman. You'D have no chance. You could not screw a Chinaman for love and the money. Antiscrutable. Yeah, yeah. I could possibly screw to Chinese woman. Well, I don't think you'd have any luck. You've had. No. But anyway, if you are a Chinaman or a Chinaman woman who can just tell us basically how it works, how would you teach us the basics of Chinese? If we were going to go to China and we wanted to interact, where would we start? What would be the first words we would say? How would we say them? How would we write them? Please help. This is gonna run and run. What's the number, Carl? Oh, eight. 700. 800 1233. See, proper normal, normal talking there from Carl Pilkington. There's got to be one thing. A lot of love from Led Zeppelin. Classic on XFM104 and Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant. Carl. Phil. We've not heard much from Carl this week. We haven't heard much from anyone who can speak Chinese for us either. So we're not that one on the edge. I don't think we'll be learning Chinese today, Steve. What annoys me is I'm gonna go out into the world. Still ignorant, I know. Yeah. The only Chinese I learned was from Benny Hill. Benny Hill could speak fluent Chinese. Well, the only ones I know is you silly idiot. Is siri area. Yes. And bloody foreigners is bready foreigner. Yeah, that's all. I mean that's, that's a matter it get you by in Peking. But I mean you, you come in, you can hit a dialect and you, you know your worms, mate. Sure, Carl, yeah. We haven't heard a lot about from you but we've been going here, we've done a few features already. We've talked about different parts of the world. Different parts. Do you speak any languages? No, not really. Well, still struggling with English. Learn a few words. I mean literally about 4,000, I think. I've had a lot of emails actually, people saying, carl, please don't leave you don't want to see the show ending. Blah, blah, blah. Bringing back Cheeky Freak of the Week. And you know what Carl said? He said the bloke were on the phone, said, oh, bring back Cheeky Fruit of the Week. Can't. I don't know, you know. And he went, oh, go on. He went, well, no, I had a story today, a fella born with two dicks, but I can't do it now. Carl, you cannot not do a feature about a fella born with two dicks. We'll look if we need it. I mean, how much more have you got on the Chinese? We're done. We've done that. We've now Chinese. We've done it. That's done. That's put to bed. Fella with two Dicks. Please. No, we might get round to it later. But like I say, Cheeky Freak of the Week, sort of. We've put that on. On hold at the moment. Sure. So what have we got? What. What are you providing then today? Have you got a quiz for us? Yeah, we've got what's her name? If you want. We've got. We've got what? What's her name? What's her name? A new one. Don't know. Yeah. What girl am I thinking of? Signs of phrase coming up. All right. Monkey News is safe in it. Some monkey news that goes out. I told a bit of Monkey News. I did a photo shoot at the zoo this week and one of the people. Yeah, yeah, they told me that they used to have an orangutan, right. But it escaped. It worked out. It lifted up a drain, got out the drains and got out up into the zoo. It actually did a cold escape, right. And car goes, what happened? I said, well, they sort of like. They surrounded it and so I got it back anyway. That's no good, though. I mean, it's not monkey news unless it steals a car and goes to Spain. Exactly, yeah. Or opens a small. I mean, that's real. That actually happened. Yeah, but it's not real unless it, you know, takes a gun, gets mistaken from a president and, you know, runs. The country for three years. There was some. There's some more news about London Zoo this week about it. They're all excited because we've got a. Got an anteater in there. Right, this week. Is that good? Is that exciting? No, I think they've had an Akapi born. It's got a long nose. It's like a sort of tapia type thing. It's not interested. I said to you before about if. If an animal is named after what it eats, how interesting is it? Do you know what I mean? An anteater is the only one, isn't it? Well, get rid of them. There's lots in there. What other ones are there? Well, there's flycatchers, there's. There's lots of animals that are named after what they. What's the fly catcher? That's bear. Seems ill informed. I can't think of many beyond anteater you're talking about because you're talking about zoo though. And I watched. I was watching the news last night and it had a feature about Madame Tussauds saying that they scrapped many of the Royal family. Now, I don't mean this, but I've never understood the appeal of Madame Two Swords. I just genuinely, with no irony, cannot see the appeal of sort of having my photo taken next to a waxwork of JLo. I know, I can't compute why that would be fun. I don't know. What is it? Do they move? Because they don't move. Do they just stand there? So genuinely. I mean it's so crowds of people queuing up and people to have the photo taken. With the rules, the queue would put me off immediately. Well, yeah, I mean, it's just down the road. So you go home to your friend, you go, there's me, I. There's me with Kylie. Wax effigy. Oh, I thought you met her. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's just a wax work. Right. It's not even the real person. It I. If you've been to my entry swords, if you have any understanding of why the appeal there, email us. Let's not dis them because they might melt down Ricky Tomlinson one day to do me. Sure. You never know, you know. Yeah, yeah. So I don't want to put them. Off but seriously, I mean, I don't. I'm not, you know, Roy Kinnear might be in there. What's the appeal? Genuinely, what is the appeal? To walk around a number of life. But that's the same as lookalikes. When I see the back of the stage and it's got like, I don't know, Susan Gooding is Caprice. Yeah. And you want to go, what. What do you do with her old 500 quid. She comes and stands at your party. Yeah. And she looks a bit like Caprice. Yeah. Don't go too close. She does, yeah. It's like Caprice over there. No, but it's. It looks like. Yeah. There was One in the back of the stage which was so and so. It's Jordan and it was a woman who sort of buxom girl wearing very little buxom. Are you from the West Country? I thought to myself, if you're willing to get your knocks out pretending to be Jordan, just get them out and. Become a patiently model. Stop pretending to be Jordan and call. Yourself after another Middle Eastern country. Yeah. Don't just. Yeah, it's very odd, I know, God, Very strange. But you've got a lookalike now, haven't you? Yeah, it's so odd. But it's a bloke right sort of at his desk, right in the picture and it's David Brent. Yeah. And it's got Ricky Gervais. Yeah, I can't remember. It's just an old fat bloke with a beard. All right, don't have a go. All right, Play a record, Carl. Plenty for that Radiohead there. And go to sleep on XFM 104.9. Don't go to sleep. We've got some more fun and great tunes coming up. All right. Just to let you know that we've had a few new entrants on the Listeners Hate poll. I noticed Chris Evans is cropping up. Chris Evans has snuck in a couple of times. We've also had Jordan added to the list along with Mick Hucknell. I think that's because, Pete, you reminded people. I know I mentioned her and. Yeah, yeah. Consequently, come on, think Mick Hucknell. And also this is what I'm strongly behind Daniel Bedingfield, if you've never heard him interview. Oh, if you've heard him interviewed. He's such a knob. Is he? He really is a bit. Don't get involved. We see the good about this is we don't get involved. This is not. Does not reflect, necessarily reflect our opinions. There are people, a couple of people that are cropping up that I'm right behind but I'm not going to give that away. So don't, don't give your opinion, Steve, because then we' do, you know, I think he's a comedy genius, Chris Miles. But let's move on. Let's not. So anyway, listen, we'll. We'll be Giving the top 10 of you, the listeners, votes probably about 2:00. And then from that list, if we remember. If we remember, if Kamala doesn't lose the list. Yeah, yeah. And from that list we'll probably try and draw up the top three maybe. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so quiz time. I know everyone's been looking forward to this. Which quiz is he? Well, we're gonna play along because he's done Songs of Phrase where he cuts up bits and pieces from records. You have to guess the title or the artist and makes a well known phrase, I. E. A phrase that we've said a lot. And the challenge is that me and Steve have got to try and work out what it is as well before we tell. We will tell you the phrase. But let me just see if I can guess. Play it right. I know what that is. I didn't hear it. Can you play it once for me? I know what that is. Right, It's. Why don't they play the game of swing ball? Because that's what he said when he turned on and saw people in wheelchairs playing tennis. And his point was. Oh dear, that is so naughty. This show's been a bit naughty, I think. I don't know what's happened to us. I think it's like sort of end of term sort of madness. But I think we gotta calm down here. We've been a bit naughty there. We've said, you know, bloke with two dicks. We said Chinese people don't talk properly. Which is a little bit offensive. Yeah, know what I mean, Carl? Well, they don't know. Right, okay, let's leave it now. Okay, stop there, Carl. Carl does not necessarily reflect the opinions of XFM or any other human being. If you think that me and Steve have been defensive, we are strongly behind the guise of irony, satire, ignorance. Carl only has ignorance and hate. No, no, no. But as long as you say something good about someone, you can also say something bad about them. Go on, give us an example. Well, Chinese. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Great people. Right, good. The women. Women really good looking as young. What are you doing? I'm just saying, as long as you, you know, I mean, there's good and bad and everything. What are the old ones like? Yeah, they don't age well. What do you mean? The fellow in karate kicked. The teacher was only about 36. We started this. We started this. Oh, fact. So, Songs of phrase. Email in ricky.gervaismn.co.uk right. I have to say, Carl, this is very tricky this week. You've got some very obscure sounding songs there. Yeah, just. All we want is the artists, I think. Just the song car mate. Yeah, the artists. Just the artists. Okay, so these are the prizes this week. Let's play it again so they can hear it. Try and work out all the different artists. Yeah, why don't they play the game of swing ball. Right. Play the game on swing. Why? That's tricky. It is tricky. That is good. But there's some great prizes including Carl, I can't help but notice. Torn from the current. Well, I think today's issue of the Daily Mirror. What is giving away a giveaway? It's a free CD from the Daily Mail which you can buy it spend 30p on the mirror. You can get this anyway but it's still in the piece of plastic. Anyway, there are some other treats. Oh, you'll be loving getting that through the the door. So there's a. The jingly jangly sound of Summer. Good vibes. A two CD set featuring music from Crowded House, R.E.M. simon and Garfunkel in the Beach. I'll tell you what I've got thought of another game. We can put Carl's into theory. I can. I can tell him a sort of like a. A person or you know, a people or a place. Right. Or a profession and he's got to come up with a good and bad. A good and bad thing it is Dicing with death. Yeah. Are we ready to do this? Well listen, if we're quitting in the next couple of weeks, then who cares? Okay, Good and bad. Right. We're on the prizes here. Alright. Okay, so now 55. I know there's a lot of XFM listeners who are going to be looking forward to the likes of S Club 8 and the fast food rockers. They're all on there. I can't wait. What is their second single going to be about? The Smashing Pumpkins. This is quite a good little compilation of sort of B sides and live performances and stuff like that. Which is. Which is not bad. The best summer holiday album in the world ever. I think we've given that way in the past. All sorts of stuff on there. Plus the director's cut of True Romance on dvd. The Tarantino great film. Tony Scott movie. So there's some quite good prices. Just play it once more. So email in Ricky Gervais. Excellent. Why don't they play the game of swing ball? Just. Just the artist. Yeah, that's all we're after. Very tricky. Brilliant. Very. That is brilliant. All right, what? Let's put a song on. Bit of Farrell. Farrell Williams Good and Bad. Good and Bad Old People. Farrell Williams featuring Jay Z. That's a new single in fronting that's released on the 4th of August. It's made me sort of feel funky but in a chilled out way. Yeah, that's perfect. Do Some adverts, though, just. Oh, that would really help you. Yeah. XFM. Darkness I Believe in A Thing called love on XFM 104.9, Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Car Pilkington, Carl Set the Ball. Rolling with songs of phrase. Why don't they play swing ball? Referring, of course, to people in wheelchairs who play tennis. Because he was disappointed they weren't getting around the court quickly enough. So why didn't they play swing ball? Yeah, brilliant. Someone just emailed in saying, because if they hit it to the top, they wouldn't be able to reach it, to unravel it. Exactly. Which is a good point. Yeah. But I mean, nonetheless, good and bad in people in wheelchairs. Do you want to do that? Good and bad. Good and bad things about people in wheelchairs. Good and bad. Yeah, suppose. No, really, they take up less room in cinemas. We've got their own seat. Good. That's good, is it? That's. That's a good thing. Yeah, yeah, Good, Yeah, well done. Well done. That was bad, then. I have to think about it. Okay. But. Well, let's leave that, eh? You started it. The hate list. Can I just return your minds to the hate list? I said on the hour that we would give you basically the top five. Now, we have to stress, this is the top five most hated people that you, the XFM listeners, have suggested to us. We have not massaged these, we have not made these up. These are coming from you. Last week we began it, this week you've continued to email. So this is the list. We do not endorse this list. Some of them we may agree with, some of them maybe not, but it's the list that you have come up with. We are merely the messengers. I tell you who's coming through recently. Cameron. But he didn't make the top five. I'm afraid he was just a late. Williams dropped out of the top five. Robbie Williams surprisingly dropped out the top five. Yeah. So let me tell you now, in no particular order, this is the top five that you'll vote. Listen, when I say XFM listeners, people listen to this show. I don't. I mean, XFM listeners aren't typical radio listeners and I think our listeners aren't typical XFM listeners. Right. So I don't know what this poll, what it's worth, what any poll's worth, but, I mean, this one is probably worth very little. This is a way sort of worth less. Yeah, go on. Who's the top five in every single order? We want you, the listener, to then Just vote, email in with the one name that you, that you hate the most and then from this list we can figure out the number one. Okay, but this is in no particular order, Chris Tarrant. Yeah. Surprising entrant, Davina McCall. I don't think he's that surprising. Well, anyway, I'm not going to edit all this. No, I'm not saying. I'm saying I imagine XFM listeners pretty much despise someone like Chris Tarrant. Okay, well, anyway, Chris Tarrant's on there. Davina McCall, Patrick Kilty. Right. Graham Norton and Chris Moyles. Now, I'm not going to say anything. Those are the names that you have drawn up. There are lots of others that didn't make the top five. Richard Madeley was on there. Michael Flatley, Vorderman Bazaar. Flatley is a weird one. Very strange. So Jamie Oliver, a lot of votes for him, but he's not made the top five. So those are the top five. Just email him with the number one that you hate. And we're talking about someone. Another pointlessly named poll. Exactly. And this time we did it. Miles Norton, Kilty McCall Tarrant, it's your choice. Who would you have, who would you have in your list? Kyle, you're allowed to talk because people know your opinions don't matter. So what? I honestly don't really hate anyone. I'm not that fussed, you know, I. Mean, we're not talking so much about. Hey, we're talking about someone that. Yeah, you can't hate any of these people. All I'd done was it was pop them up on telly. But I think it's people who, as one listener, she put it. She sort of. I think she had some of those and she said, you know, I don't hate them. These are the people that, if they pop on my telly, I have to turn over, you know, I mean, it's not. You don't hate them. You do, you know, sometimes it's not their fault. It's like Davina, right. I used to quite fancy her and now because she's always on the telly, it's like I can't be dealing with her now. Sure. She's still, she's still the same presenter. It's just that bored with it. Sure. You know what I mean? Yeah. So I'm not, I'm not getting involved in it. Okay. You know what I mean? Don't want to offend anyone. Let me just give the email address. Let me just give the email address. I just said it. So, look, to walk Over. Okay, I'm going to do Carl's top thing. Ricky.jfm.co.uk that's also the email address for your answers to this week's Songs of Phrase. Play it again. Go on, tell me why, Tell me why. Tell me why. The game. I'll swing. We just want the artists. Is that right? Yeah, that will do. I've got. I've got two that you don't like. Not that you hate them, but that you sort of like, don't agree with them. Would Liverpudlians be in your list? Probably. What about gay fellas in toilets looking at you? Well, I think they've sorted that out. One of the prizes this week in Carl's goodie bag features this song. Play it like the Monkeys. Pleasant Valley Sunday. Go. Monkeys. Peasant Valley Sunday. Brilliant. XFM 104.9 car Pilkington. This show is monkey heavy, isn't it? It is monkey heavy. Carl, if you were President, would you sort of make compulsory to maybe have a little. Little monkey? Everyone has a little monkey of their own. Little chimps out, old age pensioners. It's not a bad little. It's funny, you know, because there was a story the other day when I was looking for monkey news. There's a story about a couple who couldn't have any kids, right? There's something wrong with them, but they really wanted a kid and they got some dodgy email address where they could buy a baby online, right? It was someone who would have a kid and you could buy it for three grand or something, right? Yeah. So anyway, they got one, they got picked and like, brilliant. There's the money, got the baby and everything. They were loving it, you know, playing with it and stuff. As it got older, feeding. Got airier. Oh, shut the. Oh, car. Turned out they've been sold a chimp. You. You maniac. You stupid mank twat. Don't talk. That is as if. Oh, don't talk. Are you. Are you mental? Yeah. Didn't they get into monkey? I know, yeah. That's a bit sad though. We don't like to bring. They brought each down. Yeah. And how long was this into it got area? They're born hairy. They're not born like humans. Then develop hair because they go, hold on, we better. We better get the chimp stuff kicking in now because we're in the jungle school photograph. Do I. Hang on a minute. It looks a bit weird. Oh, you are just the rubbish mad, innit? Mad mad, innit? Imagine. Oh, God, just imagine if he was in Charge. We did put him in charge of the country. Would that be amazing? Let him run the country just for a week. Or the mayor. What would you do if you were the. The president or the lord mayor of. London or the prime minister? Carl. I wouldn't do it. Like he's gonna be up in it. It's a hypothetical question, Carl. No. Well, Suzanne was. All right, meet me, Mrs. If you're a new listener, you keep her. Sure. Yeah, she was. She was watching the news, trying to follow some heavy stuff, and I'm like, the weather. I just was, like, bored. And I was reading about that mouse that had an ear on its back, said, well, you took notice of this. Should be. You know. You know what Ricky and Steve are like. They, you know, they try to teach you stuff, and you don't even want to learn. So to try and get me interested in it, she was like, saying, what would you do if you're president and stuff. Yeah. And I can't be dealing with any of it. What did you come up with? You must have spoken. What would you. What did you come up with? Did you come up with anything? I had a little. The design of it. Right. I said I'd have, like, red and blue sort of. You know, I mean, both sort of major sides into one. Well, that's broken the back of it. That's. That's pretty good manifesto so far. Anything else? What's on the second page? I had, like, KP looks after me. That would be the badges, would it? Yeah. That's good. I'm a KP nut. KP looks after me. Yeah, brilliant. That's about as far as I went with it. What would you do? What about, you know, policies, transport, crime, you know, just. Just law and order. Yeah. How would you. What would you do? How would you deal with crime? What would your initial approach be? Would you introduce guns? Should police carry guns? No. No. Would I have to worry about that? Okay, good point. No, what I'm saying is, though, I mean, Tony Blair isn't sorting everything out, is he? No, but he has a say in most things. Does he? Well, go on then. What are the problems at the moment? I need sorting out? Well, generally, how would you. How would. What's the best way to combat. Would you. Would you bolster up the prison system? Would you introduce more community service? Would you go harsher for, say. For, say, I don't know, drugs? Would you go harsher or. Or less harsh? There's. There's pros and cons, isn't it? Because, of course, You've got, you can't see to condone it. But some people, you know, you don't want to go through the court system and cost taxpayers thousands of pounds of money for someone, I don't know, difference between smoking a spliff and dealing crack. Do you know what I mean? You have to all these things. Have I lost you? Yeah, I'd just think about it for a bit. Do you know what I mean? Brilliant. You think about it for a bit. Yeah. Probably ask Suzanne. This is amazing. Get her help on it. Yeah. What about the foreign situation? Would you have supported Bush in his war on terrorism? You're aware of this war that we had recently? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, if I was new though, couldn't I just say, look, new slate, you know what I mean? Let's start again. Yeah, of course you can. I'm in charge now. Let's, you know, let's see if we can sort this out. What would you do then and see what happens? Brilliant. Suck it and see. Brilliant, brilliant. Yeah, this is excellent. Now this is. This is not really your jurisdiction, this is not really your area, but I imagine you'd have some powerful friends. You might have a say. Yeah. Would you. What would you do about single sex marriages? Same sex marriages? See, this has got Cameron. I thought Cameron had blown it on Big Brother because they said, you know, what do you think about gay fellas getting married? And he went, no. In the Bible it says, you know, a man and a woman. And I thought, oh, he's put off a lot of. I don't think many Christians tune into Big Brother, but we know the gays love it. They love Big Brother, don't they, the guys? Yeah. So interesting. But what would your take be on that? Same sex marriages. And then what? Having a kid? Well, just let's start off with, you. Know, that's all right, isn't it? Do you know what I mean? Just let him get on with it. It's not affecting anyone else. Sure, yeah, sure. All right. But he starts getting tricky, right, when you get a kid. Okay, go on. Why? Well, it's. It's just tricky in it, you know what I mean? Well, you could be right. I'm not giving anything. I mean, you know, we're not. There's no right or wrong. If you were in, like if you lived in the jungle, right, with no one else, right, and you just had these two fellas, right, looking after you, but because you've got no one else looking in on that, saying, oh, you're a bit Weird, aren't you? You know what I mean. Well, as soon as you come, why have they got married? Do you think the gay people turn to a bloke because they couldn't get a woman? If you live, if there's two fellas go away and they're in the jungle, they go, we're definitely not going to find a woman here. We might as well bum. That's not how homosexuality start. People don't. It makes you wonder. No, no, it does make you wonder. Guys don't go, well, I'll tell you what, I haven't seen a woman I fancy yet. I'll try a bit of knob. No, no, but what I'm saying is, right, if you're brought up in like a little jungle, right, yeah. How are you brought up? Someone just puts you there. I don't know what this is about, Steve. I can't be bothered go on the country. I can't be bothered running the country. Like I'm too much trouble for you. KP takes care of me. Fair enough. What I'm saying is, right, if you're brought up in a jungle, right, right. What do you mean, brought up? Just let him fall. What does he mean? Like Tarzan. You got to tell me what you mean by brought up. Wolves, chimps, What? Well, there's a good example of what I'm saying to you, right, right. What I'm saying is there's a fella, right, he's brought up in the jungle. Shut up. Just let him finish. Let him finish. There's no women about. He doesn't know about women. He doesn't understand what women are. Right, right. But another fella walks in the scene, yeah? And he gets pally with him. What does he talk about then? They've both got needs. This scenario is ridiculous. How has he lived? I don't know. What's his reference point? I can't be bothered with this, honestly. Saturday should be, you know, day off and that. Not worrying me about problems. Oh, God. KP takes care of me. Oh, dear. Elbow. Fallen angel on XFM 104.9. So there we go, Carl as president. He's still. Still confused, aren't you, Carl? Just a little bit. Just a little bit. Sort of amazed. Yeah. By the body. Yeah. You know of it, aren't you? Just the way I'm amazed how two people can buy a baby on the Internet for £3,000 and not realize it's a chimp till it goes to school. No, no, but seriously, what would you know talking about there during elbow and fallen angel. We were talking about that, I think. Yeah. If you're locked up. Well, not locked up in a room, you've got a normal life, except there's no women in it. Yeah, right, but how would that happen? What would this point of reference. How would you. Hang on. Can I just ask you something? Go on. How can infinite monkeys and a typewriter. Right again, I've told you before, right. That is not. You don't actually have to test that model. It's. It's basically a model for the. That explains the nature of infinity. Okay, I've told you before, it works because of the definition of infinity. There's no. There's nowhere in the world you'll ever be able to get an infinite amount of monkeys and typewriters to come. But anyway, all I'm saying is I think if. If you don't know about women, would you crave for a woman? When you hit sort of puberty, your hormones will kick in and you'd. You start getting urges. For what? If you don't know about it, you. Don'T have to know about it. You know when. If you grew up and you started feeling hunger, you wouldn't go, wonder what that is. You'd go, get me a sandwich. I'm starving. It's different now. It's different. But. But we're not saying it's. It's all hardwired or people are. Can't change their. Their natural state. We do it all the time. We fight nature all the time with conditioning. Body's weird, innit? Yeah, well, that's that one. I'll take that. It's weird, isn't it? There was something. Did you read that thing the other week about man with two penises? No, no, no, no. We don't need that. Lawyer who got in office, realized he was actually an orangutan, and they just shaved him, put a suit on him from Hugo Boss. And the funny thing is, he won the case. And the judge said, well, don't send him back to jungle. Let himself on his own budget. Wibble and Podge. You'd make the best judge in the world. No, there's a fellow, he's a banana. There's a fellow who's in a coma for 20 years. Just. They kept, like, taking him through, like the normal day. They take him to Alton Towers and stuff. He doesn't know anything about it. Just kept going through the motions. Don't know if they kept charging him, kept putting him through all that. He eventually came out of it 20. Years and went, stop taking me to Orton Town. How much post. Oh, did you read about that guy in the paper, Carl? Hey, sorry, on the Internet. He in about. I think it was about 1984, 85. He had a terrible car accident. But this must be it. This must be what he's talking about. Well, they didn't take him to Alton. Of course they didn't. But you've got to try and decipher the truth from the conjecture, from the thing that he. I mean, don't forget. Carl says, realizes that he's had a dream. He talks to Zan. He goes, that was good, wasn't it? Last night, we were in the plane. She goes, no, that's a dream. He goes, oh, yeah, where's my car? Flex, you got. You know. I mean, I can now decipher what he's actually seen, what he's read. Well, go on, what did you. Well, I'm assuming it's the same guy. It was a guy in some small American town and he'd had a car crash and he'd gone into a coma and his wife had left him. She'd gone on with her life because he'd been in a coma since then and he had just woken up. Marriage wasn't working. Marriage wasn't working. He just wasn't paying enough attention. He actually had. She was pregnant at the time. And so now his daughter is. Now his daughter is basically the same age as he was when he went into the coma. And he's just started coming around, he's just started making jokes. He says, they said Audrey, Philly said horny, which I thought was quite weird for a man who'd been in a coma for many years. But anyway, so he's slowly trying to rebuild what life. He can. He can. What do you make of that, though? Because the thing is that he's missed. Imagine what he's missed, Carl. Imagine the music that he's missed. Miss Live Aid, it missed Collins playing in two continents in one day. I'd be devastated if I just never missed Bross. Yeah, yeah. So he doesn't. So he'd put on ripped jeans and they go, pass. Aye. They just have to send him a series of those. I love 1986 with Kate Thornton filling him in. Exactly. Peter K. Reminding him of space operas. He remembers those. Talking rubbish. Yeah. So, extraordinary, though, isn't it, Carl? To think. No, obviously. So had he aged much? Because he hadn't had any problems or anything. No worries. Well, it probably wouldn't have physiologically. He probably wouldn't have the wear and tear of a 43 year old man because he wouldn't have sun, he wouldn't have had sort of nicotine beer unless. They were just feeding that to him. Anyway. Still. Yeah, yeah. You feel groggy though, wouldn't you? Yeah, you might feel a bit groggy. Yeah. Well, it's not, it's not fully back to normal. I mean there's some kind of residual brain damage. Yeah. But nevertheless he can form sentences. He's got no real memory so he can't remember a lot of things. It was just when I saw so giving the answers out for what's your name? Play a tune I'm bored the Snoop Dogg. Snoop doggy dog from 1993 and what's my name? Long time ago. It was indeed 10 years ago. Xfm 104.9 Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington, Songs of Phrase. We've had very, very few entries. I really think people aren't interested. They really have just given up. I mean seriously, that's the one thing. That'S the one thing you contributed to this show, Carl. And it's. It's the. The weak link, I think in the chain, the missing link. Oh, do you reckon there is one, Carl? Do you reckon they'll ever find the missing link wandering around Manchester? Wait a minute, Carl, the stats then let's have the answers if we can. Right, it was specials Play once more. All right, right, it was Play the game of Love. I think that was Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders. Right? You think, but you're not sure. Louis Armstrong was the don't mean a thing Ain't got that swing and queen don't stop me now we're having a good time. No, we're having a ball. We're having a ball. Yeah, well, I mean considering you yourself weren't entirely clear, I think it's only fair to give it to Paul Brown who got some of the answers. Right, pb, you are getting those prizes. They are on their way to you now. Okay, the stats are in for the XFM listener hate list. Some interesting results. Go on in reverse order. Okay. In fifth place. In fifth place. Interesting. Davina McCool. Yeah, I think that's just. I think that's is a reflection of being on telly all the time and running out of stuff and being over the top and. Yeah. Fourth position. Yeah. Christopher Tarrant. Okay, well, I mean that's. Yeah, I wouldn't have thought. He's the favorite there is gone second place. Go on. Graham Norton. Yeah. Is alongside in second place, Patrick Kilty, which means Chris Moyles is the winner with an overwhelming vote. And I swear to God, I have not done anything to those stats. That is exactly as they've come in off the email. We do not give our opinions on this. That was the only fair, listeners. But well done. Thumbs up, you all win a break. We're gonna play you some nice records because of that, aren't we? Reckon they sort of prefer some ads. Either's fine, yeah. Feeder. Forget about tomorrow on XFM 104.9. When I was at university, my best mate was a bloke called Wally, and he was doing psychology and I was doing philosophy and we both got into this thing, theory called determinism, which is about the state of the mind. And it's a materialistic view that everything is part of the causal web and everything has a reaction for something that happened before it. And by the way, Carl, do not confuse this with fatalism. Determinism is not predictive. It's just that if a brain state happens again. Anyway, the famous one is. Yeah, the famous one is if, you know, a butterfly hadn't shaken its wings, Queen Victoria wouldn't have sneezed. Everything's indisputably linked, right? We're thinking that and we're thinking, what if you changed one word in, like, classic songs or one note in Beit. Open Symphony? Yeah, yeah. How? It just wouldn't work. Well, I've always thought that. Come on, baby, lad my fire not as good. That sounds brilliant. Yeah. Enigmatic. Interesting. Not so good. More pedestrian if it was. Come on, baby, light a fire yeah. Just one thing wrong. Yeah, that would be great to see that. Paul McCartney comes to John and he goes, all right, John. Written a song? Well, she was just 17 well, you know what I mean. The way she looked was way beyond compare. I wouldn't dance with another. I'll stop you there. Go on, I'll stop you there. What's the matter? Something not quite right with that. Another song. It's great. Just once more. Well, listen, don't be too harsh. I mean, because we write our own songs, we can still put both our names to it. I think you're a great talent. I think you're a great talent. Listen, listen, you hippie, right, not yet. Well, not yet, but. I mean, there's a Japanese bird outside looking fancy. I'm not interested. No, well, listen, well. And I'll never change my view, right? Now, listen, right, I wouldn't dance with another. Is it that bit? I just like that Is there a different pitch? You could go, I wouldn't dance with another. You don't like the. Is it the noise? Sure. The girls are going to go crazy for it when we do that. Just. Just think of. Is there anything else you've got? I love the idea of just changing one lyric. Radiohead, well, that's their classic song. Creep. You can't really change that here. Burke. I'm a Burke. I'm a twat. I'm a knob. But don't worry about determinism, Carl. Just because it says we don't have a free will as such, you know, it's more an illusion. It's not the way. Whether we choose our choices, whether we can choose, you know, to choose our. He knows all this. But don't. But don't. As I say, do not confuse it with fatalism. It is non predictive and does not change anything. I mean, the moral upshots are frightening because if we have no free will, then are we culpable for our actions? But again, it changes something because you've got to take people out of society that are harm. Carl has often said that. All right, Carl? Am I still the President? Yeah, go on. Yeah. No, no, I'm just. Just asking him. Yeah. What would you do? What do you do about determinism? Change it. I'd have a day off. If you were President of America, would you ban guns? It's in the Constitution. Everyone's allowed to have them. I don't know. I'll have to think about it. I just love that. Imagine all your different aides and the Secretary of State and Generals coming to you. And they come out and they go. What did he say? He goes. He said he's going to think about it again. Did he say that again, did he? Yeah. What was he doing? He was on Alan over looking at Monkey News. Apparently a chimp stole a car and drove to France. Monkey News. You're talking. I'll tell you what, should we have a great song then? Monkey News. It'll be an absolute treat. A little bit of David Bowie sorrow. Yeah, didn't write this one, but, I mean, he sings it bloody well. David Bowie sorrow on XFM 104.9. Nearly there. But, you know, we're working our way up to the grand finale. The bit where Carl spouts absolute nonsense from a dodgy source on the Internet about a monkey who did something impossible. Let's queue up the jingle. Hang on. All right, perfect. Oh, chimpanzee that. Monkey News. Right, let's have a Look, this one's from. From some woman, right? Yeah. And she's. She was taking part in the London St Brighton Bike Ride, right. Lovely day, weather's good and everything. What year? She's just a couple of months ago. She's done all the training, right? Done all the training and stuff. Got a brand new bike for it, got a little puncture outfit and stuff. All set for the day, right. It's a nice day. She sets off, they all start pedaling and that. On the way to Brighton. Yeah. Right. So she knows the route and that. Got a little headphones on, cycling along. Suddenly, right, okay, I'm stopping now. If a cyclist overtakes her and it's going really fast and it's sort of hunched over, but it's got like lots of cycling gear on and a helmet and go. And I can't tell what it is, but they just know. It's like a little hairy fella who hasn't bothered shaving his legs. Which is weird, isn't it? Because cyclists usually shave their legs and this. But I. Really hairy legs, but. And it won. They gave it the medal. It won three years running. They gave it the key to the city. It had its own game show. And then someone said, hold on though, this fella's all hunched over and he's only 3 foot 5 and his arms are longer than his body. It's a chimp. If it goes anywhere near that, we're never doing it again. More monkey news next week. She's cycling. So anyway, she's cycling along, right? And this tricycle, I couldn't predict that. There's always one element you could never anticipate. Yeah, yeah. Got a kitty's tricycle with a little kid on it. Little hairy kid with a helmet. Okay, just go on in. The tricycle comes whizzing past strong legs and items. So she's thinking, that's. But didn't get a chance to see the. Oh, yeah, couldn't quite see the cyclist. You. Oh God, you bald mank. Git. Go on. Yeah. Research scientist Carl Pilkington. So anyway, she gets to the end line, right, and they got talking that said it was a nice day, nice race and all that. So did you see a little. Little thing on a trifle? Thing? A person, surely. Just a human. Did you see that? No. Did you see that bloke on the tricycle? So anyway, turns out. Yeah, well, what did you say? Things suspicious. I mean, why don't you say, did you see that fellow on a tricycle? Anyway, so it turns Out. Go on. It was a chimp. You're joking. Well, Christ almighty. There you go. Unbelievable. And he took the chimp all along. So anyway, right? So the woman's like, we're never doing this again. Checking out the news, right? There's nothing on it. She checks out XFM monkey news. Right, okay, I'll stop you there. Again, right? If it turns out she doesn't lose, right? And the circus goes, we're looking for our chimp. It used to ride this tricycle. And it escaped with police chasing it. So she listened to xfm. See if I picked up on the story. Yeah, sure. Didn't. I didn't have it and stuff. So she got in touch with the organizers of the London to Brighton bike ride. Said, look. So a little airy fella. Why does she care? She wanted to know. She thought it was a bit odd. Turns out it was a chimpanzee. They weren't happy about it because now the owner of the chimp wants to enter it into the Tour de France. No. I'm gonna die. Oh, God. In 2005. Now a couple of questions. I trust you'll be able to answer these. Oh, God. Steve, help me out. How did it get hold of the tricycle? I don't know. Okay, okay. No, that's fine. That's not an important point. That's important. How's that with you, Steve? He doesn't know that. How did it know to. Well, firstly, how did it know which way to cycle? But more importantly, how did it know there was a major bike ride? Just following the crowd. Steve, what's the matter with you? The owner of it had trained it and stuff. Aha. No, he hadn't. It had already done the run beforehand before the big day. No, it hadn't. Like I say, it wants to do the Tour de France in 2005. No, it doesn't. But there's something about animal rights. If. If they don't let it enter, they can kick up a bit of a foot. The animal rights. It's cruel to make a cheap ride of bicycle. It's prejudiced that it'll go. Is it because I is hairy, you idiot. Right, so. Wow. That is the worst. That is the worst one yet. Absolute twaddle. Absolute rubbish. Carl, have you got a tricycle? Unbelievable. Last June, from us this week, the Eels Nova Came for the soul. Xfm 104.9. Yeah, you've been listening to Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl, been a good show. Well, I hope you've Learned. What have you learned? What have you learned from the last two hours that you'll take away with you? We've. Well, we've talked about a lot of stuff. Yeah, go on then. But what sunk in? What, what, What? I'd want to know what has sunk in the last two hours? We have talked about a lot of stuff. But what will you take away? What will you learn or think about? What, what resonated for you? Probably the kid that turned out to be a monkey, right? That was. See that, that's probably up there with him right now. You brought that to the table and it's rubbish. So, next, what have you learned? Not. What did you say? Just reminded me that I prefer to watch people in wheelchairs playing swing ball. That's. That's still sort of floating about. More. More your sort of thing as well. More that you brought to the table that you already had in your head. That hasn't changed. I'm more thinking of what I did. I hit anything out of your head and replace it with something useful. Gay people being good, good parents and that if gay people had a kid, they'd be good. You obviously also are now more aware of the difference between determinism and fatalism. It was taken that way with you, I thought. Yeah. And. And the animals, you know, if they don't get their. Their rights, you know, they. They will. What will they do? Will they march or will they, like, you know, try and stand for office themselves? What do you think they'd do if you say if. If we weren't. Didn't allow a chimp to enter, you know, the Tour de France? What do you think we do? Who's gonna stop it? Do you know what I mean? Who's gonna stop that? I mean, you're asking me if I'd be president, what would I do that wouldn't be high up on the list to sort out? I say let the kid have a go. You know what I mean? Let him have a go in the race. What arm is it doing? Not a kid, though. Is he a chimp? Well, you know what I mean. Can I also just remind you of something else we've learned today? This is from the listeners. Turns out Chris Moores is a bit of a prick. See you next week.",
