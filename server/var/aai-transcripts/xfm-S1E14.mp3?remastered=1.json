Now, last week after the show, I think you guys were in the time you were in the toilet, right. Carl got out the lottery ticket that he bought. He went, I'm feeling really confident tonight. I was going, I laughed. He went, no, no, seriously. He said, look at the numbers. And I looked at him and I think they were 4, 6, 8, 20, 36, 48, weren't they? He's got. Just got a feeling about those. Aren't sure. He went, although, you know, my girlfriend said that, you know, if I won the lottery, we'd probably split up because we like such different things. Meaning she likes to travel and he doesn't. And so he said. He said. So what I said was, well, if I win, then I won't tell you. I'll just treat you a little bit more. Brilliant. That's brilliant logic. That is great. Anyway. I imagine you take care of her. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're a good guy. How would you do it, then? You just. You just sneak little gifts in slowly over many years. Yeah. You don't think she'd rumble the fact that you'd, like, don't work anymore and drive a Lamborghini? Well, I still do this, I think. What, just like as a kind of beard, as a cover story. So you'd pretend to come to work, but maybe off partying and stuff in the daytime. Clever. Now, he didn't win, okay, I phoned him up Saturday night. He went, one number. It was eight, wasn't it? Yeah, there was a lot of eights on my piece of paper, weren't they? So I think it was either an 8 or an 18 or a 48. And he went. And he. And he was disappointed. He said, waste of time. I went, well, he said, no, waste of time. He said, I've worked it out. I went, go on. He went, there are 26 letters in the Alphabet. I went, yeah. He went, think how many words you can make out of them. He went, there are 48 numbers on the lottery. I went, yeah, 60 million to one. He went, yeah, not worth it. I looked into that in the week, right? And there's even less letters in the Welsh Alphabet. They've only got 20 and yet they've got loads of words as well. So even 20, the chances, if there was 20 numbers and you had to pick six winners, it'd still be really unlikely. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you should be a mathematician. And anyway, so we got talking about it. We got talking. That was me, him and Jane around there. And. And I told Jane that he said about, oh, if you won the lottery, no, he doesn't like travel. And she, why don't you like traveling? And he went, well, I'm. I don't like planes, I don't. I'm really scared of planes and that. And she went, well, if you won the lottery, you could have a world cruise. And he went, no. She went. I went, no. He said, if you go on a world cruise, what do you do next year? It's brilliant logic, Carl, you know, on the world cruise, you don't actually see the whole world. I mean, you. And if you did, it's not like saying, well, I don't want to see that twice. It is the world. It is the world. It's a lot. It's a lot to see. Did it never dawn on you before about the numbers and the lottery? Is this. Have you been playing this for years and thinking that you had a good chance, that it was just like you and a handful of other people that. Were doing it, just as much chance as everyone else. But then when you actually sit down and think about what you're doing. He's done it again this week. He went off doing it one more time and he showed me the numbers and he went, they look a bit more healthy, don't they, what numbers you. Go for this week? All right. LAUGHING but we'll see you tonight. Yeah, go on, then. You know, people. If people do this and they win, if you take these out and people do these, you'll have to share it with someone. It's all right though, innit? Give them a chance, tell them what, to give people a clue. What numbers are you doing, Carl? No, I'm not. I'm not going to tell them all. I'll give you four. I've got. I've got 5, 9, 12 and 26. Okay. You're not gonna give us the other two? No, because that's a big difference, isn't it? Four's worth about 8 grand in it. But if I give them the other two and it wins. Yeah. What are those four numbers again? 5, 9, 12, 26. Also coming up is Carl's GCSE results. He took them in 1988, I think, was it. And we've got. We've phoned his score, we tracked him down. We've got Carl's gc. What's. What. What did I say? How many did you get rich. No clinic walking with these. Sorry about that earlier. You know I like to keep a tight slick ship and that lets us all down then it when someone goes wrong with the shoddy equipment in this place. Why don't you buy some new stuff? You must be earning a bit of money now. Wasn't. Yeah, we got a few listeners now. We get adverts, don't we? Why don't I just buy a new CD player? You can go down to Richer sounds and get one for 50 quid. Yeah, I don't know. I suppose when you're starting off, you save the money you make first before. You spend it going on recorded tape exchange. Take all the four non blondes and excess stuff you've got at the record label, you'll be able to get an OCD player. 25 minutes. This week it took the four non blondes. I think we should make that some sort of Calling to win feature. Carl, are we using the equipment that you used to use when you had Pilkies making music? The DJ outfit. I love that. That was Carl Pilkerton and someone making. Was it Colin making? Colin making Co Pilk is making music. Genius. Are we using that same equipment? Did you earn any money? I paid for the tube lights and that. I sort of covered my costs. Did you. Did they pay tax on that and then. No, that's what they got Al Capone on in. Is. Yeah, that's right. Don't worry about the music policy. We're sorting out. We got some Verve coming up. We got some Jimmy Webb, we got some Nick Cave, we got some Amy man. We got some Travis Corner Shop. You know what I mean? We're sorting our big names. We just start. We haven't started yet. We just starting getting going. We got exact Carl's GCSE result. Let's just do it now. Should we do it now? Well, let's. I think we should have a White Van man session. Oh, white van. I think people tune in for the White Van Man. Yeah, People haven't tuned in. They don't know. If people aren't familiar with this, the sun runs a column every day which is asking some punter from the street their views on the week's big events. And we just thought, why not hijack that but apply it to Carl Pilkington. Carl, I've not seen much news again this week. You've not seen much news? Don't worry. I'm sure you have an opinion on it. Just have you. Just give us it from your heart. So Gladiator okay, so. Well, on the subject of Gladiator, what do you make of Russell Crowe's appalling behavior at the BAFTAs? This is, I heard a bit about this. This is when he, he got some director or something because director producers threatened. Him because they cut his bit, didn't they? Yeah, they cut a poem that he'd done during the exception speech. I, I watched it on Sunday night. I didn't realize it wasn't live, to be honest. Yeah, but I quite like the way it was to the point and didn't mess about it was he went up, he said thanks. So you're saying that he shouldn't have beaten up the director? Is that what you're basically saying? It's a bit over the top. I mean if you didn't have time, if you really. I mean what's, what's the poem got to do with the, the film anyway? He was an awards. So do you think he's ever justified to beat up a TV director if you're a major Hollywood star? Depends what he's done. But I mean, right, what would you. Have to have done, Carl, for it to be fine for him to then beat him up? The thing is, right, forget all the beating up. At the end of the day, it was a awards thing for a film. The poem had nothing to do with the film. Yeah. So go up, collect your award for that thing and if you really, really want people to hear about this poem, it could have photocopied it, left out the entrance and said on your way out, this is really nice poem, pick one up. No, but the thing is he knew it was televised. So he knew by saying that poem once he was reaching 5 million people. That's a lot of photocopies. Do you see what I'm saying? I'm not saying he was justified. It wasn't a poem award. If it was an award show for poems, you'd say you can't cut it out. It'd be like doing the top 40 and then going number one's good, but we haven't got time for it. But it's a films thing. Okay. And he went up and he got the award for the film. Which film was it for? I don't know, but when I wanted to give you a results, I say, I said, let's give Carl his results. Steve went, no, we should introduce people to Carl again. Just remind people what Carl's like. And he's so right. I'm so glad we did this first. I'm alright, carry on, Steve. Okay. The next, the next topic. What about this big debate over whether Kylie Minoga's had a bum job. I'd have to see it. Next. Okay. What do you make of Will Young's single? He's the pop Idol winner. It's going to net record breaking sales. Apparently it's going to go straight to number one. He's had millions of copies sold. I heard last week that you had to. If you wanted to buy it from Woolworths, you had to go in and put a pound down to guarantee getting a copy. Wow. I think that's stupid. But what do you make of it though, do you think? As a song. As both as a song and do. Are you excited about Will Young and his future? No, it'll do alright. I don't think we have to worry about him. Yeah, it would do all right. It's not my thing, but seems like a nice bloke. Okay. Yeah. One final one then. What do you make of our scientists getting the go ahead to clone embryos for research? We have discussed cloning before and obviously there's the pros and cons of that. Christopher Reeve, former Superman star, he's behind this. Are you behind him? Yeah. I mean with everything. You have your good and your bad, don't you? Yeah. At the end of the day, if you don't have bad things in the world, then you wouldn't enjoy the good things. I think. You know, it's like if you didn't have robbers in the world, policemen wouldn't have a job. So it's the same thing. It's like it's an illness. Yeah. What are they messing with? It's probably a bit too detailed to go into there really, but do you. Know what I mean? Yeah. It's good and bad. You can't have it all. Yin and yang is what you're saying. Yeah. Okay, Carl, I can't argue with that, mate. I want to play a track now that I haven't heard for a while. It's the verb, isn't it? Yeah. Sonnet. Lovely song. Coming soon, those big exam results. Black Rebel Motorcycle Club Spread your love. It's time to give. Carl, you're actually nervous. I. I'm a little bit nervous. Just to recap, Carl is 30 this year. He never went to get his results of his GCSes. So myself and Steve took upon ourself to phone his school. Tracked them down and we actually got your results. What did you think you took? Did English. Right. Maths. Yeah. Art. Right. And I, I think I did physics. Okay. Well, you didn't do any of them. Me? You didn't do any of them. You didn't register. You registered for one exam and took one exam and got results for one exam. So I don't know what you thought you were turning up to or you weren't registered or you didn't. You're familiar with the notion of registering for an exam. You have to kind of officially register in order to be eligible. What do you mean, register? I turned up for a couple. Yeah. You can't just show up. You have to register for them. You have to pay this because it costs the school money. So they have had to have paid for you if they thought you were going to pass. You can't just turn up on the day and ask some paper at the front. I never got a letter telling me that. Well, that's because you were never at school. But you did somehow register or registered for one exam. You registered for history. It's a topic that you've always been interested in. Oh, I was saying to Ricky before World War II, I loved it. I mean, not the actual event, the study of it. All the stuff like, you know, about the Anderson Shelters and stuff like that and the bombs and that. And then when I took it, it had nothing to do with that. It was more about the Tudors. So it didn't. The Second World War didn't come up. You mean there was no questions about the Anderson shelters? Nothing. That's devastating. So. So what are you expecting the result to be? Is that seriously. Is that it? Yeah. It's the only one you took and. Registered, as far as the school is concerned, or certainly it's the only one that counts. It's the only result. It's the only one that counts. Yeah. You've got. I don't. Did you register for yours? Yeah. Yes, I have. Yeah. I've got certificates and everything. So what, do you do that before the exam? Do you have to go somewhere and sign something or. Yeah, you don't check your results and then decide if you want to register. It's not like Millionaire when you look at the question and go, I think I'll take the money. Yeah. But anyway, you must have registered for one or maybe your teacher put it in. You put your. Well, I didn't do it. They must have been confident. They must have been confident. They must. Thought your best bet was history. Right. So what did I get? You got an E, which. Which I think. I mean technically is a pass. E. It's a bad pass. But there's F I mean, you're not. Going to be doing a PhD. You can get an F, right, which is fail, and then a U, which is ungraded. Now, I don't know why the U exists, because F means you failed. You is like them going, you not only failed but you wasted my time. So we're annoyed that you took this exam. So thought they'd register me to get an E. They didn't. They were hoping. It was rather like you with the lottery. They were hoping for something better than you. See, I assume that the man who registered for that thought he can scrape an E if Anderson shelters come up. Yeah. Well, that's it. You've got. You've got. Now, what I'd like to do, Carl, is I've started your RE education. You've read a book on my shooting. I'll be asking a few questions about that later. I've got another book for you to read next week. Next week? I've got a little. What? Not in the mood. Oh, come on. Look. What's that? What does that say? It's that fella. It's a picture of the bloker they used to use for Citizen Smith. Yeah, Che Guevara. Yeah. Yeah. He was quite happy, I think, when he found out that Robert Lindsay was involved, he went, yeah, of course you can. No worries. No worries. Yeah. What are your feelings, Carl? What? What, are you depressed? I'm just a bit annoyed because I'm sure I turned up for more, so it just wasted me time. Listen, they don't matter. I'm sure you're doing. You're doing very well. You. You know, you can educate yourself. GCSEs are merely a step, another to help you. Not just for education, but, you know, they're more vocational than anything else. You're doing very well and you're reading books. Don't worry about it. It's not something. But if you want. If you want, I'll pay for you to take history again, Carl. We'd love to see you get a C or above. I'll pay for you and I'll get you some books. Right, now, listen, listen, listen. We can. Look, let's get. I reckon. When are the exams? June, something like that. Yeah, we're registered. We'll try and register next week and I reckon you can get an A or B in History. No, don't worry about it. It's just easy. I get you Brody's notes. If Heat magazine. They love you, Carl. They could probably sort some out. They could probably pay for a tutor. They got a lot of money, they sell a lot of magazines. I mean, it is always, almost always. And you found that out? I discovered this. It's always the Tudors and Stuarts. There's no fear for them not coming up now. What do you already know about them? You must know already. Stuff about Henry VIII and Elizabeth. No, cuz it just is too long ago to even get interested in. Do you know what I mean? You can't. Is that why you didn't do it? The Anderson thing? It was like, God, you know, I bet my mum and dad were in an Anderson shelter. You know, this is interesting, but when they. Oh, my granddad would have like, had something to do with this. But the Tudors, it's like, I don't know. Even if they had a family back then. Play, record, we come back. Hang on, hang on, hang on. Just. Sorry. No, I just. Because I need to introduce my new. The new feature. I don't know if I had a family back then. Let me just ask you now, right, if you can finish this sentence, we've got a chance. Divorce, beheaded, died. Divorce, beheaded, died. What is it? We just need to do a little bit of work, but otherwise I think you're gonna be fine. It's how you remember what happened to Henry VIII's wives. Divorce, beheaded, died. Divorce, beheaded. It's like spam support. Was it Support, Protection? Anchorage Movement. That's nothing to do with the tune. No, that's with the skeleton. Yeah, see, no, we're not doing biology and acronyms. What happened to Henry VIII's last wife? Did she die or did she not die? Divorce, beheaded, died. Divorce, beheaded. Do you know that the only king that has got a mustache is. No, the only king that hasn't got a moustache is the king of arts on the playing cards. What's the record you play? I want to resurrect the career of a different artist each week. This is an artist who's overlooked by the general public. This is Amy Mann. And she always seems to get overlooked. This was a single a while back, I think it's called Red Vines. Play it, car. Fantastic. You see, what upsets me is the way that Amy, man, she's written songs as good as that. She released it as a single. She had to, I think, put the album from which that's taken out by herself over the Internet. She was Oscar nominated for the songs in the film Magnolia. She couldn't get a record label. I don't know if she's now got one. And yet there's People like Alanis Morissette. Shifting shed, loads of songs. I don't understand what the rules are. I don't know why she's not a household name. Well, there's beautiful things out in the world. Why do you care about epoxy? Well, what did she get for history? What did she get for history? I think she did very poorly. Why do you care? See, I was gonna say this is backfired a little bit because Carl is genuinely. I don't know if he's actually upset or embarrassed, but it doesn't matter. Why does it matter? You were 15 and didn't go to school. If you were my friends, I think you would have just said, oh, we can't find them. Why? But you just wanted to know what. To do with that. Well, what do you mean? What do you mean? It's ridiculous. Do it, do it again. Because you want to learn. Because it's like there's great things in the world to learn about. Don't worry, the GCC is vocational. Is it? You know, it's vocationally for a 15, 16 year old to go on to A levels or whatever, or to get results, but you don't, you don't, you don't need that because you've done very well. You don't care about the Tudor and the Stewarts. I mean, you know, I mean, I've. Had a couple of jobs. Not this one, because you don't need qualifications to get, get a job, obviously in the radio. Obviously. The ones that I have got in the past, I did because I didn't collect them. I had to lie and I didn't, I didn't like go mad. I didn't say I had A's and stuff. But I think, I mean, I didn't put history down because I didn't even know I did it. So it's a bonus. I. I kind of treated myself to like a D and a couple of Cs and that. So it's like, well, he's not. I love the fact that car even then was honorable. It's like, I'll at least put down the ones I think I took and lie. But the ones I didn't take I won't lie about. Yeah, and. And don't give yourself a B if they're gonna find out you, like, give yourself a B next time. Backfire. I mean, my brother's a bit mental and he used to do things like go for jobs and say, oh, yeah, I've done this before, like being a mechanic. And he's never Even picked up a spanner. And yet he'd have the confidence to go and try and fix cars where. I'm not that daft, but God. And he. Who do you blame for this? That's just an easy way out. I have to blame myself. Yeah. What was the teacher like? Well, there's loads of different ones I didn't like. I mean, the history teacher, she. It is my own fault, because with her, she was a bit mental. And I used to kind of stop the lesson by saying, oh, Miss, tell us about your fireplace. You've got that is made from a gravestone. Because that's what. That would stop any interstitia in their tracks. And she loved telling you about it. Yeah, I learned that from it, too. So that's why I didn't know about divorce. Head loss and all that. Yeah, Dandruff, legs. Horse head loss, dandruff legs. But remember now, divorce, beheaded, died. Divorce, beheaded, survived. That's all you gotta remember. And what. What's that? That's what happened to Henry VIII's various. In order. In order. What does it spell out? No, it doesn't spell out anything. You just gotta remember the rhythm. In order. In order in which he married. Yeah, but it helps. It's like when my mum taught me the Alphabet. She taught me as. Like a song? No, not like that. That's how everyone else could do it and I couldn't do it that way. What tune did she do it? It was A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, E, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Dandy Warhols get off on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais, with me, Steve Merchant. Hello. It's five past two on the day that Carl, our producer, found out that he had an E in History, GCSE and nothing else because he didn't actually register. I can't believe you registered for that. I don't know, I. Didn't someone else put you in? No. They might. They can't have put you in because you were away. They probably said, oh, you know, I didn't. You didn't register in that? Listen, obviously you feel a little bit melancholy because it's, you know, it's. It's like. It's like you're hearing it for the first time, so it's like you're 16 again, but you. It was to be expected. But listen, it doesn't matter. It actually doesn't matter. But listen. But listen. Take it Again, Take it again via Justice. Is that. Is there a history teacher listening? What's the number? Oh, 708-700-800-0123. They can tell us the syllabus this year. Yeah. Oh, sorry, what is it? Oh, 8, 700. And I did. I got. I've got maths. 08700, 812 34. Mine's more laziness that I could be able to say that last digit, really. I've done the, you know, most of the work. Let's not let. If we get onto your problems, then we're going to be. It's a whole other show. It doesn't matter, really, because like you say, right, I've done all right for myself. Yeah. It's like. It's that whole thing of, like, when you get older, if you find out that your dad's not your dad, it's like, it doesn't matter. He was a dad to me. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. So are you saying Mr. Nuttall wasn't your real teacher? Give out the number again, Rick, what we after? 087-008-001234. Is there a history teacher out there that may know how we can. Is he too late to register this time? What's the syllabus this year? What's the syllabus this year? Do we have to pay for it? And does he want to earn like 25 quid cash in hand, to give Carl a couple of lessons? I'll stump that up. Take it. Yeah, be great, be fantastic. They probably won't want to do it, though. It'd be a documentary on Choice. Heat magazine be right behind it. There'd be, you know, little clues we could have a little question ask, little quizzes. You know what I mean, Rick? Before we play the next record, I've just been looking through the XFM gig guide and I just want to let you know that at Spitz this Evening, Commercial Street E1, doors at 8 o'clock. Gut bucket are playing. So I just. A lot of listeners will probably want to know that I don't want anyone to miss out on the Gut Bucket gig. It spits tonight coming from Street E1. That's a good plug for the. The Gut Bucket boys. Ladies, gentlemen, please welcome to the stage now. Steve just played one of the most beautiful records. I mean, so I've got the ante here and I'm going to play another Jimmy Webb track. I played off 10 easy pieces last week and I have played this track before, but a different version. You all Know It Obviously Better by Glenn Campbell. He wrote a lot of songs for Glenn Campbell. And this is Galveston. And this is absolutely beautiful. Jimmy Webb there and Galveston. See? And during that, Carl said, what's this about? Didn't you see? Things you're interested in? You see, if only that you're that inquisitive. When the Tudors and Stewart's came up, you'd have. You'd have a C or a B. We didn't do Stuarts, did you? It's just Tudors, they're the worst, aren't they? Stewards. I've got a lot of time for the Tudors. Can, you know, I mean, listen, right, as you know, I lent Carl part of his education, his historical education. I lent Carl Gladiator, the movie on DVD, which he watched on his PlayStation 2 and Rasputin. You know last week when you gave me this, did you know my result for history? No. That's weird, isn't it? Yep. Now, right, okay. It's the film review, Carl. You just. Just tell it from the heart. Tell us what you thought about the film. What you thought the. Can I just ask, Is this the first time you'd seen Gladiator? You've never seen it before? No. Okay. And what were your thoughts? Okay, the film review. It's all right. Nothing great. It's like. It's like an old. Sort of an old version of Rocky done in the olden days, really. Right. A bloke fighting other people. Sure. How so well known is the story. Do you reckon people know the basics? Well, just quickly just do the plot. There's a guy called Max Maximus. Yeah. Yeah. This Caesar and this Caesar's kid. And Max goes to war, sort of wins. It comes back, Caesar says, you're good at what you do. I wish my son was as good as you. So I want you to be in charge when I die. His kid finds out, bit annoyed about it, kills his dad because he don't want anyone to hear that he said that he wants him to be in charge. Yeah. So his kid gets in charge and thinks, I'll show you. You're not gonna be king. I am. You're gonna be a slave or something. And then next thing you see. Sorry, can I just stop there? My only thought is the film's three hours long, so maybe we shouldn't go through the whole plot. We've done the first 10 minutes. Yeah, go on. So, yeah, he's a slave. And then. But then that was an interesting bit that I thought. Right. I mean, I was watching this with a girlfriend. She was already annoyed because she wanted to watch Friends on E4. Okay. It was a good episode as well this week. Was it? Yeah. Don't tell her that. Okay, Right, so. So she. So she was annoying. She said, come on then, put it on. And I got it wrong straight away because it says on the back 149. So I thought that was an hour and 49 minutes. It turned out it was 149. No, I thought it was one hour 49. Yeah. But it was 149 minutes. Sure. So it overran anyway. By 40 minutes. Yeah. So anyway, the interesting bit was where he was going across the desert on a horse. And I think to show you how long he'd been going across the desert on his horse, he's showing you a shot of the horses knees and they were bleeding. And I just wondered whether that's what horses do if they run for a long time. Can, you know. I don't. So anyway, so he goes on. He keeps going on like this. He's a slave. And then he has a fight at the end with the Caesar's kid and he kills him. And that's how it ended. Okay, good. What did you think of it? Just generally. What. What bits? What do you think was wrong with it? Right. Well, I've read up on it and there's already a fact that is wrong. Right. Max. No, Caesar's kid. He didn't actually kill his dad. His dad died of a natural death. Right. In real life, you mean? Yeah. And what's. What's Caesar's kid's name? Comedian or something? Comedy. I think it's comedian. Yeah. Yeah. That's where the name comes from. When you. Yeah. Funny person is called a comedian. He didn't actually get killed in real life by Max. No, he died by his sister poisoning him. And. And he didn't. No, no. Are you saying. Are you saying that this is not a historical document? It's wrong all over the place. Yeah. Well, next week I'm giving you Braveheart. And that is actually true. That is actually. That is. That is factually accurate. It is. It is. It was a little Australian fellow that helped him out. Just for people who watched it know that the. The guy. Caesar's kid. Yeah, he died. His sister tried to poison him. That didn't work. Apparently was a gay fella and his boyfriend, who was a wrestler, strangled him. That's. Where did you get this information? On the Internet. I thought I'd look it up to see how much of it I actually got. Right? Yes. And that's what I read. Okay. So out of 10. Five. Really? Yeah. Okay. It's no good. I wouldn't. I wouldn't get it out. It's annoying the way it says, like, you know, this film's got to be seen at the cinema because I saw it at home and I don't think I missed out on anything. Very good point. I think that's the. Probably the point they're making. But yours is. Yours is valid, too. We'll play a record. And after that, I'm going to ask you about Rasputin, the Mad Monk, Travis and sing. I like that. It's all right. It's a bit. It's a bit easy. It's not their best. I like their earlier stuff a little bit better, you know, but what I don't like is them throwing around mollusks. I don't like it when that poor little octopus gets flung around. I know it's dead, but there's something. There's a certain lack of respect for the mollusk, for the squid and octopi fraternity. When I used to go to Wales for my holidays, they used to get washed up on the beach and people used to go over them on the motorbikes and they were cheering and stuff. And it's just like, do you realize what you're doing? Yeah. Sick, isn't it? But anyway, Gladiator just was going to add on the end of that. If you're into that sort of film, Jason and the Argonauts is probably your better bet. Is that factually accurate? Did you look that up or not? Did skeletons actually come out of the ground and fight you? I don't know, but it's a more enjoyable film. Okay. It's shorter. Okay, now, just moving quickly on just the last item on Carl's re education this week. Rasputin. You read a little book about Rasputin? What did you know about Rasputin before you read the book? Kyle, Could I just tell you, When I handed him this book, it was my house. He went, ah, is he the one that lived under the bridge? And I went, what do you mean? He went? The fellow under the bridge. And he had to. He went. And you had to pass him with a. With it. And Jane went, you're thinking of Rapunzel. And he went, yeah. And I went, well, that's not Rapunzel either. Rapunzel. Rapunzel's, you had to say, isn't that. You know, you had to guess the. Person who lived on the bridge was a troll in the three little. Yeah, I'm a troll, Foley. Well, so to answer your question, Steve, that's what he knew about Rust. Okay. So have you read this whole book? Can I just have a look at it? Rick, this whole book, it's about the size of a beer mat. Yeah, I'm just thinking. But did. So did you read the whole thing? No. You did manage. You didn't even do that. Well, again, some of the names in there are so long and foreign sounding, I just thought. I can't. I can't remember all these. So I just got to the meat of the story. Go on. What did you learn from. About Rasputin? Right. It was. He was a monk. Yep. And mad. He was. He a madman. Hang on a minute. Don't confuse him. Sorry. Right. Go on. God. You see, this is what happened in the exams. Right? It was. It was. Don't do that when I'm drinking. Just please, mate. He loved his women. That's how the story started off. He had really nice stories. Yeah. He had really nice eyes. And that's what everyone fell for, especially the women. Yeah. Anyway, they thought the people back then thought he had special powers because he could hypnotize people or something. Oh, yeah. And it was about a little lad who. Who had some sort of blood clot on his leg and. And he said, just calm down and you'll be all right. And people thought he had special powers, but what it was, what he was doing, he's saying, calm down. And he relaxed and it stopped the blood from flowing sort of as fast. And that's how he got better. But anyway, that's the only bit of special work that he did. And then he kept going on, and he was going in brothels and all that, and. And the people in the town thought, this isn't right. He shouldn't be going about doing this. And where'd he live? Russia. Right. Is that right? Yep. What sort of era? I thought you'd might now about 1800. All right. Okay. And then. Do you want to check that? Steve, you got the book? People. I know for a fact people got sick of him. And. And they said, oh, we'll have to get rid of him. So they tried to. He loved cakes as well as women. Okay. So they said, let's poison a cake. And they poisoned a load easier than poisoning a woman. And he had these cakes and it just didn't kill him. And they were like, God, what's going on? And they kept giving him more and more cakes and he was suspicious and that didn't work. So the fella said, ah, sir, I'm gonna shoot him. So, Well, I imagine it was the end of his tether. So, I mean, he was back and. Forth to Mr. Kipling's, you know, shot. Him once and that didn't work. And the fella thought, oh, my God. And he started running away. And Rasputin's running after him and he shoots him like another. I think he took four. Face full of Battenberg. Four. Four bullets. Who's gonna swear then? Four bullets it took to kill him. And then this fella who was after him chucked him in an icy lake and that was the end of him. But I don't understand, sort of. What do you understand, Carl? Well, the fact that, you know, he's a bit of a name in history. And I don't understand why, because it just sounds a bit like me brother. Does he love women and cakes? And do you think that'll be his downfall? Right, I want you to study, right? If you want to do. That's the first introduction. If you want to do some extracurricular, There's a song by Bony M that lays it out. Suzanne told me about that saying about Russia's greatest love machine. Yeah, but it didn't say anything about cakes. No, I think if you get the 12 inch according to Bony M, and I don't know who's. Who's correct, the bloke wrote that or M, they put some poison into his wine. Now, I don't know if M have done their research or whether. Yeah, they did suit him until he was dead. I. Paul was the greatest love machine in Russia. Again, I don't think it says that in the book, but M might know more than that fella. So what's your final verdict on Rah Rah Rasputin? Just. Just a normal bloke who didn't have that much luck, really. You know, that's what I don't understand. I was waiting for something special at the end, but just a normal fellow, really. Yeah, just an everyday. Happens all the time, didn't it? Just an everyday mad monk. Yeah, just everyday mad monk. You have to shoot and poison and throw in icy legs to kill him. And who loves women and cakes. I mean, come on, do we need another one of them? Boring. What would you say about him then? How would you sum him up? I think you've done it. I think you've done it. So next week, Che Guevara. You gonna read the book? I don't know. Come on. Next week's Che Guevara Take it home. There he is. Coming over. Nice one. Good luck. With your next, sugar babes. Are freaks electric, are they, Carl? You know, I feel like. Feels like Christmas Day when you didn't. Get the gift you wanted. Yeah. Do you know that, like, anti Climax. When you've been looking forward to it for so long? Yeah. You know. Well, I mean, I knew you were looking forward to it. That's why it took you 14 years to get the result. And then it was two other people that got them for you. Do you wish that we hadn't done it? No, it's all right. It's all right. What's your girlfriend gonna say? I don't think I'll see her again. She likes a man who knows about the Tudors and Stewarts. Does she? Yeah. First Gladiator. Yeah. You've been bluffing whenever she said, what is it going to do? To go good, like, lots of things. But look, it's a bird. What happened to Henry VIII's last wife? Or. Oh, wouldn't. Oh, yeah. Oh, look, Friends is on telly. I just changed the subject by saying things like, you know, about the. The only king in a pack of cards. That threw off the scent. They threw us off the scent. That would. That wouldn't fall an invigilator, would it? That's the thing. You can't use that one with an exam board. Carl, have you ever logged on to Friends Reunited? It was the site that everyone was talking about last year. No. Are you aware of the concept? I've heard about it, but there's no one from school I'd want to hook up. So basically, for those who don't know, you have to log on to his website and then you can help. It helps you track down your old schoolmates if they've also logged on and stuff. And we took the liberty, really, of looking on the Friends Reunited site and typing in your school and trying to track down any of your old mates. We didn't get in touch with any of them. Don't worry, we didn't do that. We're not going to surprise you with them now, but I was just interested to know, like, some of your thoughts on some of the names that I could run past you. I mean, these are people from your year. Just tell me if you recognise the names. Alison Birch. I think I remember. What's your thought? What's your thoughts on her? Don't be libellous. Don't be like, no, no, Posh. Probably did pretty well in history. And that Sarah Morris. God, yeah. Remember? Go on, you're grinning. What's the thought? Go on. No, just. She was alright. She was a popular one. What does that mean? She was nice. Yeah. Okay. Okay. What about Darren Buckley? He was. He was one of my best mates. Was he really? Yeah. Seriously? Yeah. What do you reckon he's doing now? Do you still keep in touch? When my mum and dad were still in Manchester and they had a body shop, he used to go in because the bookies was next door. I love the way he paints a picture. If you do this in your history exam, Carl, you will walk it. Go on. So your parents had a butty shop. There was a bookies next door. Yeah. And he liked having a bit of a gamble, so he used to. I think he works for some insurance company. Do you think that his fiance Beth knows he's got a gambling problem or that his two year old son Louis. No. Yeah, they live in Cheadle Home. He must be doing well. He's still supporting the Blue army and frequents the shrine on a fortnightly basis. Funny thing with him is, right when I used to stay over at his house and his dad was a copper and I remember his dad came down and said, right, I want to see you two. I was like, oh God, what's happened? And got us around the round the table. He said, do you know much about drugs? So we were like, what's all this about? So he goes, you know, they're not good for anyone, you know, stupid thing to get into. And we're like, yeah, we know. And he went, you know, do you? He said, yeah, he said, what's this then? And he'd found something in his bedroom and it was a skittle. What the sweets? Do you know, little sweets with the S on it. Oh, really? Drugs? Yeah. So he said, well, yeah, it's a skittle. Yeah, I know what it is. Oh, he's bluffing. Like that as a slang word. Yeah, he thought, he thought because he was a copper he probably had to be down with all the terms and that. So we said, oh, it's a skittle. And he said, yeah, yeah, I know what it is, but what's it doing in your bedroom? It was like, no, it's a toffee. Yeah, I know it's a toffee, it's a squib. It's a. It's a. Yeah. Carl, more people from your past. Debbie Carr. Yeah, she was, she was another nice one. What does that mean? Is that a euphemism? No, she was one of them that you'd sort of go, she's nice but she'd never be your girlfriend. Do you know what I mean? She was really. Even though she was in the same year, she seemed a lot older. Right. It wasn't a teacher, was it? There was three of them who all hung together and they seemed to hang around like the older kids, the ones who look like men. Do you know what I mean? What did you look like then? Well, it's just that I had youthful sort of looks, whereas like the older ones had like beards and stuff. It's a gang of boys in the fifth one with beards. Were they smoking pipes? Come over here. Me Philly. Oh, you. Oh, Debbie Car. Come over here. Little beauty. She was like, I love that. Hanging around with beards. There's the big boys fishing. Lovely beards. I just see a whole row of George Bernard Shaws. How do you do in history? Boy, they got an E. You're an idiot. Oh, they were like, you know, I'd be there sort of playing punching people in the arm because that's a great game. Oh, I love that. Punch people in the arm. Is that part of the Olympics though? It's. I think it was exhibition this year. Right. But it's gonna be a pro next. It's gonna be the Winter Olympics because you've got to do it in just a cap sleeve shirt in winter. But. Yeah, so you're playing that. She. But whilst I didn't appreciate that, she used to go, ow. I always think whilst I was doing that, they were like the Charlie's Angels and they'd be sorting out a mission somewhere because they were really like. There was something about them. They thought, you know, they were private detectives. What do they work for? A man they never see. Okay, well, here's a name I'm interested in because. Well, let me just tell you the name first. Adam Clifton. Oh, God. What are your thoughts on Clifton? He was one of them kids. He was alright, but he had that thing when if you didn't have enough milk, he had like wrinkly hands and white bits in his nails. Oh, because he didn't have enough milk. Therefore you didn't like him because you didn't get enough milk. This is not to be confused with the two people with the big heads and the webbed feet. Is it Webpunk? They weren't related. They must have been somewhere along the evolutionary sort of trail. Do you know what I mean? They must have come from the same sort of stock. But you wouldn't have liked him. He's just one of them people. He was all right, boy. Well, before you say anymore on Friends United, you can leave a little message which explains what you've been doing and what's what you said. You know, your life's like now. And most people leave maybe two paragraphs. Adam. I've printed it off. He seems to have printed, I think there's about six pages here of stuff. He keeps updating it and he just basically lists his memories about everyone. Okay. The school and what he thinks of everyone. And he says, I often see Simon. Da da da da. He's doing all right for himself. Self employed illustrator, Mark Cooper. Carl Pilkington. And your name comes up. Now, I don't know if you've told us this story. I think you may have done, but I can't remember the facts about it. It just says Carl Pilkington with his pet bird. Was it a magpie? I can't remember. He brought it to school to show everyone and it flew. Oh, God. Oh, no. They do that, don't they? What was the story? You give them seed and they just leave. What do you mean? This sounds like Kez. Well, that's it. I was a big fan of Kez. It was the time our dog had just died. Yeah. So I didn't have any pets and the cats were always getting run over. Yeah. And so we didn't want any more pets. Yeah. But there was a magpie that used to fly about on the estate and I managed to. To sort of tame it and in. The end with a chair and a whip. What do you mean you tamed it? Well, just used to sort of hang around it and talk. How'd you get hold of it? Did you catch it? Well, eventually, yeah. It used to just come to me. And the annoying thing was it got to a point when I wish I hadn't bothered because it used to pop me bike tires. It used to sit on like if I was talking to me mates and I was on my grifter. I love the way he just throws things in. It's like an allergic Alan Bennett play. It landed on me tyre and it used to peck at the tire and pop it and then it used to then never go away. So it was always like around the house and my dad said never bring it in. So he used to sit on the porch and I used to go out and it used to fly down and land on my head and it really hurt. It used to like peck and stuff. He thought it was a tire. So it wasn't so much Tamed as a stalker. Oh, God. So you took it to school and it flew away? Yeah. So did you take it in? Proudly going, look at my magpie. Oh. I think it got a bit confused in the area that it was in because I used to just keep it sort of around our estate. But sure, the school was a bit of a distance away. How did you get it, though? Carrying it on my finger. Did you walk? Yeah. Wow. So it was happy there. But it used to be one of those things that people would stop me in the street and sort of go, oh, what's that? And I don't suppose he called it Maggie. You didn't get Charlie's Angels to go and find out what happened to it. Investigate. Were they impressed? No, not really, no. But go on. Any. Any car. Let's come back to me. Let's come back to it. Let's have a hip hop Hooray track. It's the big hip hop selection from Big Steve Merchant. I don't know why I'm talking about that. Just trying to sound hip. This is Spearhead, from many years back. A track again, I think, got largely overlooked at the time, but worth hearing again. People in the middle. Spearhead. People in the middle. Michael Franti, surely one of the greatest rappers. I think he's just. If you've ever. If you've ever heard him bust it live, Rick, he's almost as good as me. I'm just gonna tell the. The listeners there, Carl, this is quite a little insecure sort of chat. And he was just worried about that last bit. He's going, who would ever find that interesting? He was worried about people finding him bullshit, boring. And Steve said, as I said, you know, it's. It's like Alan Bennett thing. He went, yeah, but, you know, no one would care about Alan Bennett if he wasn't such a hit maker. They wouldn't care what to say. And we just looked at him for a while and he went, ah. Thinking of Tony Bennett, bless him. Listen, it's almost the end of the show, Carl. Yeah, it's really been a Carl special. This is a car special. Next week. Next week. We have to. We're not gonna. He wants to retire a little bit. Just. Well, those old lottery numbers might come up tonight anyway. What are they again? What's the four you've got with? Put them away now. What? Come on, we'll give us all six. No. Why, Carl, while you're rummaging for that. 5, 9, 12 and 26, a few. More names that you may recall from Friends reunited. Go on. Lisa Shufflebotham, do you remember her? Yeah, she was. She won the Charlie's Angels. No, no, she wasn't that nice. But she wanted me, her and her mate Rachel. I remember. I don't know why, but it was some sort of PE lesson where it had to be a bloke and two girls and they were fighting over me. Could you hear what they were saying? They were just like, I want him and I was loving it. Stuck in the middle and they were fighting over me. And then the next week I thought, I'll sit near them. What sort of games do they play at this school? That's an incredible game. But I think Punch me on the arm. No, punch me on the arm, Carl. He just went through it because the following week I thought, right, I'll sit near them again because I quite enjoyed the way they fighted over me. But then they picked somebody else and I don't know, I always with that week. So you didn't. Didn't get any action with Shufflebotham or a friend? No. And when she got older she went a bit off. She's probably nice now. It's just. I mean, I'll say about myself, when. When you get to sort of the end of secondary school, you do sort of go a bit odd looking. Right. Do you know what I mean? When you sort of. Ed grows funny. I would just love to go back to his school of that era. I mean, just what happened to people, whether, you know, all people sprout in limbs. When you're like 12 and that you're quite. No, not 12. When you're 10. When you're 7 to 10 you sort of look healthy and you look at your pictures when you go, yeah, I was a good looking lad. But then when you get to late secondary school, something happens and you just look a bit odd. Okay, well, what about Alison Thorpe? Not sure about her. I sort of know the name. Can't put a face to it. Damien Comer again. Know the name. Can't remember anything. No. It's a shame. Well, those are pretty much all the names I could find. We've had some interesting thoughts though, and interesting anecdotes. Yeah. Anyone in particular that you'd like to say hello to that maybe listening now that you. No, I think I would have mentioned Darren Buckley if you hadn't brought him up. He was like me buddy. Yeah. Did you ever see the Magpie again when you took it to the school and confused it? No. You're joking. That was the end of it, was It. Yeah. So where did it go? Probably to some other kid because, I mean, actually it probably got killed because if. If it was being that friendly with other people, some people might have took advantage of it. In what way? Well, there was a program on the other week about. In the way that shuffle. Both of them are trying to take advantage of you. There was a program on the other week about bear whisperers. Yeah. And some blokes got really friendly with a bear and then when they were leaving that area where the bear was, they said, oh, we've caused a problem here because there's some bear hunters coming in and moving into this area and it's going to get a bullet if it acts like this. They had to scare it away. And that's what I should have done with. With Maggie. I should have terrified it a little bit so it wouldn't trust humans. Just introduced it to some of your schoolmates, I'm sure would have freaked it right out. Were the ones. Maybe that was why it fled. It didn't see. It didn't see those two fellas with big heads and webbed hands coming towards it, did it? That would have terrified anything. It's like a scarecrow. Like a two walking scarecrow. Listen, have we got time for a song for the ladies? What's happened? We've not really thought. Just do it. Just do it. Thanks very much. No, no, we haven't lined anything up, have we? I was going to play Mary Lawson and that for you and then. Is this going to be the final track? Absolutely, yeah. It would be, yeah. We've blown it. We've blown it on the Carl special. We have indeed. I'll play it next week. So Carl there's got an E at History in gcse. Any history teachers, anyone who can help Carl out? I think we should try and register him and take it this June. So. So what's your homework for this week? You've got to read about Che Guevara, haven't you? The revolutionary leader. Yeah. Okay. Do you know anything about him at all? Have you got any basis? I just know that if you want to use his face on your business, it costs a lot of money. Do you know like, if. If McDonald's wanted to have him as like instead of Ronald McDonald's. How does he do it, Steve? How does he do it? Listen, just play a final record, Carl. Say goodbye and we'll see you next week. All right, See you later. Cheers, mate.",
