Not like that. I mean, we were taken aback. Speak for yourself. Yeah. And we've got guests. Jonathan Ross won and he has guests. So we're gonna have guests in, one of which is sort of a tie in. He's going to explain himself. It's Dr. Fox, Dr. Neil Fox popped in for a chat. It's a pre record. We've got that. Although live in the second hour, we're gonna have a chat to the girls from Tattoo upstairs at the moment in Capital and they're gonna pop down and have a little chat with us. So we're really trying to, you know, make this more of an interactive show. We don't know yet whether we're gonna give up or not. It depends how this show goes. Yeah, look forward to that. But we got some great. We went down to the big library so we don't have to rely on four non blondes and the, you know, the two jam tracks that are up here. We went down to the big library and we've got some great tracks, Steve, haven't we? We've got some classics. Should we play one now? Well, before that, I just remember that some of the criticism we received, I think, was that we're perhaps not taking into consideration the listeners. A lot of shows, a lot of radio shows, they cater very much to the community, to the area which they're broadcasting. They interact with. With the fun in that. I agree. Well, for me, really, I'd just like. To justify why we don't tend to correspond or interact with the listeners. Here's a typical email from Vicki, age 25. She asks, do you ski, Rick? That's her question. Do you ski? Yes or no? No, I don't. No, you don't. Right, there you are. Thanks, Vic. Brilliant. Keep those coming in. See, now he's turned him against us. Carl, what do you think? Karl, what do you think of Steve's attitude there? Black Grape Cut his heroes next. FM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais, with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Okay. Proper, proper radio. As you know, we're a bit gutted that we won nothing at the Sony Awards. We found out that on the panel was Dr. Fox, probably one of the greatest DJs in the world. One of the great Living broadcasters. I certainly think that he's up there with Tarrant, John o' Coleman. And so Gregory, Chris Moles, we asked him to two is also on the, you know, Pop Idol panel. So he can make and break people. So we asked him basically to explain himself. Why did we win nothing? Why were we so bad? This is what he had to say. The award guys was called the entertainment Award. Right? Now, in itself, I think that should probably tell you something about what should be on the tape. There should be some entertainment. And it just wasn't very entertaining, actually. I don't mean that sounds quite horrible sitting here in front of you now, but it. It just wasn't very entertaining. But fundamentally, what. What elements did you not find entertaining? The fact that it didn't seem entertainment at all. It's part of it. I mean, it's a bit of a like hell onto a piece of string, isn't it? What is entertaining? I've talked about string on the show before, though. There were loads of people I'd never heard of in my life. And some of those were perhaps a bit more entertaining than you. The people that got silver, I think they were called Joe and Twiggy. They worked for a station in the Midlands, I think, Trent fm. They were actually pretty funny. Funnier than arse stuff. Yeah. What? Yeah, they were actually. Yeah, they were funny. And they seem to say. Seem to sort of understand their local. They seem to understand their market a bit more. Then I got onto yours, I think. Oh, great. Riggy Gervais. Yeah, he's really funny in that program, isn't he? I must watch that. I'm gonna absolutely die laughing here. And. Oh, God, it was painful. How would you have improved it? Just listening. Bit of humor. Be quite a good bit of humour. Essential things for an entertainment show. A bit of prep, you know, so get in there and actually think about what he's gonna do, perhaps. Right, okay. Well, thank you, Dr. Fox, for your honesty. We've got to the bottom. While you're here, can I just show you this? That lump. Do you still do prescriptions? Dr. Fox There he was. You know, he's honest. He was blunt. He was blunt. You know, he. You know, I'd like a second opinion. I only do. And he's not actually a doctor. Well, he used to be called Dr. Fox and now he just calls himself Neil Fox. I think he's been struck off. No, He's Neil Fox, MD. Right. He's just. I wondered if there was some malpractice that something, I mean, was under and he sort of went a little bit crazy. Just leave it there because Froggy will not take that lightly. Who? Froggy? What do you mean, Froggy? He's Dr. Frog now. He's changed it to not Fox. He hated Fox. But are we gonna heed his criticism? Because it was about. There was no preparation, we weren't funny. Fair enough. There was just really no content. We didn't care about. We didn't care about the show, the. Demographic we were meant to be aiming at. Just sounds like a lot of work, all that. Well, I think what we can do is we can take all on board and immediately forget it and carry on because it's easier. What about that? Brilliant. I'll tell you what we could do though, Play some bloody great tunes. Thanks very much. Athlete. You got the style on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. And it. All right, Brilliant. Well, you know, the funny thing was the. The day of the Sony's, the Rajar figures came out. That's the body that tells exactly how many listeners you've got, etc. And XFM went down a little bit across the board, except one show, Steve, that went up 34%. Keep talking. Well, what show do you think that was? I'm trying to think. Would it be Zoe Ball? No, no. Christian Connell Breakfast Show. It was this little mother of a show, really. Up 34. Everything else went down. We went up 34. Yeah. So maybe Dr. Fox should be listening to those figures. Indeed. Yeah. We get a pay rise. Will we get a 34 pay rise, Carl? Oh, up to 80 quid a month. For the last like two years. There's been nothing there. And you've still been getting the same money, haven't you? That's the way it works. There's been what, though? You're not paid per listener, are you? It's just. You know what I mean, it seems like it. I think maybe it's given us five pence. Exactly. I went along to. I came in from the presenters meetings. This stuff. I've never met one before. A presenters meet. I didn't know they existed. And I just came into a noi car. It was about five to six, so I was gonna get him as he knocked off. We're gonna have a. Sorry. And the presenters meeting is what? That's where they dish out which amusing news stories they're gonna read out, is it? Yeah. They don't know what order they're gonna play. Athlete, Coldplay, the Vines and went upstairs and. Quite interesting, wasn't it, Carl? Yeah. You know why the figures went down a little bit? Come on. The war. Is that what they said, the war? Yeah. One point I said to Carl, just how many listeners died in this war? Because I thought he was saying that they were at the front. Yeah. Or XLM listeners went, well, I'm going. Yeah, I'm going to Iraq. Well, the reason our list. Tell Zoe to tape it for me. The reason our listenership went up is that that just tells you who's listening to us. Cowards, yellow bellies, children, women, people with faul and arches. Terrorists. Oh, dear. Yeah, I didn't, I didn't. I. It was quite a good meeting. Now, I saw some. So what exactly? Is there anything I missed out on this? No, no, they just, you know, it went, it went down a little bit except our show, which went up 34. Up 34, remember that? And then you went out. You went out afterwards, didn't you? Yeah. Went to a bar to have a couple of drinks and that. Yeah. And then a few of them went on to onto string fellas. No, they didn't. Well, some of them did. Zoe. Did Zoe and you know, a few of the office people and that. Yeah. To what? To watch lap dancing? To beat? Well, yeah, that's what goes on there, isn't it? I know it's mad in it. Have you. I've never been to string photos. I don't know one, but. No. What, why, why would they. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I was talking to people about it the day after and they said, oh, you missed out. I said, well, did I? So how does it work? They said, well, you know, you pay. Never quite understood lap dancing. Never quite understood. It was, it's, it's basically someone dancing naked, rubbing their ass in your face. Yeah. That's basically the gist of it. Is it? But you, but you can't. The rules is you can't talk. Do they do a home service? I just think it's just, it's nearly. I've got to be careful. I say it, but it's sort of, you know, I'm not dissing string fellows or anything, but is that not sort of like one step down from prostitution? That is such an antiquated. What I mean, 19th century. No, but I mean, what, what it's like, it's, Well, I don't, I don't quite understand it. I, I. I don't get it. Because the thing is, I said, how does it work. They said you pay 20 quid, you get some clean money. Sort of like little vouchers that you stick in the knickers or whatever. Oh, God. Clean money. Yeah, disinfected money. Okay. I just like vouchers. Can you put loose change in there? Because I love that I owe you. Yeah, 20 quid it is. Right. And I. I just don't get it because, I mean, I'm not. I'm not tight with money or anything, but. No, you pay your 20 quid, they dance in front of you, but you're not allowed to touch, which to me is like going to a restaurant ordering a nice big warm dinner, and they put it in front of you and it's like, well, you can't eat it. And you're saying, but it's going cold. I love the idea of some bloke sitting in string fellows, businessman, right space, £50. There's an ass waving his face and he's going, can I not just. They go, don't. Turkey goes, it's going cold. Look at it. It's going cold. Oh, that is brilliant. It's going cold. I mean, see, Carl in the week was saying that he doesn't like sayings and phrases and metaphor and analogy. And I was going, you know, and he thinks it's sort of like, you know, one step away from poetry, but he comes out with the most evocative phrases. That. That is a straightforward analogy. Lap dancing is like being given a meal that you can't eat. See, that's. That, that's great. That's how you saw it. And that, that, that's so much better than saying it's. It's mad, you can't touch or it's a waste, or. You see what I mean? I was, I was trying. We were trying to inflame his enthusiasm in the week, and I said about different phrases and that goes, well, why don't I just say the actual words? I was going, well, it's more poetic. And I told him, the Isaac Newton one, if I have seen further than any other man, it's because I've stood on the shoulder of the giants. And I said, well, that's because, you know, he's saying, I'm getting lauded for being this great scientist and all these discoveries and being a genius. But I'm saying, you know, if it wasn't for those scholars before me that come up with what they come up with, you know, I wouldn't have got this far. Carl went, what did you say? I just said, well, I prefer him to give me a name check. Do you know what I mean, though? If he stood there and he's saying how good everything is, don't just class me. Don't sort of put me in a load of other people. Give me a mention. If you're one of the other scholars. Yeah, yeah. I think there are probably people that died sort of years before him. I think he's saying more that he's thanking the body of work these scientists and these great men had handed down, you know, through either books, material, teachings. He's not giving a big shout out to the collective science posse. Yeah, yeah. You know, thank you. Actually, I copied Nigel's. He's not saying that. I was like earwigging. I heard what Nigel said about it, about the third law. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. I mean, I look into sayings and stuff. Go out more and see if they were. Well, one. One. That happened a couple of weeks ago. Right. You were talking about the. You can't. You can't have your cake and eat it. Well, I never understood that because I thought, well, what's the point of having your cake and not eating it? Rather like your lap dancing analogy. But it actually means you can't have eaten your cake and still have it there, obviously. Well, the time that I saw that same work, right, I was. I was in ASDA with Suzanne. Yeah. And you know those big binders you get with nice cakes in them? Yeah. For birthdays and that you can get one with like David Beckham on the front of it. Yeah. Another one with, you know, Thomas the Tank Engine. If you want Ricky Gervais. Yeah. You can have one of them. And I saw one of those comedy ones where it is like a big pair of breasts. Yeah. And that is when you know you can have your cake and eat tit. Play records. No, but you see what I'm saying? Play record. There we go. I want to talk to you about it. About pants. Just. XTC and senses working overtime in the present climate. They should be happy with the work on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl, you're poised there. I know what you're dying for. I know what you're dying to do now. You're dying to play some adverts, aren't you? This picture with the androgynous vocal talents at the helm there of Brian Maloco on XFM 104.9 broadcasting. Excellent. Did you see? I think I'm Sure. I don't know if Kyle saw it. I know you watched it. Rick the Extraordinary. It was a Sky one TV show the other night. It was something like reality tv I think it was called. Yeah. And it was about basically what the. Fortunes cannot get enough of it. The fortunes of various reality TV stars since they've come out of the show. Christine Hamilton coming out of the jungle. And obviously, once again, always a pleasure to find out what fats were. Waller is up to. Rick Waller, I mean, he's got his own band. He was playing in some club in Rochester. There was about 20 people in the. Sort of gospel rock, that sort of soul gospel rock thing. Like somebody seeing in. In the commitment to summer. And. And when it cut to the audience, it was like it was in Butlins. It was just a big dance floor. There's just people watching indifferently. And he went. The people that were here loved it. I mean, it's tough to say the. Size of the man. His leather jacket, Carl was extraordinary. I don't know how many animals had to die to make it. It was like, you know, it was. If he'd have fallen off, it'd been like the Hindenburg. Yeah. Because it was like a Zeppelin. Oh, the humanity. I still think when I see him wearing a coat like that, it looks like he is stood on the shoulders of two other people and it's just a joke circus act or something. Yeah. Because his head doesn't make. It doesn't make sense. Looks like it's one of those things that you steam yourself in. You put your head out. That is. Is that a machine you're in? No, it's a. One of those old fashioned iron lun. Oh dear. There were some magic moments, but there. Was a grind because once again, I mean, I missed a lot of the first series of I'm a Celebrity. Get me out of here. But it showed once again, the moment with Darren Day. Darren Day, lovely guy. But that moment where he went off and sat on a rock and came back and he'd written a song. I know. Which he just. And I came. It was also. It was also things like I'm in a hotel room in another town. Okay, don't. And it was just. It was like something you'd write when you were 14. It was unbelievable. They showed it again. It's just stunning. I love it. Songs you Write when you're 14. It's like your first sort of like song, you know, three chords. And it's always. It's always stuff like there's a man, he's a lonely man. Take a look at him. He looks a bit like me. Yeah, it is me. It's that sort of thing. Like, we want to play with someone and they. You want them to go, my God, you're deep. Yeah. My God, you're brilliant, aren't you? And that's about you, is it? I have to say, this is such a terrible confession. When I was doing a school play once, when I was about the age 15, right, there was a girl who was in the cast with me, right? And she sort of, you know, she was giving me the eye. I was thinking, yeah. Well, I kind of thought she was right. And it was glass. But there was another guy. There was another guy there as well. I was sort of competing for her affections. Oh, no. And he was quite witty, guys. His name was Scott Hanson. He had long blonde hair. Exactly. Yeah. And. And I thought, well, a way to impress her. Because I was 15 or whatever, I thought I was pretty smart. I sat in one of the adjoining dressing rooms reading a copy of the philosophical book Zen in the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, which I didn't understand. But we also sat there reading it in the hope that she would walk in. Think, my God, your readings. Anything out of motorcycle maintenance. You don't go with the crowd. You don't want to come next door where we're talking about nonsense and people are flirting. We're talking about the Bangles. Yeah. You're in here saying, look, just. If you want to come and talk to me, you're welcome, but I'm a thinker. I bet you thought you were Kwai Chang, didn't you? I thought it was like she'd think, jesus Christ. I know. I've never met anyone like him. That is Jesus. I remember the one time she accidentally walked in. She went, oh, oh, sorry, wrong room. And left again. And that was it. Sorry. At 15. So this is about the time you took to wearing a bow tie to impress people. Wearing a bow tie. I love that. No, I used to watch a lot of Harold Lloyd films, and he always seemed to do very well. I love it. I love the idea you're going, well, it's time I went to wooing. Right, right, on with the bow tie. Where's the Zen? Where's the pipe in my boat? It's a dime. I got me a bow. Yeah, I love that. But songs are great as well. The other. The other thing you do so when you're about 15, 16, is start writing songs about, like, the world's trying to take a piece of me. Hey, you think I'm going down, I'm coming back, I'm against the ropes. They try to drag me down. It's like, you want to be cool? I'm Luke. Yeah. They put me in this emotional prison. The man's on my back. Who? Who? They. They try and take a piece of me. Who? Who, who do. Wow, you're 14. Parents and that. They don't know. You're really comprehensive, the teachers. Yeah. I absolutely love it. I still remember a poem. I like to say his name. We're about 14, 15 and this. We had to write a poem and obviously everyone's was pretty rubbish, but we mercilessly took the piss out of this bloke because I still remember the poem and how he did it is he went through a dictionary and found things with it and I. This is. This is a poem, right, OK. I've remembered this for 25 years, right? The reason why, the reason why the reason why I had to die Did I bleed the blood of greed? What was my destiny? And when we hear this, we were laughing. I mean, for a year we would go, what was my destiny? It was just great. I'll hear it again. I enjoyed it. The reason why, the reason why, the reason why I had to die Did I bleed the blood of greed? What was my destiny? Oh, that's almost as catchy as monkey news. Oh, God. Oh, I've got some monkey news for you. Let's play a record and come back. And I've got some great monkey news for you, Carl. That's from the REM album that people tend to forget about now because it was so kind of poppy and such a massive hit out of time. But there are some good tunes on it and there's one of them, Near. Wild Heaven, excellent on XFM 104.9. Carl watching a program yesterday and it was about these Japanese snow monkeys and it was all about how animals learn things that aren't instinctive, particularly sort of primates, because they see other people doing it and they start a culture and they can pinpoint when these monkeys. When one monkey first went down and got in the hot water springs and stayed there because it was hot and the others copied them and now it's a. It's part of almost a culture, you know, that won't be handed on because like stingy, but has to be learned each time and you know, and they. They groom as normal like other monkeys, right? But they're really intelligent and obviously the reason they groom other people, other monkeys is because they eat the mites. But also the monkeys have learned they like being groomed, okay? So they showed this one monkey. It went to a deer, okay? And it was grooming this deer to get his might off it, right? But then it didn't eat it. It held in its hand. It went over to a monkey, put the mite on itself to show the monkey adamite, and got a free grooming. That's extraordinary. That's extraordinary because it gave up the food knowing that if you put one there, this monkey would look for mites on it and it would get a free grooming. And it was like having a little massage. What do you think of that? It's not bad. I've got some better stuff coming up. Later on Monkey News. On the official. Yeah, did you see that? You see what? See what? Mine, though. Mine's true. I mean, that's an interesting and extraordinary. Actually happens. It's social behavior amongst primates. So I saw it. I saw it was, you know. Did it rob a bank, Rick, at any time? It didn't rob a bank and it didn't open a hairdresser's. It's not quite good enough, is it? My Monkey news, See the difference where I named the species, explained it slightly. Told you initially. Fat as opposed to. There's this monkey, right? And look at him. Look at you. Yeah. He's not interested with. Can I tell you now, can I try and describe for people the face that Carl has? I'll tell you what it's like. It's like if you draw some eyes, a nose and a mouth on a balloon and then inflate it to about half full, that's what Carl's face looks like. That's what his head looks like. It looks like a face you've drawn on a balloon. Very small. The rest of the head, huge. It's just that today I'm a bit tired. Right. That's one thing. Why are you a bit tired? I just haven't been sleeping. Right. Why not? I don't know. I've got a lot going on in my head. Oh, this would be like the Simpsons. If we could actually look in there. There would be two monkeys grooming you. Plus, you've been talking about, like, stuff that I can't relate to in that. So I'm writing poetry. Like what? Reading books, doing poetry and stuff. I never did any of that. What did you do? Well, at school, they didn't. They didn't bother. They tried to get us to write more. Right, right. By giving you a pen. They Used to give us these school diaries. Yeah. Little. Little Red Book. And it was a way that they kept an eye on what you were doing out of school hours. Right. So some kids would write down, you. Know, stole a bike, burn the house down. Yeah. But when I was at school, around that sort of 12 age, I didn't get up too much. You have no money, there's no you can do. So every night it was the same thing. I'd get home and I'd have to. I'd have to go to the shop, right, and get some potatoes and some bread. Every night, right? And I kept taking this into school. What was it? Dublin in the 17th century. What do you mean? Every day you went to the shops and got potatoes and bread. That's. That's kind of what I had to get all the time. Why? What did you have? Chip sandwiches. Right, so you went to the. Yeah, you went there. So I kept the stick. Yeah. Yeah. I kept putting that in the diary, you know, every night, saying, went to. You phase. That was the name of the shop. What is it called? You Faze. What is it you or you like H U g? H u g H. Yeah. Oh, that was his name. You phase. Right. Used to go there, get the potatoes and bread. Bread and that. I love to fight someone who's named a shop after themselves. I'm not going to say what we sell, it's named after me or nothing, or I'm not opening. Mainly potatoes and bread, white sliced loaves. King Edwards and the teacher used to always say, just write something different in there, make something up. Because, like, you know, Monday, Tuesday, all the way through to Friday, every night it was just went to. You Faze. Are you sure? Sure it wasn't an advert? Sure it wasn't paying you to say, get my name in the book? Yeah, the only. The only time that it changed and she said, oh, that's. That's made it a bit more interesting was when it was my birthday and I had to buy a cake, Potatoes and a cake. And she said, oh, that's good. Yeah. That was my 13th birthday. My mum said I got on from school. She said, oh, you're 13 today. Teenager. Big, big turnover. Go and get a cake. That's your experience of writing? No. What? No, that's your experience of your 30th birthday. Oh, by the way, you're 13 today. Go and get a cake. Yeah, brilliant. Big surprise. Was it a big surprise? Yeah. That is brilliant. I love it. That's the only sort of writing. Well, they never asked you to write essays or stories. Did you never write a story or a poem or a. The stories I did earlier on were, you know, you made them up, but it was that thing that I'd always end them with. And an alarm went off and it was all a dream. Every single one of them. Yeah. Yeah. But they didn't. They didn't. I mean, it was a bit of. A. I bought some potatoes and some bread. Then I went to jump some more. Potatoes and bread. But did you ever do anything, right, about an adventure when you were a spaceman or you were in, you know, you were a cowboy or. No, all the teachers, like, had scams going on. So, like, in English, right, you'd go in there and the teacher would say, right, what we're doing today is. Got a load of brochures from Thompson, but they say, like, 1983 on the front. So I've got a load of stickers here that say 1984. Let's see how many you can do in half an hour. You are joking. Did you go to school with Oliver Twist? Sorry? You are joking. I'm not. That's what they did. So the teacher must have been getting, like, a freebie or something for helping them out. You. Is this honest? Honestly, yeah. That's what I was. That is fantastic. They were all. Other than Mr. Fagan. You heard? Yeah. And then when they saw Karate Kid, they added their. Every kid washing their car. Go. Wax on, wax off. Hurry up, I'm teaching you summit. Wax on, wax off. Paint the fence. So I'm just saying, you know, that's. That's why I'm a bit quiet, because you're talking about stuff I can't. Can't relate to and why. And why didn't you sleep last night? I'm just. I haven't slept well for. Since I was about 12. Do you sleep well, Steve? Wait, wait, wait. You can't let go. I haven't slept well since I was 12. What do you mean? Do you know, like a proper. I used to love going to bed as, like, a kid. Yeah. Whereas now it's like, oh, am I gonna sleep tonight? And I sort of wake up about four times. Whereas when you're a kid, I remember really loving, like, going out of bed. There was one time where I actually laughed myself to sleep because I couldn't. Believe me, look, I've never had it. When you're really tired and you get in bed, the pillars feel cold and it's like, I can't believe this. Yeah. And it happened twice. Once when I just went to bed and I was really looking forward to it. And also when I helped my dad out once, like, through the night, he worked at, like, at this paper company, right? And I helped him out and I got in at about 4 in the morning with him, got in bed and I just was like. I was laughing my head off. I had to put the pillow over my head because I couldn't. Believe me, look, I was like, oh, this is great, this. And going to sleep. I. I just have to say, life up north is so extraordinary. No, but you must be the easiest kid in the world to please. No wonder she knew she could just go get a cake. It's sort of like, what. What was he expecting? He were expecting an extra hour in bed, but we got him cake as well. Go in without any supper. Brilliant. Brilliant. Yeah. Your own bed. How long was it before you got your. What did you used to do before? Just some straw in the corner? No, just that. That thing of when you're really tired and. And. Do you ever do this with Suzanne now? Do you ever laugh yourself to sleep with her? No, that's what I mean. She can't sleep because you're chuckling away. I'm just. I don't know what's up with me. I've got a lot going on. What do you mean you've got a lot going on? I don't know. I was talking to the security bloke before, saying, do you sleep? Have you got much going on in your head and stuff? And I don't know, he wasn't insulted by that, I'm sure. Going up to someone and going, have you got a lot going on in your head? That is brilliant. It worries me. It's interesting that your lack of sleep coincides with the diaries and the writing of the bread and potato story every day. I don't know if once you had that responsibility. Why don't you, every night, go to Hugh phase, get some bread and potatoes, you don't have to eat them, then go to bed and I think you'll be chuckling yourself to sleep in no time. Radiohead. There, there, they're there. They're their new single. Nice. On XFM 104.9. Now, listen, some DJs are a little bit lazy. They. They get playlisted or they get people to phone in with requests. I mean, they sort of work out what they're going to say. Now we. We choose our records, don't we? But we are very lazy. Yes. So I thought, why don't the people phone in, say, what do you want us to talk about? Clever. Yeah, clever. I mean, cuz I'm out of stuff and I didn't come in with any stuff anyway, but I mean I'm out of just. Yeah, what's the number, Carl? Sorry, are you out of breath having finished that sentence? No, I've been squeezing his head. All right, fine, as long as there's a decent reason. What I do my technique. I'm only allowed to squeeze his head between one and three, aren't I, Carl? Yeah, that's right. And what I do is I get ready, there's one, I do the clamp either side of the temple and I squeeze. And that's dangerous because I think the head isn't as strong that way. So I don't go too fast. But then when I put one on the forehead and one on the back of the head and I squeeze, I go really hard, don't I? So do call in with stuff to talk about on 0870. 0800-1234. See, I don't know what Dr. Fox is talking about. I can't believe any of the award winners have ever spoken about the various techniques to use while squeezing a person'. In. What should we talk about? I'm stunned at Carl's rudeness. Okay, that's Badly Drawn boy, by the way. All possibilities. There's a lovely chap just calls in saying about sounds and Carl, because the records ending, he doesn't say, oh, I've got to go to the records end. He went, yeah. And he. So still there. Well, just check if he's still there. He doesn't want to be on radio. He said he didn't want to be on the radio, but I think he should apologize. I'm still here. Hello. Hello. All right, I'm still. I did ask not to be put live on radio because I get very embarrassed. Don't worry, all we want to do is. Just wanted to apologize for Carl's curtness and his rudeness. Now all I want to say is the station is good because you couldn't have a worse slot on a Saturday afternoon, right? Because the youngsters are in the boozers, the older fellas are doing the punting, the racing, the football and whatever. The thing is, the state you play. If you want, if you want to. Get number one, this is XFM, not Radio 2. If you want to be, if you want to be the top, all you got to do is start playing Natalia on Bravery and have your audience with one puke of hair between four legs. Okay, thank you. That's why I don't want to go live on radio. But you are. When Christian got a little bit sick about being 13, then he got to go. Whatever. You're the soundest station in the area. You cover. I don't like all the stuff you play, the station plays, but you're actually doing what's there. Thank you very much. Keep going. You keep going. Persevere. And. And you'll. It's well worth listening to anyway. Okay. Otherwise I would. Can you hear us? Thank you. Bye. Be careful. Yeah, I mean, I can see why you cut him off. Stop it. We've had so many calls. Carl was getting annoyed. There were so many calls. And we've had suggestions from Ned saying, talk about Jimmy Savile. John in North London. I've just got John in North London. What does he want us to talk about? Oh, forgotten. Becca from Liverpool wants to talk about Tracy Emmon and Damien Hurst. Ah, Paul Andrews. Your mum called. Stop calling her telling us. Listen to XFM. Yes, you. Paul Andrews is about 38, at home with your wife and kids. Your mum just called in. I think someone wanted amazing monkey facts. I can't even do this right, can I? To be honest with you, last week we were slagging off Carl as being the weak link in this show. I think it's clear what the weak link is. Oh, God. Who's the bloke who wants Hayley to go with him to X Men? See, I shouldn't make notes. What's wrong with you? If you didn't spend so much time squeezing his head and eating pies, we might get something done. Right. Okay, then. What should we talk about then? Play a record and we'll discuss this. Trace Yemen. Make your bed, David. Heirs. Stop cutting up sharks and things. Picasso. All right. Right. Rockbusters. What have you got for us, Carl? Right, there we go, then. Three clues. Clues. Couple of initials. Email in. Ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk Win some stuff. Do you want to go through this stuff? You get them. You're definitely improving yourself as weeks go on. We've got a free CD set of the best of Inspiral Carpets. How they strangle it over three CDs, I have no idea. Yeah, I know. Extraordinary. A number of other CDs, all of which are okay. Plus a T shirt and a copy of Marion Jeff Series 1 on DVD. Not bad at all in an XFM band. Right, he's noticed X Men 2 isn't there because it's not out yet, but it is at the cinema. So I think Hayley should go with what's his name? Shut up. Okay, right, go on, Carl. Right, the clues are. Clue one. That. Oh, they're having problems. Ah, this is brilliant. Rockbusters. This is what we really know. I'll tell you what, I think Foxy was really soft on us. I think he. Oh, go on. This is what we tune in for. Okay, so this one again. So go on. This is brilliant. Come on. This is like who Wants To Be Millionaires? Come on, Carl. Don't worry about him. He doesn't understand radio. Kyle, I heard his show before he had us. He was doing it sounded just like Dr. Fox. Yeah, go on. Clue one. They're having problems. They haven't got any rice. Say it again and say it like it's written down. Right. Say it like it's like you're reading it as opposed to making up as you go along. I know you are, but say it again. Because all the ums and ahs, people who think are integral. They're having problems. Do it again. They're having problems. They haven't got any rice left. Different. Different encrypted clue everywhere. That's the matter. What's the initial? Cc. Cc and the clue again. They're having a few problems in that they still haven't got any rice left. Different every time. God, that's number one. Second one. The Geordie fella doesn't know what he's been charged for. Ah. Okay, what's the initials there? Bw. The Geordie fella doesn't know what he's being charged for. Right, and the final one, if he had two bricks and he had to throw him at two women. Right, stop. Right, you've gotta go through this without going right. Oh, yeah, just do it again. Just say. Think what you're going to say. Then say it. I had two bricks. Oh, no, it was. If I had before. Well, I've got. Stop him it. Stop. Cuz I'm going to burst. Right, Carl, work out what you're going to say and say. Okay, just calm down. Can we just calm down? Okay, I had two bricks to throw at two women and I didn't hit either of them. Right, okay. The initials mm. Right, so quickly again. They haven't got rice. I've got that and it's brilliant. That is a brilliant one. Okay, right. They've. They've run out of rice. They've got problems on their hands. Cc. Right, the second one. Geordie fella. Doesn't know what he's being charged for. Right. Bw. And they had two bricks to throw out. Two women didn't eat any of them. Right, that's. Mm. Gervais, XFM. Brilliant. Win some stuff. It's. Email me ricky.gervaisfm.com UK oh, Evan Dando and the Lemon Heads. That's a track called Rudy With A Flashlight. Of course Evan's got a new album out, but working for an alternative radio station, Rick, it would be ludicrous to think there was a copy of that lying around. Oh. Do you know what I mean? But email only. The Rockbusters. That's what this is all about. Rockbusters coming up soon. Monkey news indeed. Plus, of course, I have very special guests this afternoon. Tattoo. Oh, yeah. Look forward to them. Advertising. Yeah. Six of them. White Stripes. Seven Nation army on XFM 104.9. Carl, are you thinking of starting a family? Only if, like, an accident happens or something. Yeah. Were you there, Rick, when we were chatting about this the other day? Oh, yeah, no. What did you say, Carl? Well, we're talking about his career and because he's on mtv and I was going, oh, you got to do this now. He's going, look, if it happened, it happens, it happens. I said, I've said to Dan, if it happens, it happens. Because what your plans are saying with, are we gonna have kids? And I go, look, if it happens, it happens. I go, well, how would it happen? He goes, if a condom splits? Amazing. I love the idea that that's the way you plan for a child. Imagine telling them that when. Where was I conceived? Can't remember. The condom split. Yeah, you're an accident. I love that the romantic nature of. That was an accident. But, you know, it doesn't matter. Yeah, it doesn't matter. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah. Do many people sit down and say, right, do you think we should. Yes. Well, I stay. Lay down. Yeah, I'm busy. You can't play, you can't sit down. You have got time for that discussion? No, it doesn't mean the conception. I think it means bringing up a child till it's 18. But the thing is, as well, it's one of them in it. It's like if you think about having one, you go, well, the sort of negatives, you know, outweigh the positives, I think. Right, go on. But if you have one, you go, oh, it's not that bad, is it? So what are the positives and what are the negatives? Like? I say, the Negatives outweigh it. I can't think of that many positives. They get in the way, don't they? Cost you a lot. Costs a lot of money. Same with marriage. Like Suzanne saying, we'll get married. So what for? Well, marriage doesn't cost anything. Well, it does. Well, no, now you go to the registry office and then buy a house. But then what's the point? Well, tax breaks, you know, presents. I don't think you get them anymore. I looked into that. You're romantic. What would you rather have, a ring or a 3% saving? I love it. Well, yeah, I don't see the point. Anyway, I got that on one knee and presented with some Inland Revenue forms. Yeah. Just to show the benefits. That is great. I mean, if you are planning it, I think you gotta involve me and Steve in the radio station because it'll be. I mean, you take quite a lot on, don't you? So if you've got a kid at home and you're not. And you're not sleepy, you haven't slept since you're 12, you've got this, you've got MTV, you've got a kid, you know, it might be one step too far because I wouldn't want. I. I wouldn't. I wouldn't want to push you over the edge. Go on. Sorry. No, I just was gonna say. I was talking to Suzanne last night about it and saying, you know, about earning money and that, and she said, well, you're already sort of earn a little bit more than me, so, you know, if you get loads of money. She said, I'd be happy staying at home and doing nothing, maybe looking after a kid. I said, oh, so that's not happening, right. I said, I could have a load of money now, tucked away. I could have won some money. And I wouldn't tell you, I still want sort of that checker for every month because I get a check offer to sort of pay the bills. Yeah. And I think you need to keep that in a relationship. Sure. Do you know what I mean? Work as a team. Yeah, yeah. That's not working as a team. Gosh, it is. Well, no, you share everything. Sharing everything is working as a team. Whether you are taking some 35 grand back. It's not like you think that. Oh, no, I won the pools, but I give her half, she'll get lazy. She'll just sit around the house doing nowt. So she's still gotta go to work in a job she hates. Yeah. I'll tell you though, she thinks that it'd be the worst thing that could happen if we got a load of money. Because she'd want to go to Egypt. I'd say, I'm not going. Why would you want to go to Egypt? I don't. That's what I said. No, why would you. Why does she want to go to Egypt? She wins a lot of money. She said it's, it's meant to be pretty good. So, so the incredible wonders of the pyramids and the Sphinx and so on, that's not of any interest to you? I've seen it though, on the telly and that. I don't, I don't, I don't want to go all that way just to see it. Exactly, right, exactly. That's experience. Other cultures, other lifestyles. Travel broadens the mind. Wow. Not really seen enough. Different ones here in you. Yeah, there's, there's parts of within. Oh, you haven't seen yet. Yeah. Okay, well, so, so you're, you're, you don't want to make enough money. You don't want to make a lot of money because you're worried that Suzanne might want to go to Egypt and. Then that'll be no. And that's going to tell you, Tell. Her that I'm making a lot of money. I can still tuck it away. Right. And what will you do with it when you turn up in a big converted limo? Come on, we're going to bingo. Where'd you get the car from? Never the mind. Right. What? Won't you be suspicious when you've got a pet chimp? You know what I mean? What are you. I mean. Yeah. What would you spend it on? Is there nothing that you want for? No, I've never. No, there's now at the moment. Honestly, it's, it's. I'm quite happy. Do you know what I mean? I don't ask for much. But you're not happy. You're always whinging and moaning, always winging, always whinging. Clearly there's something wrong. Well, if someone gave you what. Okay, right, let's, let's be serious. We're not talking about billions, right? But if someone gave you a cash injection, just a one off cash payment of £250,000. Okay, what would you do with it? I mean, that's too easy. Because that should obviously be a house. That should be the best house you can find in London. Probably what I've gone to. A tornado. Right, that's on your list. Okay, so it's so, you know, in many ways he's so sweet, but you. I want to shake him. Can I just point out to you Carl, I don't know if you know this but if you get caught in a tornado you do not whisk off. Into the magical land of Oz and land somewhere nice. Yeah. And crush a whisk still in your rocking chair. Yeah, it doesn't happen, it's quite dangerous but you go into a tornado number one. Fair enough. Number two. What, what brochure is that in? That one? It's Texas, isn't it? Okay. Oh, number two. So he's got tornado number one number two, isn't it? It's Kansas I think, mainly. Well can I just. I noticed someone's emailed here a link for. Can you believe you luck, Carl? Monkeys for sale. Now I don't endorse this in any way, but here you are, here's a monkey for sale here. Oh that's terrible. $2,500 it says male, Very smart little guy, loves to play and gives kisses, Wears diapers and clothes, has been around lots of people and loves them healthy and loves to eat. Sounds like Ricky. How much is that? Well it wasn't Carl. It says loves to be around people. Yeah, there's a given there. A given for pricey though. It's like that Donald McIntyre program, he did that Cheapest Chimps program. He didn't do Cheapest Chimps. He didn't do a program called Cheapest Chimps saying that. Well he didn't. There's at no point did Donald McIntyre do a program called Play Record a Minute. Play Record. Oh, cracking tune. If you're down in Texas chasing your tornadoes, this will be on your stereo. Surely, surely if you're in Alabama it'd be in. Well he doesn't even go to Alabama. It's Texas, that's where the tornadoes are. Do you not listen to what he says? Kansas. It's Kansas. Lydia Skynyrd. Of course. Sweet home Alabama, always worth a play. I think maybe once a month. Yeah, Carl, we're talking about having kids and stuff. I've always been quite thankful that Ricky's never wanted to have kids because I just think he would set the worst example for a child that he possibly could do. Just in conversation the other day just happened to mention that he's taken to eating in the barn. Well let me explain Summer, let me explain Summer. Right. I've got busy schedules. Yeah, I get up, I meet Steve at a certain time, then I go, oh, I've got to go at 3:30 today, Steve, I'm working out for. I work out four till five. I have to have summit to eat before I go out and offer me Johnny for a beer at 6 or some organ somewhere. So I thought, oh, God, if I go in and have a bath straight after, then I have something to eat. I go, oh, I got. Sometimes there's chicken legs and they're greasy. So one day I thought, hold on, I'll go to the bath with the chicken legs, I'll eat them in the bath. And it's brilliant. So I'm sitting in the bath, I eat the chicken egg. It's really greasy, right? I just throw it in the bin, go under the water, come up, I'm clean, I've eaten, I'm clean, I get dressed, I go, I meet Johnny. I've lined my stomach. And the good thing about that is that when I come home, I have three beers and I've eaten the chicken. I go, is there any bread left? I just wipe it around the bath. I got a lovely bread and dripping sandwich. That's not true, that bit. But I do, I do, I do eat in the bath. I mean, the second week of doing it, I was just eating in the bath. I think I was in chicken eggs again. I'm eating the bath. Jane walked past, just looked in at me and she went, christ, Caligula. What? Just to me, a fat Roman emperor. Eating Caligula, to be honest, is just too cool and impressive. Not Caligula, Old Man Steptoe. Have you seen the one where he's in the mouth eating the pickled onions? No. He sat in the bath. He literally sat in the bath eating some pickled on. Some of them slip under the water, he fishes them out, put them back in the jar. I'd never do that. No, you. Well, you'd eat them. They wouldn't let food come by like that. But it's. But it's the fat. It's chicken. It's big greasy slabs of chicken. You're throwing the bones on the floor. No, I'm for the wolves to scavenge, putting them in the way. Stop biting your nails, Carl. Not only can you hear it, it's really rude. I don't know what. Yeah, you're criticizing him. Yeah. Criticising him for biting his nails. Yeah. You don't know where they've been. You eat chicken in the bath and then go under the water and come up clean whilst sat inside water swimming with Greek and fat and chicken bones and breadcrumbs. Well, I like to bath. I like bath two or three times a Day. But do you not see why that's not cool and impressive? It's not like we're all gonna go, why haven't we all thought of that? To be honest, though, Steve, that is the only time I eat oranges. I know what you mean. Yeah, yeah. That is. That's. I've always thought that an orange. I go, oh, God, this is too annoying. And I don't bother. I don't bother eating oranges unless they're tangerines. You can peel them in one and put them in one. I do not. I don't have big Jaffas. There's just not. It's not worth it. What is wrong with you? Firstly, have you ever thought about cutting an orange into four quarters with a knife? Waste. What do you mean, a waste? More washing up. Yeah. Right, so this is what you got. This is why you can't sleep at night. Because you're thinking, I gotta run a bath and have an orange. I've got time. I'd like an orange now. I need the vitamin C. But I gotta run a bath for. At least have a shower. Gonna be in there with another man. The two of you are just. You are like children. You're infants. Your mentality is ludicrous. And you're embarrassing us in front of our special guests. Oh, yeah. I can't believe it. Now, of course, last week we've had. A number of letters. Rick, I'm just reading them now, saying, last week, loved your interview with Chris Martin from Coldplay. Genius. Another one here. Great insight into the man who wrote yellow and clocks. Yeah, fascinating. Steve Merchant's interview with Chris Martin was amazing. He showed his own TV show. Just some of the letters we've received. Yeah. So this week, we're very lucky to have with us Russian pop act Tattoo. Round of applause for them. Lovely to have them here. Tattoo. Now then, of course, much controversy that your kind of lesbian shtick is just something to try and whip up some press attention. We are proper lesbians. We love fanny more than cock. Okay. Brilliant. And, Tatu, lovely to have you here. Thanks for coming. Now then, you've got. You've got some live gigs. I understand. Plan. Yeah, duh. Okay. I can't help but notice that you sound, dare I say it, Tatu. You don't sound so much Russian as German. We cannot do the accent properly. Okay. And Tatu, it's a joy to have you. Thanks for coming. And finally, you're lesbians. Could. Would, for instance, either myself or Carl be able to convert you from a. Lesbian Ones we like the moth so much that the knob is no good for us. All right, well, thanks very much, Tattoo. Yeah, thanks, Tattoo. Thanks very much. Cheers. Extraordinary. Next week, share. Brilliant. So if you've got any guests, special guests you love us to interview, then let us know. Mickey.gervais.co.uk.com and we'll try and get there. Oh, dear. Play a record. Rockbusters answers next. I was going to say. Well, do you want to do that? No, let's do it next. After the. After the record. About gays and that. What? What were you gonna say? Oh, we'll look forward to that. Martina Topley, bird need one on XFM 104.9. Right, there goes the girls from Tattoos. See you later. Well, thanks, girls. Cheers. A couple of lists. What were you saying before we cut you off? Yeah, it's just that, you know, you had the girls in and that, and it reminded me I was talking to Steve in a week. Yeah. I think. I think it's when people were talking about going to string fellas and that. Yeah. I was talking about seeing naked people. Ah, no. Yes. I asked him, I said, when he used to watch Save, he accidentally flipped onto BBC2 and some ballet was on. Would his eye ever been drawn to maybe the gentleman's lower regions rather than the ladies? The gentleman's package? Yeah. Would your eyes ever be accidentally drawn to that? And you couldn't resist it. And you said. And you said, yes. Yeah, because. Right. Oh, dear. Well, go on. I mean, fair enough. All right. I'm always looking at the beautiful ladies, but fair enough. Yeah. Now, go on. But. Right, I've never looked at Wayne Sleep's testicles. I went. I went out. Have you ever looked at Wayne Sleep's penis and testicles? I went out on a night out, right. And it was some. It got to some point in the night where two women and two fellas got on the stage. Right, right. Started stripping off. Yes. Just. What members of the audience. No, no, I think they were like part of the act. Right, right. And what was its panto? The down the. You know, the fellas were. I'd like their undies on and the. And the girls just had the knickers on. Yeah. Right. Sounds pretty erotic at the moment. Gone. And at the same time, they all whip the pants off. Yes. Right. It was Spark's Fizz, wasn't it? The adult show. Now, I said to Steve at that point, sorry, I wasn't there. He said it to me later. Yeah, yeah. I said, yeah, well, you have A. You have a quick glance at the fellas and then the annoying thing was, you sort of. I thought, right, now I'll have a look at the women. And it was too late. They put the knickers on. How long were you looking at the feathers? Not that long. But why are you looking at them first? It's human nature, innit? Why? I don't know, but I'm sure you would have done the same thing. You just. You just sort of think, well, how are they shaping up? It's a comparative test. So what was the. What was the. Who had the biggest knob? Which one of the blokes had the biggest knob? No, it's like, you know, normal, but. This is a whole new side of you. This is a whole other area. So you look at ballet dancers, you look at the gentleman's. No, I don't. I just was. When he said this, it reminded me of this night when I was walking home thinking, didn't get a look because I was messing. Where was this. What. What event was this where people are stripping off? Cow. I tell you what, you are the most interesting man I have ever met. But are you comfortable being nude or not? We've done this. Well, I don't know what this is. We did this last week about, are you comfortable being nude? I know you're probably most comfortable being nude. It's just probably not in public. Well, Ricky's only really comfortable nude when he's eating. Yeah. Yeah. There's nothing to get, you know. Yeah. You can just wipe yourself down. Yeah. And just sit in the bath. Yeah. No, but I've talked about that. And then when I went. When I went home, I was talking to Suzanne about it and she said, what's all that about? You know, you don't like being nude. And I saw. It's not. It's like I'm part of an Alan Bennett play. It's just. I love the way you talk. Remember once. Right. I don't know if I should talk about this really, but. Well, that means you should, so go on, go on. Oh, yeah, right. We went to. Went to Tenerife, right, one year, and I was still living in Manchester. I'm scared now. I'm thinking about Suzanne, but she's. She's. Well, I don't want to know anything about Suzanne. Come on, it involves me more. I'm just explaining to you that I don't like being nude. Yeah. So you're in Tenerife. In Tenerife. Right. Didn't have much money, stayed in this apartment. That wasn't. Wasn't that nice. Right. I had the cockroaches in it and stuff. Right. Didn't have much money to go out at night. So we're in this sort of death trap of a. Of an apartment. Right. Anyway, so when I was younger, right, I had a bit more energy, so. So, you know, start having it away a bit. It's a joy. Beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to need to work, Right. So, you know, doing what I do, Right. Yeah. Someone starts banging on the door. So Susan. Everyone's at it. So you mean knocking on the door. Right, okay. Knocking on the door. Right. So Suzanne said, you better get it. So I said, I can't get it now. Can I have to wait a bit. I can't. I can't go to the door. Go on. So the banging's getting louder. Yeah. Someone at the door. Yeah. And she's like, hurry up, it must be important. In a minute. Just. So anyway, I don't want to know anyone. No, come on, finish the story. Open the door. It's a fireman. So I just stick my head round and he's going, you'll have to get out, the building's on fire. Right. So I'm like, in a minute. Sorry, you weren't still having sex at this point? No, no. But, you know, still sort of gotta wait a minute or I can't get my pants on. Oh, Carl, I wish. I'm so sorry. Go on. Now the place is burning down, so. It could be a serious big fire going on. Yeah. I'm sort of waiting. You can hear people sort of screaming and that panicking. Is that because the door's open and you're nude? Fire. The fireman's saying, will you get out? Will you get out? I'm saying, in a minute. Right. And Suzanne was saying, you know, think of something that's not sexy. Sure. So I was thinking of people, you know, thinking maybe dying in a fire might sort of calm you down. Yeah. Then the fire said, we need a big pole. Yeah, sure, go on. But what I'm saying is that to me, I wouldn't have wanted to go out and be safe over. Do you know what I mean? Over being naked. I don't like walking about. We're now on. So what I'm saying is I love. The idea of everyone huddled in there with all the firemen. It just. The cameras, fans, long and it's Carl. Yeah. A local news report. Naked with still. But would you have gone out? We're now on. But why do I have to go out with. Now on, I just grab a pair of jeans. All right, but you just. You know what? There's a fire. Coal. Yeah. Not everyone looks at men's packets. That's only you, remember. Most of the other firemen wouldn't be going, oh, look at him. But what I'm interested is, pleased to see us, Carl, how long did it take? And did the thought of dying in a fire help? After a bit. But the fireman sort of had a go at me. Sure. What do you mean? Well, he wasn't happy that I was dawdling. Well, to be fair. But what can you do? Answers on a postcard to the usual address. Xfm, care of. Let's just get these right. Let's play a record. Let's have Rockbusters and Monkey News. We don't have time for Monkey News. We'll squeeze them in. Life On Mars By Day. David Bowie on xfm. Right, come on, we're running out of time. Blockbusters results in. Sorry. Oh, what a giveaway. Oh, no, embarrassing. I've given it away straight into Monkey News. So, yeah, Robusters. What are the clues? The clues were. The first one was, they're running out of rice, so they've got problems. That was cc. That was China Crisis. Right, okay. Yeah. If they ran out of rice in China, it would be a crisis. Fair enough. Second one, the. The Geordie fella doesn't know what he's being charged for. Right. That was Bill Wyman. Brilliant. Yeah, brilliant. And the third one, I had two bricks to throw at two women and I didn't hit either of them. That was Mr. Mr. Mr. Mister. I let him up. Those were all right, though. That's extraordinary. The winner. Gina, I think. Gina Fairy. Well done, Gina. And the reason I gave it to Gina is because she's included. And this is a wonderful segue. Some monkey fact information of her own. She says, apparently, that the group Chumbawumba got their name from one of those monkeys in a room with the typewriter experiments. Someone did it as a joke. And Chumbawumba was a word that was typed out. And that's the group. That's where the group got their name and their lyrics. Absolutely, yeah. Which is good. So let's have official Monkey News play the jingle. Oh, Tim, Patsy, that Monkey news. All right, we've got to be quick. Go on. This is something that was sent in to me ages ago and I don't know why I haven't done it yet, because it's brilliant. We were talking about Monkeys typing, the Shakespeare theory and all that. Well, this is about little monkey called Marty, right? Basically it's in some science lab, right? It's in there. It was wandering about out of its cage, right? The lab fella was busy on the phone or something, right? And typical, it's wandering about. It goes up to a PC that's in the corner. A little computer types down, my name is Marty, right? So the fella got off the phone, saw this on the screen with the monkey sat there, says to his mate, have you done this? Right, hold on, Carl, let him finish before you question. Always let him finish. I don't know what to do. Times against us. Come on. He said, he said, have you done this? He says, don't walk. He said this on, on the screen here, saying, my name's Marty, right? He goes, what are you talking about? As he's having an argument with his mate, saying, you're lying, you did it. Monkey sat there typing, this isn't a practical joke. My name is Marty, right? And that's the end of the story. I'm not coming in next week. I think you still think we need a week off. I actually think we need a week off. It's doing a. A web chat or something. You can go online and have a chat. Chat with it. The monkey's doing a web chat. I don't know. Has he got his own website yet? His favorite, Buffy the Vampire. Look at that, right? Do you believe that, Carl? So there. No, but do you believe it? Do you believe that monkey could type that and then say, this is not a practical joke when he's all arguing. Steve. Yeah, well, it's obviously a wind up. It's a joke. It's not even. You haven't even got some of the facts wrong. It's just a wind up. Have you noticed the date? So April 1. It is April the first. You are joking that it was sent. You're an idiot, Carl. It was sent on April 1st, Carl. So you're saying the monkey knows it's. April 1st, but you don't do a wind up. Yes. Yeah. I think the monkey has thought, I'll do it on April 1 so that people think that it's a wind up, but in actual fact I am a monkey that can type and read. It's a shame you never went into investigative journalism. You could have brought down, you know, the Wargate scandal. Poor Carl. Well, I was thinking of a song that sums us three up. Yeah. What are we? What are we? What do you think? I would you sum us up. Tricky. Well, young, gifted and black. True enough. Apart from. Apart from a couple of them. Yeah. We're not gifted. No. And we're not very young. No, I'm certainly not. Should we take a week off? Yeah. Should we maybe just knock it on the head altogether? We'll take the week off and see what happens. Okay. See you next. No, not. Let's not. See you next week. A couple of weeks. Yeah. Cheers then, Carl.",

Yeah, I get up, I meet Steve at a certain time, then I go, oh, I've got to go at 3:30 today, Steve, I'm working out for. I work out four till five. I have to have summit to eat before I go out and offer me Johnny for a beer at 6 or some organ somewhere. So I thought, oh, God, if I go in and have a bath straight after, then I have something to eat. I go, oh, I got. Sometimes there's chicken legs and they're greasy. So one day I thought, hold on, I'll go to the bath with the chicken legs, I'll eat them in the bath. And it's brilliant. So I'm sitting in the bath, I eat the chicken egg. It's really greasy, right? I just throw it in the bin, go under the water, come up, I'm clean, I've eaten, I'm clean, I get dressed, I go, I meet Johnny. I've lined my stomach. And the good thing about that is that when I come home, I have three beers and I've eaten the chicken. I go, is there any bread left? I just wipe it around the bath. I got a lovely bread and dripping sandwich. That's not true, that bit. But I do, I do, I do eat in the bath. I mean, the second week of doing it, I was just eating in the bath. I think I was in chicken eggs again. I'm eating the bath. Jane walked past, just looked in at me and she went, christ, Caligula.",
