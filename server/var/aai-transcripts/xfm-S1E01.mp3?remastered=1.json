So tell you why. I had two of the ingredients that I look for in a record. It was both fly and dope. High five. Yeah. Okay. You're sweet, man. Coming up. Yeah, I've got my film review. Looking forward to a great one. It's a great film. Got a song for the lovers any minute now. Sure. And probably loads more chat. Yeah, yeah, there will be. There will be. PJRV, this is Love. Xfm 104.9. It's Ricky Gervais show, isn't it? With Steve Merchant. Yeah. But you're gonna keep quiet now, Steve, because I've got to do my. My world famous film with you. Looking forward to it. Yeah, I know you criticize it because I usually do sort of like films that aren't on, you know, current release or that I sort of just do the plot or, you know, but, you. Know, have you taken that criticism on board? I have. Good. This week's Ricky Gervais film review is Jungle Book. The Jungle Book, yeah. That was made in what, 1968? I don't know. But listen. Shut up, right. It's a good review. Right, right. For people who either have heard it or haven't. You know, you might learn something. Sure. Cuz it's sort of my take on it. Has the review be begun yet or. No, no, it's good from now. Yeah. Okay, go, go. Right. The little kid, he's in the jungle, right? But he knows the bear and the panther. They're good friends. But it's dangerous because you got to watch out the tiger and the snake. Now the reason is they don't mind him, but he's human and he can make fire. They can't. That's why he's sort of in demand. Even though they've conquered the power of speech, they can't make fire, but. And then the orangutan gets him. Now it's in. Is in trouble. But the bear puts coconuts on and makes himself look like it. Then they fall off. They've got to get away. But then he meets like a girl and it's. And then they're not, you know. Okay. Do you write these yourself or you don't get a professional to do it, right? No. No. Okay. Okay. And what would you give that one out of five? It's nine. That's a nine out of five. Strong review there. A strong film then for you. One again. And you'd recommend that for friends and family? Yeah. Okay. Just on video or DVD or in the cinema. Okay, good. All right. And the film again was Jungle Book. Jungle Book, jolly good. All right. Thanks very much for that. Well, now it's time for a Song for the Lovers. This is the Smiths and Last Night I Dreamt with Somebody Love Me. Good. Okay, cool. Yeah, no, yeah, yeah, lovely. I forgot go the elephants. Oh, well, that's going to ruin it for everyone. They won't understand what you're talking about. Yeah. Smith's lovely song. Last Night I Dreamt Somebody Loved Me. Song for the lovers there on XFM 104.9. Can't believe I forgot the elephants. That is. That was key element of the review. Really. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't let it get you down, Rick. I know these things depress you. If you've not done the film review as best you could wind you up. Yeah, you stew about it. Played a beautiful song there. Song for the Lovers. And it, you know, I do get depressed when I see people around me who've got, you know, girlfriends and I think, you know, because I haven't. And I just think like, what, what, what's the rule? You know, we mentioned last week that fat bloke from. And Pop Idols. He's got a bird which annoys me, angers me and this really depressed me. Walking into Piccadilly Circus tube a couple of nights ago, homeless guy wrapped up, unwashed and northern. And he's been spoken to by some kind of carer, you know, some worker who's come out to dish out kind of stale sandwiches. And I just overheard as I was passing him going, well, of course it's very difficult maintaining a long distance relationship. And I sort of kind of lingered for about. I was thinking what. And he was going, yeah. And I could basically I pieced together that he's got a girlfriend. He's from Leeds. He's got a girlfriend who's also homeless, who's homeless up in Leeds. And occasionally she kind of homeless is her way, all the way. I love the fact that he's traveled to be homeless. I know, pathetic. It angered me that there's. Is there a lot of cheap housing in Leeds that ruined it for him. But it just was, I assume maybe she was squatting or something. But it was like. And it just depressed me because it was like, not only is he sort of is he homeless, but he's got a homeless girlfriend. But the homeless People are finding love. Yeah, I mean, he's so. I mean, that's really depressing, Carl, isn't it? Unless they both became smackers together. No, Carl's found love on the street before, haven't you? How's it going with your bird, Carl? Are you married? No. No, no. How long have you been out with her? Seven years. Because, I mean, you're quite a simple man. Yeah, you're sort of a simple in a nice way. I mean, you're like Helen from Big Brother. You're sort of nice enough, but. But I look normal. Well, yeah, you sort of do, but you could be one of those that just suddenly go mental with a pen. Yeah. People through the eyes. Yeah. Yeah, you sort of look normal, but if. I wouldn't really want to wind you up to a point of frenzy. Do you. How did you meet your girlfriend? Through work. What? Through her work? You found out and said worked at the same place. Oh, you're right. Right, right, right. You're quite an enigma, aren't you? Could you give us more on that? At work? You met her at work. What? She came in selling sandwiches. She was going through the bins outside. What do you mean you met at work? Why are you having an attack on me? You're the one who's sat and lonely. Oh, he's done you again. Yeah, but what I thought was interesting was I just scratched at him and he just went mental. Yeah, it's like a bear caught in a trap. It's. It's funny in it. You'll never learn. I was just interested to find out what the story was because it might be a really romantic story. Well, it's not. All right. Geez. I was thinking about you in the week and, like, does it worry you? I mean, you sort of joke about it now and we're talking about it in the office, you know, like, oh, is Steve really touched about the way he looks? And what's this? Where's that come from? He's done it again. He's done you again. I was walking on the other night and I was thinking about it, and do you worry that when you're old you will be on your own? You did start it, though, didn't you? Well, Carl, I'm glad you brought this up. No, no, because, I mean, for me, you know, a lightweight, frothy entertainment show on XFM on a Saturday afternoon is exactly the place where I want to discuss the desperate, lone only future that's inevitably coming my way. Oh, God. I'll tell you what. We'll cheer you up and forget all that. A bit of Embrace. Oh, one of the most hated bands. Hyde's main offender before that. Embrace. Make it last. I know you don't like Embrace much, but that's a nice tune. Yeah. They do cut a nice little chorus and I think their heart's in the right place. Okay. Yeah, Very nice. What. What could you do better? I was mucking around. That's always fair. No, I was thinking there's not enough avant garde stuff. I just did this, right. There's a little spring on the mike. What does that sound like? Does that sound good? I haven't got my headphones on. Does that sound good? It sounds brilliant. I was thinking of doing that and just send it to John Peel. It's good. Maybe some samples of, like, Politicians going, we will not. I feel it's more a B side at the moment, but, I mean, it's strong. I think it's. Yeah, you could work that up, but. That'S without strings or anything. Without. Sure, that's without. You know, that's just kind of a basic demo. When you've worked that up with a decent producer. Yeah. Man alive still coming. We got radio ahead. What are these fellas? There's a couple of. Quite noisy. It's just distracting. Yeah, there's a couple of fellas behind us taking pictures. Don't take. Why? It takes two of them. I think one of them just got, you know, a couple of hours out the office. They're from the. What are you from? X Mag? X Ray. X Ray. X Ray. What's X Ray? It's the XFM magazine, Steve. The xfm. What magazine? Where's that? Is this available in shops? Is it. Is it just a giveaway thing to. Kind of give away a bit of information on bands? Right. Gigs are coming. How is it available? Yeah. Who gets it? It's. It's in top magazines. You're really selling it, Carl. You're obviously a fan of the magazine. It's all right. Yeah. I don't want to make it. This seems. Now, like you've said, let's pretend we don't know what it is. You sell it on air, make it sound. I don't know what it is. Well, I'll show you later. Okay, cool. And if people want a copy of it, they can go to the website and subscribe and you get it for free. That's all right. Cool. And we're gonna be in it. Center pages. I. I didn't. I don't look my best as. I. I don't dress for radio. And, you know, it's okay because I'm photogenic. So I'll make up for whatever you. I'll push you forward. Rick, I don't know if you were aware of this, but we have some tickets to give away. Is your favorite band Marquis Smith's the Fall? It is, yeah. I thought it was. And this is your favorite venue, the Kentish Town Forum. Oh, I'd see anything there. I'd see the Fall anywhere, and I'd see anything there. And if you're telling me the Fall are there, we're not giving away, Steve. I'd like those for myself. Rick, I'm just trying to remember if your favorite support act of late is Schindler. Oh, no, I hate him. I'm not going give him away. Okay, so the doors are at 7:30. Doesn't say when it is. I'm only joking. Schindler. I'm only joking. By the way to Schindler. The lads in Schindler, if they think I'm being a little bit nasty, it's tonight. It's 7:30. The tickets are £11.50 in advance. I'm assuming there's probably some still left, but we have some to give away. How many we got to give away? Just as three pairs. Three pairs, is it? Have you. Talking of Schindler, you know, the. The people that make lifts or I think escalators as well. Yeah. If you notice, like in the bottom of lift, they always say Schindler. It's always made by some organization. Do you think it's the same Schindler, like from Schindler's List? So it's Schindler's Lifts. Schindler's Lift. And it was passed down wrong. No, I didn't make a list. Yeah, I made lifts. Yeah. Spielberg was going, I've made a whole film about it. It was three hours. It was in black and white, for God's sake. Was it. What? Where'd you get the lifts? There was no lifts in it. I thought it was a list you made. No lifts. Oh. Anyway, next. Check that out. That is true. Anyway, we've got. Yeah, we've got three tickets for the Four. Sorry, three pairs of tickets for the four who are performing tonight at Kentish Town Forum. If you'd like to win them, here's a question for you. Which Radio One rival station, which Radio one personality used to be a member of the Four? If you know, then you can get in Touch on 087-008-0012. 3, 4. Or it's ricky.gervais fm.co.uk Is it Chris Miles? I don't want to give it away. I don't want to give it away. Okay. I want to give it away. Okay, but two words for you, Emma B. This is xfm. It is indeed. Me just looking at the. The Polaroids, the test the photographers do. And I'm not all happy. No. Do you know what I mean, though? It's like, I kid myself, I must walk around. It does take mirrors and photographs, like. Oh, no. Yeah, I forgot. I look like that. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? Sort of like you look at that. Look at me, Rick there, that's always with me. Oh, there was a bloke downstairs, thought I was Johnny Vegas. He was going, I love those adverts with a monkey. I didn't have the nerve to say I'm not him. At one point, he actually said, I like that one when he hits you. And I went, yeah. He went, you do any more adverts? And I went, yeah, I'm doing a couple more. I just thought, it's gone too far now. I can't say I'm not Johnny Vegas. So I'm not really listening because I want to say to you, can you get me more square on? Yeah, square on. I'm not so bad. It's from the side. Yeah, the side looks bad. All right. Come on, Carl. What do you make of that pretty face? Yeah, this isn't. This isn't great radio. No, it's not. I know we never do. Do great radio, but this is really is. This is some of the worst we've done. Yeah. We were talking before about Schindler's lifts. Yes. Those people just write one thing and they're famous for that now. Do you think the Monopoly commissions should investigate Armitage Shanks? Yes. Because I've never seen another sink or. Toilet made by anyone else. No. When did they take over this? Can you hear that clicking? Yeah. Could you just stop just for a second while we're just. Just doing this? Because he can't talk because he's trying to make himself look so handsome. Well, exactly. Does that look normal? I've just changed my mind. I want to. You know. You remember that George Michael video where he doesn't appear, he just gets supermodels to play him or kind of replace him. Can we do that? Maybe instead just get a leggy blonde in. In. In our place, like five people. Exactly. Instead of. This is Steve. Exactly. He looks like five women. Yeah. That is Steve. And so you're talking about Shanks. Yeah, Shanks. Armatures. They've got it sewn up. They've sewn it. They have, haven't they? Yeah. When do they sort of, like, get. I don't know who the Shanks people are. I don't think they make anything else, though. I've never seen them making anything else other than lavatories and sinks. They seem to have got that. So who went? We are going to make. We're going to make so many urinals. There's going to be too many urinals. No one's going to have a look in when everyone. When anyone's out having a slash. They're just going to be thinking, yeah, Army Shanks. Presumably there's someone called Armitage Shanks who's got his name all over that, you know, whenever you meet him, you're just thinking, I've had a waz on Armitage. Shanks is wise a word. We can say wow, can't we? Yeah. Or piss or slash. Yeah. Either of them's fine. Oh, you two. Walk on. See, I like you two again now. I liked him sort of, you know, in the very early days. And I hate them for about 15 years. And then the last album, this and Beautiful Day, I think, really good. They've lost all their pomposity, don't you think? I saw one of them saying that he felt this was the best album they've ever made. I. I tell you what, I'm not gonna argue with him. Whoever it was, Steve could well have been the Edge. Not sure. It could have been Larry Mullen, real name David Evans. Really? Yeah. Interesting. Rick, you may recall that some time ago, we gave people the opportunity to win some tickets for the Fall, Performing live at the Kentish Town Forum this evening, supported by Schindler. Schindler. I know you're a big fan of them and we have some winners. I could have made more lifts. The question I set was, which Radio 1 personality used to be a member of the Fall? We did have some wrong answers. Wrong answers included Gary Davis, I imagine. Him in the Fall. Oh, that is brilliant. Noel Edmunds. And of course, Ed Stupot Stewart. Noel Edmonds. What's happened to lovely Nolly? Noel's just utterly doomed. Is he? No one will employ him now, it seems. Well, we don't know that. That's probably libelous. How is that libelous? Well, he might. He might be turning down stuff and therefore might be sort of waiting for a big back with Noel's. House party 2002. It is labeless. Thanks for pointing that out, Rick. It's already lawyers thinking that's not libelous. No, actually, good point. Yeah. So the winners are Minna, who's from Finland, apparently, according to these notes here. Mina. Why is that funny? Well, how would she have called in from Finland? Well, no, when someone says, where are you from? She might have been here for like a year. I got, well, Finland. Well, I embarrassed myself. Sorry about that, Rick. Thanks for tearing me apart. That was fascinating radio. Vinny's also one. He's from Surrey. Imagine coming from Surrey. And Tom Prince from Camden. What a great name, Tom Prince. They're all the lucky winners. I think we've lost it. No, I was really good the first few weeks, thought. Yeah. And even the first hour. But this last 20 minutes, I feel that I've bored myself. Yeah. What's happened? I think it's because you keep picking me up on every single thing I say. It can help, surely. And then if it's not you, is Carl having a go? Yeah, but he's more going for your looks. I'm more working on your personality. Right, sure. But together. So it's my fault now that the show's going? No, but it's like, you know, we're sort of like your mentors. You got to be harsh. It's like you're like Eliza Doolittle. And we've got. We've got lots of little stylists in. Like, I do with, like, you know, makeovers and that, all that faking it. They get in, like, me and Carl. Carl's working on your looks, I'm doing your personality. We're gonna get, like, stylists in and, you know, coaches. And then you have to do a date and the woman asked and there's three other blokes and she has to work out what the freak amongst them is. And you've got to go. No one voted for you as the freak. Yeah. Rick, I've known you for three years. I don't think you're counting for that job. Groove armada superstar on XFM 104.9. It's nearly end of the show, Steve. I'm going to try harder next week. Yeah. I mean, it started off well and then I. I didn't get bored. I just didn't. I couldn't concentrate. I know what you mean. I know what you mean. I mean, I thought I tried hard early on with the anecdotes that embarrassed me and which Carl just used as well. I had the Funny. The funny T shirt I had. Sure. And the, you know, I had the. Woman, you know, walk around in my clumpy. I had the washing with me. Oh, they were classic anecdotes, Rick. Oh, I love the first hour. I love the first hour. There should definitely be a sort of show on Saturday evenings. Yeah. On XFM with Kate Thornton, Blackwood. That would be good. Miles in. Go. Just remember the first hour. They used to. Oh, it'd be great, wouldn't it? That'd be lovely. Oh, it'd be amazing. There's people taking our photographs, which I'm not happy with, to be honest. I'm gonna have someone. I know you've. I'm only joking. He stopped. I was only joking. I've offended someone, which I don't like to do. And then we. All the stuff about. I'm worried. Go on. I'm worried because I didn't know that the photos were going to be taken, that we won't seem quite as hip and down with the kids as we thought we would on account of wearing these tuxedos. I'm telling you now, that is ironic. We are down by law. This next track is Ice Cube. It Was a Good Day. It's my selection for the hip hop track. As you know, we. We. We want to spend the word of. A lot of people don't seem to realize that hip hop is music as well, and it's out there and it should be enjoyed by kids. And it's. At the moment, it's kind of quite an eclectic thing, you know, it's very underground. Yeah. We're trying to bring it into the mainstream. Yeah. And in this, you know, Cube says it was a good day. You know, simple things like he didn't use his ak. That's the sort of world he lives in. That's what he's trying to get across. And it talks to you about your life. Sure. Yeah. Well, there you go, Ice Cube. It was a good day. Great song. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you've got a great song coming up as well. I have indeed. It's the song for the ladies, Rick. We'll leave people with that. Have you seen the film Magnolia? I have. It's one of the most underrated movies. It didn't get a single Oscar nomination. It's absolutely fantastic. Breathtaking cinema made by the guy that made Boogie Nights. Absolutely fantastic. Tom Cruise is in it. Loads of people. And the soundtrack is entirely written by Amy. Man. Now, I don't know if she's normally the sort of person they play on xfm. But she's a singer, a songwriter of great skill, I think. Yeah. And this is a song that features in one of the most breathtaking moments in the film. It's amazing when they. Yeah, it all brings it together. It is. You know, we won't come across, obviously, but nevertheless. It's called Wise Up. We'll be playing that in a second. But otherwise, Rick, that's it, isn't it? That is it. What will you be doing tonight? What are we doing tonight, Rick? Probably gonna be staying in. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And doing what? Oh, watching some telly. Oh, yeah. That's not always. I know you. Did I see a couple of cans of weak lager in your carryover? I did sneak them in, yeah. You're not going to drink them both tonight, are you? What are you, my mother? Okay, what you want? Will you be sleeping alone again? If I play my cards right, will. You be having a little tug time to get yourself up to sleep? I'll probably have a couple. Couple of tugs. If there's something Saucy on Channel 5, I will. Xfm 104.9. Here's wise up, Amy, man. Enjoy it.",
