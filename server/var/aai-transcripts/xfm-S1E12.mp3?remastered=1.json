The mouth with the tongue, lips was all over the brain and talk. The brain and talk through the throat. Oh, dear. Oh, language is his tool. I think we should do some introductions because I think it seems to me every week we kind of. Everyone knows who you are because you're, you know, the face of the moment, but they forget who you know. Me and the K man are. Well, with me, Steve Merchant. Hi. And the K man, who's our producer and friend. And can I just say that I really look forward to this show. You know, I get, oh, great, we're doing a show. I'm going to play some tracks we like and have a laugh. But now it's like, I'm looking forward to meeting Carl, of course. Honestly, I come in and I see his face and I go, all right. And, you know, just great. Like, just a little friend. Do you know what I mean? You know, when a kid comes on to play with a friend, you go, oh, come on to play. And it's like little friends. It's like that with Carl. Yeah, yeah. And we don't see him in the week, you see, we deliberately stay away from him in the week so that, you know, he'll be fresh to us. It was. Go on, you start off friendly like you did today, and as soon as Steve turns up, you start getting nasty and saying things about my little bald head. No, I said, look, okay, right, listen, let me explain. Carl was making the tea and you know those bins that sort of like a round, sort of metal Mickey type bin that you can take off a thing? I went, oh, that would make a good little helmet. It would make it look like metal Mickey. Because it's the same shape as his head. Sure, right. And I put it on and so far, so good. Really no problem there. That's just two mates having a laugh, Right. You're putting a beard on another man's head, Right. So I put it on and the swing bit through gravity in the angle. Swung and hit him in the nose. Sure, right. He went, ow. And I went. I said something like, it's all right. Yeah, of course, because you were being amused. Yeah, I think it's all right, don't worry. And he went, no, I've just washed my hair. Yeah, that annoyed me. That did annoy you. Because. Just because there was lots of, like, Shit and coffee and. And horrible gunk in his hair or. No, in the inside of the bin. Sure. But what annoyed me is he's hardly got any hair. Let's be honest, he looks like Moby. Yeah. So I said. I took the bin off. Yeah. And I was having it. I thought you. You ruined my phone is what. You know what I mean. I said, what's your hair. I said, we could do that now in 30 seconds. And he looked at me like I was in the wrong. I know. That annoys me about it. I know that doesn't. Yeah. But otherwise he's like. He's like childlike. Yeah. He doesn't understand that he's hurting your emotions. But. But also what? We were playing football, so I can't play football. Right. And so we were playing. Was that just in the office or. Yeah, just in the office before he came. Right. And we were sort of kicking it back and forth and I started kicking it a bit hard and. But he was quite good. I said. I said, this is great. Right. And we finished anyway because we thought we'd break Zemat. And I went, I bet you were quite good at football, weren't you? And I actually thought. I thought he looked like quite a natural, you know, I thought he'd be good. He's from the north. And I thought that's all he'd have. And he went. I said, I suppose you're quite good at football. And he turned the quickest flash. I went, I've scored once, right? He said, and that's because I was being chased by a bee. And I went, save it. Yeah. He went, no. I said, please, please save it, because I want to tell Steve that. No, you can continue now. Please tell us the rest of the story. You've scored a goal once because you've been chased by a bee. Yeah. You've done it now. Really was on the. There must be more to that story. Came in. I was in the school team. I wasn't that good as a kid at football, to be honest. Mainly down to. I think it's because my dad. My dad wasn't into football. Right. I think that's the way it works. And if your dad's into it, then you could be a footballer when you're older. Sure. Yeah. Because you're into it. And so I was in the school team because I got on with the other lads. They let me in the team. And, yeah, I was stood there doing nothing because I didn't really know what to do. I never knew which way I was Meant to be shooting. Yeah. Got all that messed up. Yeah. I just stood there, all right, and with my hands behind me back and something landed on me on, like this part of me thumb. You got. You can't just point this radio. It's this bit here, right? Yeah, yeah. And I thought, oh, what's that? And I looked down and it was a bee on me. So I start running. Yeah. Try to get away from it. And bees. Actually, something interesting about bees. More chance of getting stung by a bee in windy weather than any other sort of weather. That's incredible. Anyway, so I'm running away and he. Said there was no more. Extraordinary. I've already learned many, many things. You're being chased by the bees. I'm running. It's on your thumb. Is it still on your thumb now? It's sort of gripping onto me. Like a stagger. Clever. Like a stagger I love. Or a bee. Yeah. I'm running and I. I'm running towards, like, the goal. Yeah. Oh, God. And the ball comes to me. Yes. Wallop. Get it in. Brilliant. What happened to the bee, though? Did it sting you? They died, don't they? I mean, ultimately it died, sure. But at that particular moment. Oh, it sting you. This is probably about 20 years ago, so I imagine. No, no, no. Once a bee stings you. So did it sting you? Yeah. But didn't it sting you? Yeah. Right. That was the question. When did it sting you? When I was playing football, Carl, do. You want me asking you? Say you're on the school football team. Was there just 11 boys at your school? Listen, listen, Carl, all I mean is, at what point in this story did the bee sting you Straight away or half time? Play a record. Depeche Mode. I Feel loved on XFM 104.9. It's about 17 minutes past 1 on Saturday. Would never interrupt me when it's going that well. Sorry, I don't know what I was thinking. That was about. That was my record. That was about four or five sentences. True, true syntax. There was. There was capital letters, full stops, grammar, everything. Get the time out, did you? What time was it? Quick. What time was it? I interrupted. I was so eager. 1Xfm 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais, with me Smirch, Smerch and the K Man. The K Man. We're all giving ourselves nicknames now. Yeah. I'll just clear something up. Just. This is only a very, very personal thing. A lot of people who listen to the show that I've spoken to, friends of Friends and stuff. They think that I'm the guy that plays Gareth in the Office because my voice is obviously very similar. It couldn't be further than the truth. I'm so. That's so not the case. If anyone's listening. They couldn't be further than the truth. I don't want to take credit for Mackenzie's performance. That's a guy called Mackenzie Crook. He's a brilliant actor. Everyone's ever seen his performance. It's not me. Admittedly, he has loosely based his accent for the character on my accent because obviously it's a comical accent. We all admit that. Yeah. We'll agree with that. But that's where the similarity ends. Yeah. Is a good looking fellow, ain't he? He's a good looking lad. I mean, that's not a. That's not me. I know. Because you're saying I'm a good looking guy as well. You're just saying we're two differently good looking guys. Yeah. Carl. People are all different looks. I mean, you could say Brad Pitt's good looking and you could say George Cloon's good looking and they're both great looking blokes. They don't look alike. Exactly. So for me to say Steve and MacKenzie aren't alike. MacKenzie's a good looking fella. Exactly. You know, if you look at the Ben guy, they weren't mutually exclusive. There would be a crossover of good lookingness. Yeah. I mean, that's Paul with Brad Pitt and George Clooney. Wow. Well, it's quite a big pool, Rick. And I'm in there. Certainly with them. Yeah. Not. Yeah. I mean, I'm in one of those Venn diagram circles. You are? Yeah. You're over this one. I noticed. That's a separate one floating off from all the others. Yeah. Lizards and parrots. All right. Okay. It's good to be included in something, though. It's good to be part of a gang car. That's very important. Yeah. Only that's cleared up Depeche Mode there. And I feel loved. Who'd have thought Depeche Mode would have been that huge? I think. I think I was seeing little lads from Basildon with little plinky plonkies. And I thought that'd be like visage or something. That'd be it. Now they're stadium rock fillers. They're huge. They conquered America. He went through some hard times. He came up the other end. Well done. But see, I think this very. What you just said there is a very good example of why they Are and what. And why certain other bands aren't. Because if you think about it, for me, you see, whenever I think of a band name, if I see a new band coming along, whatever, I always use a very simple test, which is, can you imagine that you're the announcer at a huge event? Maybe it's like broadcasting around the world, like Live Aid or something. Nelson Mandela or it's a Nelson Mandela freedom concert. Yeah. And you can imagine there. He's there. Nelson's there. Yeah, with the Spice Girls. Oh, they're all there, there. But you can imagine someone saying, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Depeche Mode. The who. Exactly. But you can't imagine someone saying, ladies, gentlemen, please welcome to the stage. Visage. Ladies and gentlemen, will you please welcome our headline act. Welcome Idlewild. Exactly. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Ned's Atomic Dustbin. It doesn't. Do you know what I mean? You just know some fans aren't gonna make it. Ladies and gent, please welcome to the stage Mega City 4. You know what I mean? It's just a simple test. We'd like you to do that. If you're thinking of. If you're thinking of starting a band or you've just named your band, you're just beginning, just phone in, tell us, or email and tell us what your name is, and we will use that. Simple test and we will do the test. Ladies and gentlemen, will you please welcome. To the stage the Franken Walters. Jimmy Eat World. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Cooper Temple Claws. I don't think it's going to happen for those lads. It's a good one. It's a simple test anyway, but reasons. Please welcome to the stage 100 reasons. 100 reasons I think would work quite well. Just going. Give the email address. Ricky Gervais fm.co.uk. Reasons if I could. Ladies and gentlemen, will you please welcome to the stage Pop will eat itself. Carl, have you got like a sound effect or something of like. CHEERING we're gonna test jeering. We'll seek it out with. Have you got something there? Have a look on there. I'll just. I'm just looking in the NME for the kind of forthcoming gigs of the smaller known bands and it might be a useful place to just begin. The ladies and gentlemen, peoples around the world, will you please welcome to the stage Chumba Awamba. Have you got a sound effect? We got one. Nice. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, will you please welcome to the stage the Parkinson's playing in Leicester this week. So I look forward to it. That's a good plug in it. Let me see who else. If anyone wants to pop down to Leicester to see the Parkinson's. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Cycle Fly. Okay, okay, There's a genuine one here. This is someone. Simon's emailed and he says, will you just test this name for us? Ladies and gentlemen, will you please welcome to the stage coach. Not utterly convinced. No, it's not too bad. It's not. I'm worried about the sound effect. We straight. We started sounding like Chris Miles or something. What? He's a top broadcaster. Everyone loves him losing weight as well. He is hilarious. Funny. Funny man. Just. There's one more coming here. I'll just check this one. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, will you please welcome. This is Chris Knottsford. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome. Meanwhile, back in communist Russia. Is that band? I assume so. I assume it's his band. Yeah. Yeah. Well, how does he listen to us in. Hold on now. This is only local radio. How does he listen to us in Oxford? Well, if only there was some kind of digital format that he could listen via the web net. What is the. What is it? What. How does he listen in Oxford? It can listen on Sky Digital, go on channel 864. Lovely. Eight, six, four. Yeah. On the web. Yeah. Okay. What would that web address be? Xfm.co.uk sure. Click on the audio. Yep. And you get. You get XFM 10 seconds behind. It actually happened. Perfect. Just. Just of interest, what's the point of saying that they. If they can't sort of get us in London to listen to that? Because they won't be. And then they're either. They're already. They're either in London so they won't go through this nonsense or they're in Leicester and they can't hear a saying. Sky. Did you put that through at all? Because you might work in London for a bit and then go back and. Spread the word and like leave. Go back and spread the word. Disciples. Move back to Leicester. Yeah. Tell your mates. Yeah. Soon XFM is the most listened to radio station in Britain. Yeah. What we need is people on Radio 2 to give it a plug every day. That'd be ideal. Yeah. All Radio one. Yeah. Yeah. Any of the big rivals, Virgin. Yeah, we've often plugged Virgin. It was a good station. 105.8. Virgin Radio London. Great station. Really good station. Part one or 6.2. Lovely. You're listening to Magic 105.4. Are you getting. You're getting quite a lot of voiceover work now, aren't you? I am. That's not. I've stopped all that, though. Have you? Yeah. All right. Okay. Yeah, that's all right. Well, you know. You know, I'm all right now. I've got a bit of money. Classic 60s bands. I've just sunny. Ladies and gentlemen, will you please welcome to the stage the Scaffold. Oh, the Scaffold. Do you remember the Scaffold? You picked the lead singer. Looks a bit like him. But you know whose brother that is in the Scaffold, don't you? Mike McGeer. Do you know whose brother that is? What? Do you remember the scuffle they did? We'll drink a drink, a drink a Lily the Pink. Yeah. Thank you very much for the entry. And do you know whose brother that is? Whose brother? The lead singer. No, the Mike McGeer in it. The most. One of the main men in it. He's one of the songwriters in Paul McCartney. Yeah. I didn't realize that. Yeah. That's Paul McCartney's brother. Think. Think of that when they're going for Christmas. So I think Lily Pink was. What about 1970? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was number one. Wasn't it? Christmas? Yeah, yeah. Big number one. Yeah. I might know if it was Christmas number one. Two Little Boys was 1969 last year. It definitely was number one. Yeah. But I don't know if it was. It was. It was. Because I remember I did it. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Wow. So they go home at Christmas and Mrs. McArtney goes, all right, boys? How are. How are you, Paul? How you doing? I'm just starting a new band called Wings. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. So this is Linda. All right. Don't forget to sit down. Mike, what are you doing? Just had a number one. Brilliant round of applause. How many numbers do you have, Paul? 19. Still. We know what we like, don't we? The human rift. All goes well if you want to. The Long and winding. Boring. We'll drink a drink. Linda, do you want to be in the Scaffold? We're probably gonna go on tour and stuff. I know you love it. Well, I quite like it. Yeah. You're not going to be in Wings if you're going to play with him. Well, I got, you know, make a tricky decision. I mean, that's a great song. Everyone's loving It's Christmas number one. What are you doing? Eating his bacon. Well, I love it. You don't eat bacon. Yeah, but I love the music. I mean, he's a great guy. What are you doing? Well, I just, you know, I love to drink and drink and drink. No, you don't. Yesterday all my troubles seem so. Thank you very much for the Gain 3 iron. Because imagine going, well, you've had 19 number ones. I mean, you know, it can be time. If you stay like this with a scaffold, I'm gonna rule the 70s. Yeah. Things that carry on going like they're going now. The scaffold. Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome to the stage, Beck. Oh, nice one. Dandy Warhol's. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the Dandy Warhol. There you are. It's not. It's never gonna. That sounds like levelers crossed with wonder stuff. Rubbish, isn't it, really? I mean, it's fine, it's chirpy, it's. A nice old song, but it's this, you know, it's not. It's that thing of. It's just not essential. You just really need it in your life. If it never. If it never occurred, you wouldn't mind. Yeah. You know what Carl just said? Go on. Were you listening? Not really. He looked out the window and he looked at me and he was looking at me and I looked over at him. I said, see, now's that. That's. That would be good to die now. What? He went, that weather. That would be good to die. And I said, of what? He went, old age. Yeah. What's going on up there? He's a philosopher, Rick. He's on a different plane to us. Say like that the other week I came in when it was really miserable and I said to you, God, can you imagine dying today? Yeah, because whereas today you feel it. Would be a much better day to. Die because it's bright, the curtains open, sun shining. It's like. I mean, you'd still be a bit angsty about the dying thing, wouldn't you? I mean, I don't suppose that would be alleviated. Sure. Okay. Well, hopefully we'll still be broadcasting, you know, when one of us reaches that happy moment and we can. We can check. Yeah. Quite a lot of emails, Rick, coming in about band names. I think a lot of people are going wrong for simple reason. They think it's funny to have an ironic band name. They think it's a bit comical. I just don't think there's any great bands that have had a comical name that have made it into stadium filling. What was that band? Where's Me Jumper? What were they called? I don't know what they were called. I Mean the obvious example of one that was never going to make it internationally. Splodginess abounds Splodgeness abounds no, I like them now. Splodgny Surbounds Splodgeness abounds. They were great. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Carter the Unstoppable, Sex Machine. Usm. These are some of the ones we've had emailed in. These are bands obviously that haven't made it so far and I don't think they will. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage the Lazy Birds. Nope. No. Please welcome to the stage the Paper Clips. That's not a real band name. That's what someone said in. No band name is weirder than the others. And also you grow into it. I mean, the Stones and the Beatles are iconic because they are iconic bands. What do you think you'll grow into? Ladies, gentlemen, please welcome Shuttle Rock. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Treehouse Casino. I don't think they're gonna. That's just made up, well, possible. They all are. My point is, people say there's no logic to band names, but if you think a band name like the Smiths, that's genius. It sums up everything that band is about. You know, the kind of. They're capturing that mediocre world of grim up northness. You know, Sonic Youth. Sonic Youth is genius. Nirvana, these are. These are incredible Nick band names. So there is some logic to it. I genuinely believe. It's not just arbitrary words. The Cure. The Cure. Madness. Sounds rubbish, but they're good, aren't they? Yeah, but again, they were never gonna be. They were never gonna be World Beers. But they were a comical band, essentially. Yeah, they were a knees up party band. Madness is fine for that, but that's. Some great songs as well. And it. But it then it then it sort of turned it all because then, I. Mean, Rick, I don't know how many. Members Home Today is a great song. This is from an email. I don't know how many members of the band there are in Chimney Factory. But which if there's five people who decided. Have they all agreed? Yeah, that's a great. That's the best name. Dell, right? He started the band and they rehearsed around his house. So Dale went, look, it's called Chimney Factory because my granny's doing it. They go, all right, Dale. But it's not. I've got some other. But no, it's called Chimney Factory. I own the van and the amps. As paperclips gone. There's A band in Leicester called Paperclips. We can't, you know, we just argue over that forever. And you're just. All I'm saying is think before you name your band, all right? Because it's never gonna happen if you've got a comical band. There was a feminist band called Clitoris, all sorts, which is quite good. But you laugh and then you just. Think, oh, yeah, you know, I'm never. Gonna have that on my T shirt. Imagine that. Glitter is all sorts. It's that time of the day now. Talking of that. Yep. Song for the Lovers. Sure. It's beautiful now, Steve. I mean, I will play great old tunes to. Look, how's coming. We got. We gotta give him a little bit of Dandy Warhols and Air and Athlete. I know that. And they're great. They're good, right. But I wanted to play a Cat Stevens song, but I thought I'd better not because I've, you know, play that a little bit. And we quite like resurrecting old reputations, don't we? People like Alton John, who had bad faces. Or David Bowie. People whose names now are largely laughed at in the serious rock stars people. Might not have considered. I thought Cassie was like, oh, no, Rod Stewart. I thought, was he Rod Stewart? Many people now are thinking of the leopard hot pants. Yeah. Thinking sexy and all those sort of awful stadium sort of disco things. But he wrote beautiful tracks for Maggie May. And I thought, hold on. Two Birds with one stone. What a. About a Rod Stewart song written by Cat Stevens. Wow. Is there such a thing? The first cut is the deepest. Let's hear it, Rick. On this album as well is the Killing of George Georgie, Part one and two, remember, about the gay bloke. Georgia Boy was gear. I guess his favorite song, Girl's favorite song. Yeah. And I was going, oh, yeah, I remember that. Yeah. I said. And I said, did not intend to take his life. He just pushed it. When he gets mugs and killed, do you know what he said? I was sitting outside singing. He went, well, I said, as I said, they go out too late. They go out too late. He meant gay people go out too late. He went, no, they do. What do you mean? So they're always out. They go out when people are coming home. He said, if he'd have been in bed by 10, he'd still be alive today. And he went, there's one that works here and he's shattered every Monday. Oh, if you're gay and you're listening, just be in bed earlier when sensible People go, yeah, you're right. We're not on the continent, Carly. If you're gay and you're not in bed by 10, go home. Yeah. I don't get it. First cut is the deepest Rod Stewart song for dinner. And don't be like XFM 104.95 to 2. Absolutely. Richard Vase with me. Steve Merchant. Merchant. Smirch, Smirch. The Smirch, the Smirch and the K man. Kp, Carl Pilkerton, the K man pressing the buttons. Yeah. See that in Heat this week. What was it about the campaign to stop Carl going back to Manchester? You know, because he's a miserable sort of northerner. He goes, london's crap and I want to go back up north. Yeah. And I. I only need 40 quid a week to live up there like King and all that sort of rubbish. Right. Well, Boyd from Heat and we met him at the. That award ceremony. Oh, yeah. And we're saying about. Oh, yeah. He really enjoys car. He's getting a lot of people like Carl, and I was going, oh, yeah. But he's thinking of leaving. He's going, oh, start a campaign. And he did. And he put it in there. So the campaign. So write in if you like Carl, if you think he's really annoying, then we stop talking to him. Yeah, but I mean, I like him. I love him. Yeah. Have you ever read the White man, the White Van man column in the Sun? Have you familiar with this? This is where every day in the sun, they interview a guy who drives a van, a white van. Just, you know, in order to get the kind of voice of the man on the street in the paper. And he has to write, answer or just give his opinions, really, on events that have made the news each week. Just thought we could maybe throw some of these at you, Carl. Go on. Because we know you to see what your views are. Yeah. So I'm just the first thing that comes to your mind, the sort of your initial reaction to each of these top all things. We don't need to know about them. It's just your philosophy on it. So. Just your views, you know? Yeah. I have a few days off this week, remember, so I don't know what's going on in the world. Yeah. I mean, you stayed in London, though, didn't you? You didn't bury yourself, did you? I normally see the news, but I didn't. So what your view. What was your view on Will Young beating Gareth Gates in the final of Pop Idol? Don't like him. You know what I was thinking about when I was watching it all the way through, how he looks like he's got a wire coat hanger in his gob. That sort of. Again, his radio, Carl. It's a great face, the funny face you're pulling. Yeah, you know, but you know, a. Radio and that's a problem for you, is it? And just the way he's from a really rich family. I opened up the paper on the. On the Monday or something and it had like how he went to a posh school and he's got loads of money already. Yeah, it's just a bit fucky. What was the second question? There have been huge rises in street crime, especially muggings and carjackings. What's your view there? More youth clubs are needed, aren't they, do you think? More youth clubs. I like that. No, I like that because it's so 1950s. Yeah. It's sort of like you want a bobby on the beat that'll clip you around the ear. So once they've come out of national service. No, I love that. And if you find someone smoking a wood bomb, you make them smoke 50. Yeah, exactly. Oh, this is great. That is great. Did you used to go to youth clubs? Yeah. And they. They kept you out of trouble. You used to get into a fight afterwards when you came out, but for. The sort of hour and a half. You were there, you had a bit of pool and some boxing and a bit of pop. Yeah. So more youth clubs. That's good. I love him. I love him. If you're at home, just make notes because this is brilliant stuff. Honestly. You won't need a more honest from the heart. Exactly. Than this. This is great. Go on. This is not pre planned. These are your direct responses. Now, I promise you, Carl did not know what we're gonna do. He never knows what we're gonna do. And he always answers honestly. That is the beauty of Carl. It's not an act. What is your view, Carl, on New York's former mayor becoming Sir Rudy Giuliani? Sir Rudy Giuliani. Is he happy with it? He appears to be pleased with it. Let it go ahead, apparently. Okay, go ahead. Oh, he's genius. Okay. Is he happy with it? He's like your nan. Yeah. Yeah. What did you make of Michael Greco's character Bepe being axed from EastEnders? Problem for you, the whole soap thing. What? Sits back in Coronation street, isn't she? What's her name? Who? Bette Lynns. She thought she'd go off and be a bigger star. Yeah. All went wrong and now she's coming back. Always happens. Beppy will be back. Yeah. No one really cares. Sure, sure. What was the van reply? That was the guy. The white van man says obviously they feel the character has run his course, but I think he's a pretty good actor and I can't understand why. I mean, obviously there's a white van man there who's also got an opinion on script development. The 12 week narrative, the arc really shows itself up. Two last ones I want your opinion on here. What do you make of a cat that's been cloned in a secret 2.5 million research project to find out what if they can clone cats? Yeah. Have they had to hurt it? Sorry? Have they had to hurt it to do that? Have they had to hurt it? Yeah. Or is it just scraping its tongue for some stuff? I think the cat's fine. The point is that they're cloning another creature which is potentially very dangerous. Have you seen that film where they bring Hitler back that cat? What if that cat turned out to be a world dictator? Exactly. What do you reckon of cloning generally, Carl? You're concerned about it when they're cloning. For organs, you know, they grow them for the, you know. Do you know what cloning means? Yeah, it's when you like make something else. That's the same, isn't it? Right, Yeah. I mean, it's not gonna do any harm. Okay. And finally, on the World Council. Yeah, yeah, finally. What do you make of some city workers who were caught bonking in the glass lifts of the Lloyds building? What do I make of it? Yeah. Is that a problem for you? Do you think that's unprofessional? Was it the lunch break or. I think it was lunch break. There's their own time, I think. Fair enough. It only takes 45 seconds to go from the box them to the top. Is that a problem? They moved quickly. They acted, you know, on instinct. Do you think fair enough. If that's their natural instincts and they're both consenting, you think? Fine. Yeah. Okay. Thanks very much, Carl. Thanks very much, Carl. We'll have more of Carl's world weary opinions next time on the show. Lisa, I want to play a track that I love. I can't wait for this track. It's. It's by a great band. Just gonna do it before Steve does this. Coming up, we're gonna give away a great game. I've. I'm sort of clearing out my flat with Tyler and then we've got, you know, A lot of junk there. And we're going to give away a great game coming up. You've seen it, Steve. You're excited. Looking forward to that. It's a board game. It's a board game that we're all going to sign. It's going to be signed by Jerv Smerch, kp, the K Man. So you could win that. The classic album Copper Blue by Sugar. Listening to it again recently reminded how good it was. This is the track Hoover Dam play. White Stripes Fell in Love with a Girl on XFM. 104.9 is 10 past 2. Right. Okay. That's the first hour out of the way. Next hour. Steve. I've got a game to give away, as I said. I'm sort of cleaning out my flat a little bit and we're gonna throw away stuff. And I went. I went through that away. Yeah, I can give that away on the show. Because XFM don't give us anything to give away. No. Does anyone care what happens weekends? No. There's people coming here going, oh, he hasn't turned up. Fiddling with stuff. Fire alarms going off, the library. But we were looking for a track we played a couple of weeks ago on the same album. And it's gone. Yeah, it's been pinched since we last played it. This is a. I can't believe it. They move. That's like a tip out there. And I have to. It is. It is. Absolutely. It's disgusting. How many of the DJs on this station have won multiple awards like Ricky Gervais? Yeah. How many of them are double award winning to have someone of my caliber? I hurt my ankle. Didn't I move in a chair? I had to move and move my own chair in here and I hit my ankle. That teach me not to wear socks. Yeah. The socks were just taking out the stick, I think. I think just walking around barefoot generally. You know, there's the needles, Rick. There's all sorts. I know all that. Well, Posh does it in her video. She walks around barefoot. Oh, you love it. My heart's got a mind of its own. Ricky absolutely loves the current Victoria Beckham. Yeah, the sentiment. My heart's got a mind of its own. So, like, it doesn't matter what I'm thinking in my head. My heart says something else. Of course, what we did for the last week was change the lyrics. Just walked around for ages. Does anyone else do that? Just going things like, my wife's got a car of her own. It just seems like seriously, hours of Amusement. Yeah, just changing it. My knobs got some balls of its own. We're doing that for a week. Meant to be working. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, you were gonna give away this game, Rick. Yeah, it's called Donutters and it's a game for four players or two to four players. Have you ever played it yourself? I watched. We sort of got it for a party and I watched some people. Can I try and sell it to punters who may. Yeah, go on. Play the part of a crazy donut loving elephant in this hilarious game of fun and fast action. You put on a little elephant thing and you have to pull up and get up the donuts. Brilliant. Can you be the first elephant to get all your donuts on your trunk? Be the first one. So the first one. So this isn't a sex game by the way. There's no euphemisms there. Some of this is a bit slightly damaged, the packaging. That's why I couldn't read that. You're joking. Yeah. But don't worry because you're not much for this, are you? We'll start at £5. Bear in mind it'll be signed by double award winning Ricky. No, of course it's free. And Carl went, you got a question? I went now he said, well, something about the Elephant Man. Something about the elephant. Yeah. And I went, yeah. You know John Merrick? You went yeah. He went, yeah, something about that. Awful, wasn't it? I went, you know where Michael Jackson actually bid for the skeleton of that? And he went, what would the skeleton be affected? I went without. It grows. That's what happens. It's nars. And he went, you don't see any of that about these days, do you? Any great. I just said save it. Although of course you have to put on these masks when you play Donutters. So in a strange way that looks kind of Merrick esque. Yeah. And the game week. I should just tell people, listening. Is. Is elephantastic? Yes, it is. It says that on the box. It is elephantastic. I mean you yourself. Can I say a question? Actually this is a possible question. Okay. Should we sign it first? We should sign it. But based on the Elephant man question, obviously we all know who directed the Elephant Man. Sure, yeah. Parker. No, David Lynch. Lynch, of course, yeah. But do you know who one of the, the people that got that film made was? He's a very famous comedian. It was his production company that got it up and running. He may be an executive producer. I think he was even the producer of it. And he's an American famous American comic. Actually, you wouldn't imagine this was the same guy who is also producing a very serious, sober film like the Elephant Man. All right, we want to know who was that man? Well, yeah, but I mean, that was sort of. That'll separate. Have you seen anything else that's elephantastic? Not even. Well, offhand. Was hella fantastic. He was well a fantastic. Have you got any more memorabilia that you want to give people? Because I have to say, I've got. The counter won't take it away. I've got loads of junk in my house. I've got an old fridge, freezer in the front garden. Anyone's welcome to come and pick that up anytime. I'll sign it for them. But what about children climbing in it? That's not one of those with the handles, is it? There's several children trapped in there. That's a sobering lesson. Thanksfully won't come and pick it up. It's a problem though, isn't it? Because you can't just smash it up. You're right. I don't know what you meant to do. Well, listen, Mike, when I was growing up, I remember the council used to charge five pounds or something to take away, like cookers and fridges, so my dad used to bury them down the bottom of my garden. I don't know, there's. There's a cooker, there's a fridge for. There's a freezer of some sort. There's a dog and a couple of cats. They were dead. I'm not saying. I mean, my father's quite a mean man, as you know that, but he. My dad used to do that with dead relatives. Yeah, because those funeral parts, very expensive. A funeral can be, you know, up to 40 quid. Exactly. You know what I mean? Whereas a shovel. Shovel. A shovel borrowed off the bloke next door. Yeah, yeah. And not give him back, to be honest. Exactly. Yeah. Well, he's gonna go soon. Was he gonna say, okay to win. Donutters signed by Mr. Ricky Gervais and two other blokes you've never heard of. Is that a fantastic. Yeah. And the question is, what was the famous name, the name of the famous comedian? Give up the number. Give up the number. That produced and had heavy production involvement in the film the Elephant Man. The email address is Ricky Gervais, fm.co.uk Carl, what's the phone number? Oh, 8700800 1234. Right, next up, we've had a lot of requests. Carl's popularity is growing they want to hear. His is Super Mega Mix, the Britney Spears thing. Big it up, Pick it up. Yeah, it's good. All right. It's Mark being Blade, the vocals of the unknown over Britney Spears. Hit me, baby, one more time. Let's hear it. It's highly legal. We're fantastic. Go on, then back announce it, Carl, it's yours. Go on. That's Mark Bean Blade there with a. Bootleg and what's it called? You called it some. Haven't you cleverly called it something? What did you call it? Nick this record one more time. Good. Very good. Carl Pilkins in there breaking all kinds of copyright rules. Now, coming up, we're gonna be talking a little bit of feng shui, the art of moving things around so it's better. The ancient Oriental art of rearranging your living room. Yeah. The ancient art of don't sit near a window because you won't get any money for it. And we've got. We've got a book. Well, we've been exploring feng shui for our amusement. Yeah. And we're gonna be reading some great things. This is just good. It's good, solid feng shui advice for us. I mean, what do you need to know? I mean, just keep those questions coming to life. If you've got any question for Carl, don't forget, that's an ongoing thing. Anything in the world, any question, personal problems, philosophies online. It can be out of it. Just ask Car if you want, you know, just ask Carl. Okay. All right, Carl, you're up for that, aren't you? Yeah. And you give your honest opinion, won't you always? Yeah. Yeah. Should we give away donuts? Oh, is this what it's been won? Who's won it, Carl? Scott Hammond. Scott, he'd be loving that. He's probably gonna have a party, especially to play donuts. We've had a number of right answers, but I'm afraid Scott's the winner. And the question, of course, was, which famous American comedian was heavily involved in the production of the film the Elephant Man? It was, of course, Mel Brooks surprising. And he's got a company called Brooks Films. Our first. First person that called in, I think it was a bit confused. He said, is it testicle? Testicles, yeah. Yeah. When? What? Testicles, yeah. What was that illness? Years ago. There was a couple of lads at our school. Oh, yeah. I had really big heads. Right. And webbed fingers. And webbed fingers. Sorry, were that. Hold on. Did you find them in a pond? Did they used to be Little tadpoles. No car. You're not confusing your past with an old episode of Doctor who, are you? What were they called, these two? I didn't mix with them. It was just like. Of course not. There was a. Nobody thought anything of it at school. Because you used to. Yeah, it was. It's the North. There goes the creature from the Black Lagoon again. Yeah. Yeah. He is brilliant at trigonometry. He's late for double maths. Yeah. But, yeah, I didn't think anything. What is it called? What is the disease called? Where two fellas. Are they not even related? Rubbish. Not related. Were you near a nuclear power station when you were growing up? Yeah. You weren't really. Yeah. This has got a bit heavy. That's it. Hey, talking of enormous heads. Yeah. You were at the. The Pop Idol final, weren't you, Rick? You went in there just because you. Obviously Rick's a huge fan of Pop Idol. He wanted to be there. He wanted to give his support quite seriously. There was no irony there. He genuinely is a fan of it and he was you. You sort of had photos taken with various people. You're a bit drunk and you wanted to have a moment of it. It's obviously a picture of you with fat man Rick Waller. Yeah. But the best one is a picture of Ricky and his girlfriend with Dr. Fox. Yeah. Whose head is twice the size of any other head. It's quite remarkable. I don't know. He's a lovely bloke and he was really nice to meet him and everything, but in the. And he's got. He looks like an immaculate tan. He's always happy and he's. You know, he's. It looks in the picture, it looks like someone you might see in a carnival all who's built a huge papier mache head. And we're like Frank Sidebottom, just sort of walking down the road. It's just incredible. Dr. Fox didn't used to go to your school, did he? Go home with a mate. They were great swimmers. They were brilliant swimmers. Oh, God. Have we got another song lined up? Yeah. What we going to play Better for our mon. Let's hear it. Farah munch. Got you. Xfm 104.9. Well, as we promised, some feng shui. What do you want to know? Ratio of witness. It's a little. One of those little books that you see at the sort of like the front desk of like Waterstones or Dylan's or one of them. And it's just. It's a little guy, this Should I say what it is? I don't know. I'm allowed. Lillian. Two's little book of Feng shui. Obviously you can't go into it in depth, but it's some little, you know. Just some little sort of nuggets, I suppose. Yeah. Ratio of windows. The ratio of windows to doors in your rooms should not exceed three to one. Too many windows. Cause all your luck to seep away. Obviously. Hello. It is also better not to have windows on the wall opposite the door. Is that the case in your place? Carcass? You may need to brick that up when you get back later. I always remember I used to work nights. Yeah, right. And it was when my brother just sort of got kicked out the army. Yeah. I mean, mum and dad went away on holiday, so he was staying with us. He's got to write a book, Miss Bloke. You've got to write a book, Carl. Go on. Came back. Yeah. There was women everywhere. His women in every bed in the house. I thought, where am I gonna sleep? Had he set up a brothel? So. No, he's just a bit of a. Bit of a one. That's impressive though. A girl in every single bed. I mean, he was mad. So I slept on the sofa downstairs and I didn't sleep that well. Yeah. But I slept on it before when it was facing a different way. Sure. And I had a good sleep. So for you, that's proved the worth of Feng shui. Yeah, I think there's something in it. Did you honestly think there's something in it though? Yeah. Okay. We'll just read a few of the others. Okay. Yeah. It's not. I think most people know this one. Display the three legged frog. For luck. Look for a three legged frog. You can buy one from any Chinese supermarket and place it in the vicinity of your front door facing inwards, as if it has just come into the house. Don't place the frog facing the door, please. Come on, people. What? Think before you place your frog. I mean this. This really is. I mean. But. But what's the last page? Because that will be the most important one. Do you reckon? The last one. The well fars. Make a well farce and keep it hidden in your cupboard. It can be made of gold, crystal or glass. If. Can I just. Listen. If you've got a vase made of gold, you're probably all right for money anyway. Yeah, sure, sure. But this is the wealth vase. How to make the wealth vase. Fill it with semi precious stones and with soil taken from rich man's garden. So Just find the soil of a rich man. Take some sort. This is like bury a piece of steak and the water will go. I. I have a tooth of frog. This is. It's the one where. With the gods. Can you find that one? Oh, where's that one? Yeah. What do you make of feng shui, Carl? Is it something you believe? Well, like I said, I didn't sleep well on the sofa, so for you, that's proof. Proof positive. Yeah. You've got to get it right on you. I'd like Carl to read this out. Okay. Yeah. Do you mind? Read it out. Just read it out loud. Which one? Yeah. The gods are here. Right, Right. Okay. Just read that. That's such a good point. The gods. Yeah. Of wealth into your home. Yeah. The Chinese have several gods of wealth. Yeah. Which they display in their homes to attract what? Prosperity. Prosperity. Oh, yeah. Yeah. My personal favorite is CCS Chi Yi. Yeah. Who sits on a tiger. He sits on a tiger. Yeah. Okay. Wait. It's pretty difficult to find this. This fella. Yep. If you could use Kang Kung or the Three Star Gods. Oh, no. Read him out. Read out the names of the star gods. F U K. Read it out. Just read out. It's a Chinese God. You're allowed to say Chinese gods on the radio. You are allowed to say what you're allowed to say. You say it then. Well, look, you're so immature. Read the three of them out. Really? Okay. If he is difficult to find, you should use Quan Kung or the Three Star Gods. Fuck Luck and Sao. All of whom bring wealth and prosperity. And what were the names of the gods again? Because I just. If I'm making a note at home. It'S the Chinese God. Yeah. It's. There's Quangkun, or you can use Luxao. You can't say what, but it's a God. F U K. Yeah, I assume. I don't know if we're pronouncing it wrong. I really apologize. Apologies if we're offending anyone who's of an Oriental persuasion. But that's Kwang Kung or Look. Sour Fuck. And any of those gods are available at a Chinese supermarket near you. Yeah, that's feng shui. It's an ancient art. You can't give me that look. No clinic. Walking with thee. So there. That's feng shui. That's feng shui. Sorting. We've given away donuts. We've talked a little bit about band names today with a more insight into Carl's psyche. Now, you. You. During that record, you Said, are we knock everything. You saw something about the beautiful Triangle, didn't you? Yeah. When I talked about Ghost, you sort of. Just because you don't believe in it. I think it's because you're scared of it, to be honest. And you can't admit to understanding it and believing in it. Sure thing. On last night, Steve. Yes. The Muda Triangle. Oh, yeah. Do you know much about that? Mainly the song. Yeah. What was his name? What's his name? Bermuda Triangle. Where people disappear. Triangle. No. Barry Manilow. Yeah. Are you familiar with the lyrics? Bermuda Triangle where people disappear. Bermuda Triangle. Don't go near. Yeah. Shouldn't really make a joke out of it. No, you're right. Go on. But what it is, right, there's programs saying what it. What it's about. I mean, what do you know about it? As I say, mainly from what Barry's told me. But certainly planes and various boats have gone missing within the Bermuda Triangle. Planes, Yep. But obviously that documentary didn't exploit. He learned a lot about that. I learned a lot about American history through We Didn't Start the Fire by Billy Joel. Again. Most of my knowledge of the sort of tsarist Russia comes from. By Bony M. Yeah. He was the lover of the Russian queen. They put some poison into his wife. Yeah. Yeah. They shot him till he was dead. Yeah. Which is, you know. Go on. Sort of. Bit of. A. Bit of an earthquake in the sea. Sure. Lets out methane gas. Okay. And apparently if. Methane gas. If you were swimming out in the sea. Yeah. And there was like an earthquake and some methane came out. You can't swim in it. You just sink. Okay. Even if you're a good swimmer. What happens if you do two lads from your school and they. Yeah, that's. That's a. That's like a boy. So you can see them a mile off. And their webbed hands would get them into shore. Because they did actually say, even if you're wearing a life jacket, if. If the water's full of methane. Right. You just sink. You just sink. So what it's saying is boats have gone across the sea, got a load of methane in the sea, and the boat just sinks. Right. What about the planes? Is it, then? Sort of planes with little sort of floaty things? Could be. That's. That. That'll be the sort. They've landed in the sea. Right. And methane's coming. Sorry, Carl, what did the documentary say? Not. Not. I imagine your hypothesis might be. Yeah. What did they sound like? They didn't do the planes. Something else they said about it though. Go on. Loch Ness, the monster. Yep, sure. Probably doesn't exist. Okay. What it is interesting. Hold on. Interesting. Oh, interesting. What they thought probably didn't exist. Curious viewpoint. Hold on. What proof have they got for that, Carl? How can they go around saying stupid things like that? It's methane and people have seen. What's the. What's the lake? It's in Loch Ness. Yeah. It being the Loch Ness monster. Yeah. That's where it lives. That's how it finds its way home. That's certainly the clue again, Carl. That's the clue. Yeah. And it's. If it's. I wonder. He goes, excuse me. What? Do you know where I'm being the Loch Ness monster. Where would I be going? Oh, he'd be going to the Loch Ness. If that's your home. It's a way over there, you big monster, you. So the bubbles from the methane bubble up out the water. People think, oh God, it's a monster dead. But it's not. It's just water sort of shooting up because of the bubbles. Well, that's two of the great mysteries of the universe solved by Carl P. On a Saturday afternoon. That is fantastic. So that makes me. That makes me think a lot of things. So you know when mediums are sort of like going, oh, I've got something coming through. Do you think there are exhaling a lot of methane gas and thus that's making them not think straight? Do you think everything's down to methane gas? Do you think that all the mysteries of the universe are down to methane gas? Carl, what did it say in the documentary you saw? About what? What was the budgie happy? We know that budgie was sad. Was it. Was it in a room? Because they used to take canaries down the mines, didn't they? They used to take canaries down. The smell the methane and then the budgie would be happy. I'm not going to teach anymore. Play record should introduce this, shouldn't I? Beatles Long and winding road Smooth. Are we getting paid for this? Our freaks Electric Richard X and the Sugar Babes on XFM 104.9. Well, nearly through. We've had a few laughs again. A few tears. Absolutely, as always. Oh, excuse me. Don't be alarmed. I look quite frightening. But I'm merely a nice monster. I seem to have lost my way home. Could you direct me in the right direction? Ah, nice to meet you. Yeah. Carpilton. Hi. Um, what's your name? Why do you need to know my name? Well, it might help me to find out where you come from. Oh, my name's the Loch Ness Monster. Okay, all right, give me a second. Um, what was your name again? Loch Ness Monster. See, this is what I mean. When you came in, you're all over me like a rash. Being nice to you, yeah, gets towards. The end, you get nasty. It's the phone. Answer it's. See who it is. Can you give us a second? Listeners, just amuse yourselves for a moment. Speaking to. Carl's just on the phone there speaking to someone. We'll just keep you abreast of who that is. Wants to know if you're doing a live show somewhere tonight. So just a private call now asking Ricky. I am, yeah, but I don't want to say it now. Well, I've had one person. I've hit it on the office and often performs live at different venues around the country. So while those two take care of business. Alright, guys, have you finished that private call? Jeez, that was outrageous. You know, you're a fan of feng shui, Karl, and you believe it's all true. I'll just run this one past you just on the off chance maybe you change your opinion slightly. Fengshui teaches you to use your environment wisely. If your land and the surrounding area is undulating, it's said to house auspicious dragons. When land is flat and featureless, the dragon is missing and the land is said to be less auspicious. Excuse me. They call me the Brixton Dragon. Sure, sure. I seem to have lost my way. I know it's South London somewhere, but could you help me find my home? What's your name? Well, they call me the Brixton Dragon. Right. Where are you from? Oh, I see what you mean. I see what you mean. Oh, the Cayman says that. Does that, does that make you query at all the dragons? I'm not into it that much. Right, sure. Saying that if you have your head up one end of the bed rather than the other, it might make a difference to your night's sleep. It's not so much feng shui, though, is it? As sort of good advice generally, when you went home, don't. Don't sleep on the end of a spike near a cliff. I mean that, that's good advice, isn't it? I mean, when you went home and. The house was full of women, why did you. Why did you sleep on the sofa? Why did you not pop upstairs and. Sort of into a warm bed? Yeah, with a woman. Were they dressed? Or is your brother still sort of have those kind of parties or. I haven't seen him for years. Sure, sure, sure. Why is he living there? I don't know. Okay, what's his name? Mark. It's not. He's not. He's not known as, like, Moss side Mark, because that could be a clue. 10 Dorlish Roadmark. He's never out of prison long enough to get a nickname. Steady on. It's getting a bit heavy, innit? God. Is this what's motivated a lot of your anxiety? Yeah, the hair loss, that sort of thing. We always go a little bit too far, don't we? They're a bit dark at the end of the show. I know. Whilst. Oh, wow. Oh, Pete want a little bit of Muse. Yeah, if Pete wants it. I mean, I don't. I'm not a big fan. I don't mind muse. I've still not got over them then, doing that Summertime song. What was it called? Nina Simone cover, wasn't it? Yeah. Anyway, listen, let's not bring the show down. Let's play Muse and then we'll be Kensington. Plug in, baby. Let's enjoy it.",
