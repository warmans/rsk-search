There's some great tunes. Yeah, we've got our. There's too many to mention. Don't mention them. Well, there's. There's about 20, actually. Is there? We could mention them. Looking forward to them. I've got a brand new feature. Okay, well, you know, I'll do my film review. Loving it. And, you know, we do Run for the Covers and Song for the Lovers and got a new feature. That film sounds good, right? It's not the film review. It's a. It's a track from a film. That's brilliant, Rich. Yeah, that's absolutely. That film sounds good. Yeah, something like that. People will be desperately look forward to that. And there'd just be some chat as well. There'd just be some nattering. Carl, have we got anything to give away this week? No. Oh, it's a shame. Yeah. Quite like giving stuff away. Yeah. Makes me feel quite powerful. Does you know, in the week, is there any meetings, like, oh, what should we give, like Ricky and Steve to give away? Because, I mean, I'll see lots of trailers for the Breakfast show and that Enterprise and that. Or do they go. They go, who comes on Saturdays? Saturdays? I don't work Saturdays. No, but they're still on the air. Saturdays. Is it? Who listens on a Saturday? Yeah, between one and three. Oh, that's the worst time, isn't it? They sort of hear you taking the mickey out of what tickets you're given. And I think this week you could have had Saint Etienne, but they said, no, we'll hold them back. I love her being punished. Yeah. Yeah. I'll tell you what we've been punished for. For being subversive and rock and roll. Is that a crime, Rick? I don't think so. High five. You got to hit the hand. Sounds embarrassing. A lot taller than me, aren't you? Just hit high five. Yes. Mack Rebel Motorcycle Club. There in Love Burns. Xfm 104.9. We're really swinging now. We are so much better than last week. Last week was a point I don't want to talk about. Well, it wasn't too bad, actually, was it? Apparently, no. You know, I said, oh, we were really off and Steve was hung over and I was tired. We couldn't be bothered. And they were going, no, as good as any other week. Which is pretty disappointing. You want them to go, well, I'll tell you what, it was the worst one ever and it was still brilliant, as opposed to. It was one of the best, but rubbish. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Good. So we're gonna. Really. Yeah. We're gonna up up the ante today. Yeah. Come on, Carl, let's make this. Carl, let's make this the best show ever. All right. Should we have a big group hug? Yeah. Oh, Carl. Let's have a big group lick. Yeah, Carl, come on. Look at his little face. You can see why the ladies love him. No, you're a cute guy. And I'm not having a go. I genuinely think you are, so don't have a go back at me. Oh, I've got some news for you, Steve. Go on, where is it, Carl? Where's that thing? Right, yeah. Company magazine are compiling a 50 most eligible bachelor's feature. The May issue, 2002. Right. These are the requirements. Right. Single, right? That means available, not just unmarried. Age 20 to 30. You're well in there. I'm straight in there. C D. What was C? C? Is it says good looking, fine. Yeah. I'm eligible so far. And it says not. Oh, no. This is what rules you out, probably. It says not necessarily Brad Pitt esque. And you are a little bit. So they say it must be British and come from one of the following regions. London, southeast, southwest. That's me. I think they just name all the regions of Britain. Yes. They could just say from Britain. Really? Other employ. What? Sorry, Carl, go on. Is there a height restriction or something like that? Well, we're leaving. What is this? What? Is this a serious thing? What is it? It's the most eligible bachelor. This is so me. Do you know any of the boys who'd be perfect for us? Company girls. Past bachelors have included TV presenters. Derma O'Leary. Yeah. Hey, I'm in with Derma O'Leary. He knows me. He's normally on, isn't he? Yeah. Jamie thinks it's not. It's not. Most eligible person who knows a bachelor. The models, Rob Warrington and James Polanski. Yeah. The singers, Lyndon David hall and Richard Blackwood. Yeah. Wouldn't necessarily consider him a singer. Controversial. I'm sorry. He's having a dig at Blackwood. Hey, I'll tell you this. I was watching. All right. I don't suppose watch it, but I saw the trailer for the Farmer Wants a Wife. Oh, yeah, right. Which is the show which you mentioned. Yeah, you did. Which is a show where I think farmers. Because Obviously it's very difficult for them to meet with. Wants a wife. And I'm thinking, hello, idea. Steve Merchant wants a wife. It's not bad. It's a TV show who sounds a bit like a farmer. Exactly. This is what I'm saying is I don't mind the public voting for the woman, you know, if that's how it happens, I don't mind, you know, because who cares, you know, I'll do. I'll have anything, whatever they can choose be fine, you know. See that, I think. Yeah. Steve Merchant wants a farmer. That'd be even better. Steve Merchant wants it. Yes, he. Merchant wants it. I'm thinking sort of maybe the Bravo channel on cable. Yeah. You know, or ITV2. Yeah, it's an idea, Rick. I'm just flying up the flagpole. Yeah, we're thinking about that. Phone. Don't phone in. It's not worth it. Let's play some more music. There is a Slim Shady in all of us. That was Eminem XFM 104.9. Steve. Yeah, I was just. Actually I was just thinking because Carl, I'm probably thinking, you know, he likes to have a little dig every so often about, you know, my success with the ladies. No, no, no, I'd tell you, you'd have been proud of me last night. No, listen, you'd have been proud of me because I was walking back from the shops and I was carrying two cans of weak lager. It was Friday night. Rick. Yeah. Time to go a bit crazy. Yeah. And there's this woman coming the other way who must have been sort of 50, 55, just standing on the street dressed in kind of like rhinestone cowboy style outfit. Really weird. Never seen it before. Parton is it? Part. It wasn't Dolly. And she's just staggering down the road like she's ah, just shouting. And some truck drove by and she just went, oh, hey guys, come over here, come over here and. And the car just drove by, whatever. And she walks into me and she, she saw me coming and. And she saw the beer in my hand. She couldn't believe her luck and she stopped and she tried to stop me and I sort of stepped one side step one way to try and go past her. She stepped there and blocked my way. So she blocked the other way and she went, come here, come here. Like trying to motion. And I was really scared. It was like some you looked around. And thought beggars can't be Jesus. But then for a minute I was thinking, well, you know, I mean it's Friday Night. I'm in a mood to make whoopee. But I thought it's probably best to avoid it. And I actually managed to run away and avoid her and she just kept shouting at me as I was running down the road, come, come, come with me, come with me. Bi legged it. But what I was thinking is it was like some kind of like sort of Hansel and Gretel nightmare. Like an old lady in your way. You're going there and there's loads of other people that look just like you. Exactly. They're getting very, very thin. We've been here for years in chains. Yeah. Yeah. But I thought you'd be proud of me. Now there was that, that was, you know, that was a woman on a plate, so to speak, and. And I just turned it down and. Yeah, exactly. You see, desperate, he got in and went, what have I done? Seeing her again tonight. Well, I'm just gonna hang around by the offy, see what happens, you know. Looking forward to Christmas. Loving it. I'm always a big fan of Christmas actually, and I'm not a bad humbug time. It's not. It's not far now, is it? It's this month now, is it? Are we in just the first? Yeah. Geez. Yeah. Oh yeah. Geez. Jesus. Yeah, we. Brilliant. We. I was quite excited because this weekend, I think it was this week in the papers, the sun and I think all the other papers actually had the. The first of the kind of giveaway TV supplements that comes listing all the shows that are on. But one of the, when they bring them out this early is you open it and it's like you think, yeah, I want to see what films are on and stuff. And you go through and it just. About half of the listings are to be confirmed. To be confirmed. It's utterly. It's an utter waste of time. Yeah. And it's like. But it's like who is planning their film? Their film and tv watching this early? Yeah, it's a little bit early to. Be worrying about three weeks in advance going, oh, but I better not make any. Well, unless it's like a, you know, an amazing thing on telly, you know. Are you coming to a party? We got one Friday, 29th. I don't know, I'm gonna watch something on the TV. There's a good film. What is it? Not been confirmed yet. It's to be confirmed, but I can just, you know, I won't be at the party. Yeah, yeah. It's strange, but I remember when I was little, my sister Used to work in WH Smith's and she used to come home like every Thursday. She'd been paid. Big bag of sweets for me. And, you know, the TV Times. The TV Times, of course. Cause you're working class. The TV Times, the Radio Times. For a class. You're a middle class gentleman. Myself. But the bumper edition at Christmas, it's like two weeks of telly. She sit down that Thursday night, sit with my sweets and we tick off all the things we were going to watch over the next. Didn't happen, did it? Because I, you know, I was squeaking around, hyperactive, making people play on the toys stuff and not watching telly, really. I bet you. But if you watched any telly, it had been really rubbish stuff. The whole family was like, I imagine probably Dennis Norden's laughter file, Volume 12 or whatever it is. I don't think even Dennis Norden was going there. Whereas, you see, we, in our house, of course, we'd often not. We'd just switch off the TV and we'd just listen, you know. Concerto on Radio 3. Yeah. We weren't allowed to turn the telly off, really. I don't know what a concerto is. I've just said that word. I'm assuming what a concerto is it. It's like a. Just a posh word for concert, isn't it? I think so. Is it? It's one of those. Maybe it's one of those instruments, the kind of squeeze box that's a concertina. It's a concertina, yeah. Yeah. My nan used to play a concertina. Really? Yeah. I don't know if that's interesting to you. I don't know why you choose the concertina. Of all the instruments to play. And it's not the sexiest. Only kind of sailors. My man used to have one, but she doubled up as an iron lung. Nice. Which was good. And so when she, you know, once you had a bit of an attack, we not only were warned. Yeah. But we had a little tune that's beautiful as well. Yeah. Did you play your grand? You can play your grand. Yeah, yeah. She had a bit of an accident. She said, sit down, kids. And she came in there and she had a corrugated net, of course, where it's gone horribly wrong. Go on. Sorry. What are you gonna say? It's happening again, Steve. What's happening? It's going all wrong. We're talking rubbish, are we? Yeah. We should have played two in a row. He's having a go, isn't he? Blimey. Gorillaz Rock the house. Yeah. XFM 104.9. Who are you? Ricky Gervais. Who are you? Steve Merchant. Yeah. Nice. Sweet. Together again. I can't believe it. The old team, they said it never happened. Plus, Carl, he presses the buttons, not. Draw attention to him. We were talking about squeeze boxes. Yes. And got me to thinking, what's happened to him? You don't see them. So, I mean, instruments should be around forever, you know. I mean, the piano forte, it's around, you know, the saxophone was only, I think, the 20s or 30s, but, you know, I can't imagine it going away. There's a number of instruments probably dying out. Loot, the loot, the loot you rarely. See now, except maybe on a. Men Without Hats. What was Men Without Hats? Or Marillion. Right, right. We can dance if we want to. And Pierre Trudeau's daughter was in that video. Who was that we saw in the sandwich shop yesterday? Well, he might not want us. He might want to be people to know that he was in a sandwich shop. It's fine. It just shows that he. Bruce Dickinson, he didn't recognize him. I went, look, Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden. Had no idea. I'd say he's really tiny. It was almost laughable. Is he married? That annoy me. But he just alienated himself from a lot of heavy metal fans now because he's pretty much a guru. They never leave their bedrooms, Rick. Yeah, but they've got powers. They're putting crystals now on toads and they're going to turn you into a. All right, all right. Well, no, I was having a go. I wasn't having a go. I stopped myself, realizing it wasn't much of a threat. Right, go on. What else is dying out? Pipes. Pipes. You never see people smoking pipes. Young people now, not smoking pipes. No. You see old people, you're Right. But kids, you've got to start taking up pipes, otherwise they're going to die. Because people of the older generation, they're going to die soon. I'm not smoking a pipe. I should. Pipes, though, was it like the fact where when you smoked, you started, you know, at a young age and then carried on? Or did you just start at 50? But no, because if you see like, sort of shots of kind of, you know, sort of professorial types from the 1930s at. When they're at Oxbridge, they're always smoking pipes in a tweed jacket. Yeah, that was when they started, like universities. Yeah. But they still do lots of things that should die out in the rest of the world. Carry on in Oxbridge. Yeah, but my point is voters. All right. All I'm saying is that they're not even in Oxbridge now. They're not even smoking pipes. I bet there is. There's no one smoking pipes. I bet there is. I like the know if there's anyone listening who's under the age of 30 that smokes a pipe regularly. And I don't mean like a crack pipe. And I. And I guarantee they went to Oxford or Cambridge. Okay, what's the number? Oh, 8700-812-34. What's email, Ricky. Gervaisfm.co.uk Pipes are dying out. Snuff. That's as good as gone. Yeah, Snuff. Yeah. Trill biz. My friend always said if he won, like, loads of money on the lottery, he'd like to try really hard to try and bring back as a fashion accessory the cape. Because the capes are classy. I quite like the cape. The cape's brilliant because you can kind of, you know, kind of mask your face with it. Yeah, Dracula. Like, you can have it off, but still on and on, but still off. Exactly. Like a coat, you know? I mean, where you drape it over your shoulders and that can fall down. Carl, you're not a fan of the cape. You're turning your nose up at the cape. That's a madness. No pockets. Good point. You can have some kind of inner sort of smuggler's pocket, poacher's pocket. If they did that, I'd buy one. Well, I'll tell you what. That sounds good. It's. That sounds good. It's just gone. Our past sounds good. For a minute there, I was completely lost. Remind me again, what's. That? Sounds good. No, I got it. That film sounds good. Oh, yeah, that film sounds good. Right. This isn't my famous film review, which I've got coming up. Look forward to that. It's brilliant. Yes. It's quite a delicate subject, but I think I deal with it sensitively. Brilliant. This is. That film sounds good. Right. And I've taken. Remind us again what that is. What this. Well, it's. I'm gonna pick a song from a film that's on the. From the soundtrack. Right. I'm choosing a song from Jackie Brown. Okay. Great film. Yeah. Brilliant film. And this is across 110th street by Bobby Womack. It's fantastic. Wonderful song. You'll only like this if you're really cool. Yeah. If you're really cool, like, say, us. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Bobby Womack across 110th Street. It's great, isn't it? That's a lovely feature. That was. That's the first feature. Oh, that film sounds good. Brilliant. Yeah, yeah. I'm thinking of actually bringing out maybe a compilation of. I'd love to hear it. Song for the Lovers. What sort of things can we hear, can we expect in the future? I know you're a big fan. This is brilliant. He bought, right, the soundtrack to the film Braveheart, which is just kind of. No, let me just explain. Which is just kind of big orchestrated numbers. Right. James, as far as he's concerned, that's classical music. He's got a classical music CD in his collection. It's the music from Braveheart. Oh. Oh. I sit there and I think, yeah, I'd probably sort of lead my people's. Yeah, you know, he's obsessed with Braveheart. He actually sort of relates to William Wallace. He actually thinks, yeah, that's the sort of thing I'd be doing. Yeah. Is. What was it you were working out to the other day as well? He's, you know, he's got like a personal, like gymnast or whatever. It's. What's it called? Is it a gym? Gym expert, A trainer. You've got a personal. I box for this bloke. Yeah. He goes boxing in, like some underpass somewhere, right. Every day, like every single day he goes boxing. Right. And what was it you were training? What did you tell me you were training to this week? What music did you have on? Oh, my God. I. I have actually now, I never this. But I have actually gone red, haven't I? Yes. Right. It's very hard to embarrass. I was working out and training and boxing. Oh, my God. You're gonna have to play a record after this to the Rocky soundtrack. To the Rocky soundtrack. He's bought, right, a CD which has got the best music from all of them. Now, was it Eye of the Tiger or was it. It starts up with Eye of the Tiger, then it goes heart's on fire, that's me, sort of. Then it goes, dun, dun, dun, dun. That's da, da, da. Does any of your training with your trainer, does it ever involve you running through snow with a log chained to your back, like in rock? I often have to help Russian peasants cuz their cart horse is like fallen over, but I lift it up. Whereas the other fella, he's training in a posh gym, having injections. I'm not. I'm just like breaking rocks and punching dead cows. Where'd you get that? From. It's handy. Was it? Put it on. What is it? That's the. He can't hear cuz he's got. He's. Put your headphones on. Why was it. You'll love it. You'll love it. Yeah, that's magnificent. Yeah, that's now Ricky Gervais's theme tune. Yeah. Every time we start the show. We should just start with that. Win, Ricky, win. You two. Walk on. Gotta give it to him. Hated YouTube for about 15 years. I know, I know, but I love that one now. I just love the album. Ah, they can't put a foot wrong. Do you ever listen to the whole album? Because I know you tend to buy albums just for the singles when you could. Of course, just buy the singles. I know where he's going. I bought light funky ones. Oh, I wanted to say that. Yeah. I bought light funky ones because I like funky ones. Do you remember the lovely ones? That was about like a year ago. What did they do? They did Girl in a Green Dress. Girl on TV and Abercrombie. That one that go. Yeah, Summertime. Abercrombie and Fitch. The girls are wearing up. Do you remember that? It's like a light sort of summer. Listen, nonsense. I've got a lot of money. It's nothing to me. Okay, the light to funky. I want a bit of light funky ones once. That's 15 quid. It's nothing to me. He put the two singles on, right. Never listen to the rest of the album. I never listed the two singles again either. The light funky ones. Oh, it's just my street cred's gone down it. Rocky soundtrack and the light funky ones. You'd make two mistakes. Let's not forget Braveheart. The same track. Oh yeah. It's a good film. Rick, we were talking earlier about True. Story about a little Australian freed. The Scottish. The stuff that's dying out that we. I think you and I single handedly need to kind of resurrect and salvage. I thought the trilby was dying out. Yeah. I'll surprise you watching Top of the Pops last night. Yeah. Jamiroquai was wearing one and then lo and behold, Danny Minow came on. She had one as well. I thought, blimey, there's two people there trying to salvage the trilby and Good. Really? Well, that's on its way then Let them. Let's do something else. But the bowler hat. Ah, the bowler hat. Fancy myself. I love a bowler hat. Carl, would you wear a bowler hat? I know you'd wear the cape. I Did wear a trilby. You were trilby. Really? You must have looked like a. That's brilliant. What, because you're a Mancunian? Well, look, there was a phase one in about 90. When was it? I think that was just around your way. It might have been. It was in Manchester. They still get a job. Lot of trailbiz. And that persuades you kids. Yeah, yeah. I tell what's trendy. No. You know, now, Sean Ryder wears one of these. Does he? Yeah, yeah, go on. Yeah. Quid. And everyone in your street had trilvies on. But you've never worn a bowler. Never. What about kangal bowler you might think about again. I'll tell you what, I would like to wear a bowler hat, but I'm worried I look like one of those little fellas off the Home Pride advert. The Home Pride guys, they've been persevering with the bowler for years. They still look good in it, though. They're still looking good. They're dapper guys. Yeah. There's a lot of the Jolly Green Giant. He had quite a distinctive look, which is obviously what I've been thinking of exploiting what they're doing. Oh, that. I know. The little. Like a little dress that made up his little skirt. Yeah. What was the Jolly Green Giant so jolly about? Probably very pleased. It was kind of just been the sweet corn and the peas. Now, I reckon it was his enormous jolly green knot. I mean, he must have got up every day and gone, look at that. He must have been so hard. I think the only thing that's like in the case of Jolly Green Giant or like when Gulliver was a giant and he was in Lilliput and all the Lilliputians, like, they help him out. They were feeding him and stuff. Yeah. If you're a giant like that, in that situation, how do you sort of have a little sneaky tug, you know? A little tug. A little J. Arthur Rank. I don't know. Because it's like. It's very tricky. As big as their mountains, you can't hide. They go, oh. You know. I mean, there's no. There's no. All the little village probably just thought it was a tidal wave or something. That's pretty grim, though. Yeah, the tidal wave is pretty desperate. I know, it's. How would he have gone to the mayor and said, I need. I need a Kleenex the size of a tennis court. Yeah. And a gigantic copy of the Daily Star. Yeah. I never understood with giants, how they actually got that big in the first place. Because what food was around to make them? Because not only were they, like, big, big, but they were mostly big. They ate. Well, they ate whole. Cows, probably. Car. You know, it's not well documented car, is it? You know. You know, they don't actually exist and never have. Okay, right, it's time for a feature, I think. Oh, Carl, I've got. There was a TV show I watched once on the History Channel. This is the History Channel, yeah. It was the history of Werewolves. Right, the history of werewolves. And the whole show is predicated on the fact that at the end we'll tell you if they ever existed or not. Yeah, Just waiting. I go, come on, we're gonna be late. Hold on. He's gonna tell us if he's existed or not, Carl. Werewolves. Michael Aspel was in it, and Michael Aspel is a top broadcaster and therefore would not associate himself with something that did not exist. Under the covers, gents. Under the. COVID me up. Cover me. Bad run for cover. Here come the covers. Yeah, covers. I like cover songs. This is a cover version. Yes. This is from an album which is a bit hit and miss, as these things often are. It's different artists covering the songs of Leonard Cohen. You've got the Pixies on there, REM Nick Cave, different people. This, bizarrely, is Lloyd Cole. Not someone I'm normally a fan of, but doing a version. Doing a version of the fantastic Leonard Cohen song at Chelsea Hotel. Play it, Carl. It's beautiful. I don't think of you that often. Lloyd Cole doing his version of Chelsea Hotel under the covers. Under the covers of. Oh, it was a beautiful version. It's lovely, apparently. I think it's that song Sweet, written by Leonard Cohen originally, and I think it's about his brief romance with Nico, who made a name, of course, with the Velvet Underground and was a tragic drugs victim. But it's interesting because I'm looking at this as a compilation called I'm your fan, which is cover songs of Leonard Cohen's music. And as I say, REM, there's people on the Nick Cave who are still going. There's a couple of names you don't tend to hear of that often. Now, the House of Love. Oh, yeah. Rarely hear them, do you? That Petrol Emotion. Oh, yeah. That Petrol Emotion, yeah. Who else we got on here? It says Robert Forster. Now, is he a musician or is it. I don't. Robert Forster. Well, if you know who Robert Forster is, I thought he's a writer. The Lilac Time. The Lilac. They're on there as well, say a name. Ravan. And laugh. You can. If it's the lilac time. Well, did I tell you before that we. My friend and I once listed words we thought should be rude but aren't. Like Kasuk, we always talk to. Yeah. And. And he always pointed out the blow monkeys. Yeah. Which I was. It could be a very rude. But isn't it Isn't. That could be a new feature, couldn't it? We're featured up, aren't we? Aren't we? This is. We've still got the film review to come. Song For Lovers is coming up in a few minutes. Song for the Ladies. Yeah, Song for the ladies. If I can squeeze a hip hop track, I'd love to do it. Yeah, that's. That's called our hip hop track bit. Oh, it's just. It's just amazing. Classic song, Rick. What. What were you thinking of? I don't know. Maybe something by Nirvana. Well, there's. There's, well, their biggest classic. You mean ideally Smells Like Teen Spirit. It's going well, isn't it? I'm enjoying it. I'm enjoying it. Well, I'm looking forward to Pop Idol. Pop Idol? I've not been watching it. You're joking. Yeah. I don't know what's happened really. I've lost interest. Oh, well, it is like most things, like the. The preliminary rounds, all the real freaks and no hopers, you know, but some of. Sometimes I watch those sort of things and I sort of laugh and I think, oh, dear, I shouldn't be laughing because he's not just rubbish, he's verging on the mentally ill, you know, I mean, some of those people that go along, you want to go. Who. Who told you to go along? What? What were you thinking? Right. Well, it's the fact that there was no one to stop them going. That's what's even more terrifying. I know. And Simon Cowell's good. Oh, he's great value. He's amazing. Foxy. I like foxy. Now I know, I've warmed too. He's come around, Dr. Fox. He's a lovely little sh. Now, often I notice he's not always there. We can't. Weak. Is that because he's off doing medical operations? He's got his practice. He's got to practice. He's got to maintain that. Yeah. And you know, it's the big ones tonight. I mean, when I say the big. One, Capital Ray, he's still on Capital Radio. Yeah. That he's got to do. So, you know, Isn't it some of. The big names, though? It's Darius Dinesh. Tonight, it's Darius in the Fat Boy. And the Fat Guy. The big thing that makes you. Well, I notice in the sun today is saying, vote for me because of my musical talent, not because I'm huge and you feel sorry for me. Yeah. Well, that's good. I think that's right. But he has got a great Darius. I noticed he shaved his beard off. He looks. He's. He's a new man. He looks slightly laughable, though. He's got quite a weak chin. He's having a laugh. Well, he's dissing Darius. I'm not claiming to be a pop star. Well. Oh, can you feel the love in the room? Yeah. Let's have a little song. No, but I'm looking forward to it. My favorite all the way through has been the Little Fellow with a Stutter. I'd like Darius to get. Yeah. I think he's. It's almost certain he's going to win. I don't think so. Or that Welsh girl. It was very good. The one that made Pete Waterman cry. Yeah, that was great. She was good, though, wasn't she? Yeah, they're great. They're really good. But, you know, it'd be nice to see Fatty get somewhere. I mean, he's just a weird shape, though. It's. It. It turns my stomach and I'm one to talk. No, I know. It's just, you know, he's just doing his job. It's, you know, glandular. Yeah. It's not as greed, but, you know, he's got a good voice and why not? We've got good luck to him. We've had Demis, Russos in the charts. Yeah. Alison Moyer. There's not been a fatty for a while. I say, who's been a big star? I mean, Moye May would have been the last one. Jerry Watson, she sorted herself out after becoming famous. She was pretty big, wasn't she? Who, Jerry Halliwell. Yeah. She was never a bloater. Have you seen this bloke off Pop Idols? It's like he's got three. Jerry Hallowell strapped to his waist and then wearing a big coat over the. Top to smuggle them in to a no Halliwell zone. I reckon he's. I tell you what he's gonna do. I reckon he's gonna take it off and it's just a big fanfare and it was like. To prove, you know, the prejudice of the world. Yeah. All right. Yes. Hey, and how come that little fella with a starter doesn't stutter when he's singing? Hold on, hold on. Well, that was. That's cleaned up. Actually. She's not even Welsh exactly. Is. Apparently Darius is not a knob. Dandy Warhols on XFM 104.9. About 20 past 2. The Ricky Gervais show with Steve Merchant. Yeah, he's still here. The Christmas ads have come on. I notice they're on now. And I noticed. I was watching last night, watching tell you last night. And do you think that the advertising executive for Cabrera's Roses Chocolates just comes in once a year and they go, what you got this year? And he goes, what about some workmen and some old ladies singing thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. Just shot in the street somewhere. Yeah, that'd be fine. It worked last year. Yeah. Every. I've been going like. Like since I can remember. They've never. I've never seen another advert for cabbage roses. Except that. Exactly. There's certain things that conjure up Christmas, like you got your turkey and all that, and you got your roses. Yeah. Walrus. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, dear. Pizza. Pizza. Woolworths. Drink driving. Oh, dear God. Sorry, I forgot what I went in for. What are we doing? We were doing something. Be careful. There's a lot of money involved here. Steve, did you. I was reading the paper this week that Charlotte Church. Yeah. You know, a little kind of singing sensation. She's been slagging off the firemen who've been salvaging people and stuff. No, but I saw the news. I saw the news that she apparently. And she claimed that she'd been misinterpreted. Right. But the Channel 5 news thought this was a big enough story to say that Charlotte Church had been saying that the September 11 tragedy had been blown out of proportion. Right. She's been just lagging off the firemen. No, but that's what they said. They said that she. She felt that they. They were being hailed as kind of heroes and they were just doing their job. Right. Oh, well, that is. That's. Yeah, that's a little bit stupid to say anyway. A little bit insensitive and. Yeah, yeah. But it's sort of because it's like. Did you read about. Why do you care? Why does anyone care? But who she thinks about September 11 anyway? It's the same as things like during a presidential election or when I'm accident. It's these things they picture. Billy Piper says I've always voted Labor. Who's gonna go, go war. Hold on, hold on. H. From steps. He's a conservative. What's going on? I don't know if he is or not. You know, that was just an example. I don't know what either of them vote, to be honest. All right, let's not get into it. Yeah. I think Faye and Claire from Sets are both BNP members. I can't. I remember reading that somewhere. That's. But so untrue. He takes that back now. I cannot be certain. Right. I think that is definitely untrue. I read it on the Net and it's often wrong on the Net. Right, Definitely. Definitely. He's gonna retract that now. Definitely. Yeah. What I'm saying. I'm saying I. It's almost certainly untrue. I read it on the Net. Oh, right. Yeah. And those things are always untrue. Okay. All right. He's dissed the Net now. You dissed the Net. I can't believe it. Did you dig ourselves out of this hole now? Well, Blue, now, I definitely can quote this because I read it in the Sun. Yeah. Blue were being interviewed by. You know, Blue, the pop band Blue All Rise. Have you bought that album yet, Rick? I imagine that would be on your. I like it. One for the money and the free ride. Anyway, Blue, we're being interviewed by the sun for. When they're going to web chats by the lovable Dominic Mohan. Yeah. And for some reason, they got back to September 11th and one of the members of Blue said, again, church, like. Yeah, I think he's been blown out of all proportion. What about all the whales and elephants that are dying every day? And the other van were going, shut up. Yeah. It was funny. They gave me a transcript of it going, shut up. They had to do a retraction. He said, sorry, I didn't know. Yeah. He said, obviously, I'm very passionate about whales and elephants and perhaps a bit misplaced. All the proceeds that I'll receive from our next single, I'm going to give to the September 11th Foundation. Yeah. And then he went, can I give some to the Wilds? Now you've done it again. Don't worry about the wilds. But this is what I mean. Why are people asking the members of Blue. Yeah. You know, or Atomic Kitten what they think about September 11th? I know. They should just be working in a chippy, those people. They're lucky. They're lucky to be on the telly. Except the Atomic Kitten girls, really. I mean, do they not look like they should be in a Chip shop or just hanging around outside an offy, drinking. They'll be soon. They will be soon, don't worry. Although Hearsay's new single. I dissed Hearsay before, but they've come out with a, you know, a little poppy thing, I think. Can I surprise you, Rick? I prefer Liberty. I prefer Liberty as well. A little bit funky, a little bit with kids. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, XFM 104.9. Once again, our opinions on current pop bands. If you'd like to have your hold. On, though, isn't it about time for what? You know, a hip hop track. Have we got it? Can you get A Song for the Lovers? Would be good. Oh, I'll do that now. Now, this is a beautiful song. It's by Simon and garfunkel. It's only 1 minute 49 long. It's. It's called April Come, she Will. It's the song for the lovers. April Comes, She Will. So isn't that beautiful? Beautiful little song. See, I'd quite like to put out a compilation, like Song for the Lovers, maybe. You know what I mean? But I'm worried, obviously. The title's ironic. We're taking the mickey out of those things, but quite serious about all the songs we play. Yeah, exactly. I'm worried about people that seem a bit like Simon Bates's Our Tune album or something. Steve Wright's Sunday Love Songs. Yeah, yeah. But, yeah, when you think that you. Listen to some dance track, you buy it and it's like five minutes long. The same thing. Repetitive beats. Yeah. And then you hear that. A minute and a half classic. Do you know what I mean? Hey, have I made my point, Rick? I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, the youngsters. If anyone knows what my point was there. Yeah. Phone in and he's made it. Well, yeah. Carl, have you got what you got lined up for us? Some REM. Strokes on XFM 104.9 show with me, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington, the K Man. Well, it's time for that. Well, I think people wait for this. Now, I never knew really, since I was doing the show that I actually had a bit of a knack for film reviews. Right. Do you know what I mean? Because, yeah, I mean, I'll probably. Probably be asked soon by Barry Norman or Jonathan Ross to do something on that sort of thing or maybe my own film. So, I don't know, TV or the Clock's Ticking. It's only a matter of time. Yeah, okay. This week I've chosen. Well, wait a minute, let's play the jingle. Okay. The film review and that. I'm brilliant. Yeah, because your face. Yeah, yeah. Okay. There we go. This week I've chosen My Left Foot. Right. Okay. Now My Left Foot is a film about a bloke called Daniel Day Lewis who's all mental except for his left foot. Right. But. And he has arguments. I can't remember his dad, so I wasn't watching it properly. But he. Even though he's mental apart from the foot, he does stuff with the foot that we could. We're not, you know, could do all over. And he uses that to his best. I think he might write a book or something off paint. And the moral of this story is, you know, even if you're. You've only got a foot that works, you can still win prizes because it won the Oscar. Okay. Am I right in saying that you're bringing a book out of these collected maybe for the Christmas market? I think I might, yeah. Yeah. I see there's reviewed sort of in. What with. It's a different. It's a different outlook on it, a different approach. I'm just. I don't just sort of like stray. Well, I'll tell you what. It's an approach that doesn't really use grammar which. Which you don't see that often in film reviews. But. No, once again, what would you give out of 10? I just. I didn't really concentrate. I can't remember a lot about it. It. But it won an Oscar so I think it won an Oscar summer. So nine. Okay. That was My Left Foot which probably available on sell through video. Maybe in a bargain bin. 5.99. Probably on TV this Christmas, that's to be confirmed. Eels fresh feeding on XFM104 point. I was going well in it. I'm enjoying it. Yeah. 20 minutes to go. I think, you know, more of an up show. We've made some great hits and great songs. We've got some great features. A new feature. That film sounds good. Looking forward to it. That A Run and Run Songs. If there's any record companies out there, they want to put out a compilation of my songs for lovers. Yeah, that's good. Anyone who wants me to do a film. Anything. Any film you want. Yeah. Reviewed yet? Reviewed, yeah, yeah, yeah. I would finish the sentence. Yeah. No idea. Because it was. Otherwise. It was. Anyone who wants me to do a film, of course. Sure. Okay. Yeah. And that. You're running out of steam. I can. You're running out. Yeah, yeah, go on, Carl. Have you seen it yet? I know you probably Haven't Rick. Cliff Richards video for his new single. Yeah, it's amazing, isn't it? I saw it on Lorraine Kelly in the Morning Sky. One great show. And, and it's amazing. It's. It's. He's done a version of Somewhere over the Rainbow but he's combined that, he's combined that with what's. It's. Oh, what? Oh, what a Wonderful World. I wasn't really listening. I was looking at the pictures. It's what a Wonderful World and combined with Somewhere over the Rainbow. So he's done it. Two classic songs. Two songs that have been done definitively. Yeah. Artists in the past he's tried to combine with a kind of Yamaha keyboard sound in the background. What was his last year's one? It was Lord's Prayer with Over the Old Langsai. He's just obsessed with combining two songs. Like they're not good enough as they are. People to get bored. We better combine them. Yeah, yeah. It's like, like a megamix, like a Cliff Megamix. And he's right. The video is unbelievable. It's him flying through. It's all kind of sort of 2D animation, kind of almost sort of a collage of buildings and high rise flats in. Kids see him floating by, they wave, they point to each other. They can't believe. They look. There goes Sir Cliff. They're going, who's that? He was around in the 50s and. He'S just, he's got a little one dimensional cliff with a kind of angelic glow flying through the sky, just bringing happiness to people. As he sings. Oh, he does is real face kind of every so often kind of appearing. I wonder where his real face is. And it's, it's one of the worst songs and one of the worst videos I've ever seen. I mean I know people slag off Cliff and it's an easy target, but he actually deserves it because he's shameful. Yeah, he's embarrassing. Yeah, he's embarrassing. I mean he's arrogant. Well, everything's a disguised boast. I mean I, you know, I like Devil Woman, I like miss you nights. I liked Wired for Sound and I like tall speakers and small speaker, you know. You know. You know I like all sizes speakers, you know that you'll. You'll vouch me on that? Yeah. And he sang about it, which is good. And you know I'm often wired for sound. Right. Carrie doesn't liver anymore. Where's she gone? She's just another message on a payphone wall. It's a story. But lately I haven't had a lot of time for him. Awful. I remember he was on something on one chat show and I think it was Dares or Michael. And I said, so you had something? He said, yeah. He said, well, everyone knows that Elvis sold more records after his death than when he was alive. Little dig there against Elvis. Yeah, well, I've just overtaken his record for sales in the uk. Right. So he sets up the Alvis. Alvis is only selling because he's dead. Yeah. And anyway, I've still beaten him in the uk. Yeah. Yeah. And where'd you get. And where'd you get the quiff from? And the way to sing? Where'd you get that from, Cliff? What do you think of that? But it's those people who. He's just desperate for the credibility that he's never gonna have. I like it. When he went around last year going, they're not playing my record. They're not playing my record. They're not playing. Oh, go on, play it. Number one. Yeah, it was number one. The Millennium Prayer. I know, yeah. Well, it was, you know, it was the millennium, wasn't it? It was, but I don't know who's buying it. I mean, I don't. You seem to claim it's some kind of like 60 year old women, but then. Yes. Are they really a commercial force now? Yes. Car seems to know that. Well, like when you're born, you're a little baby, wrinkly and stuff. When you get older, you sort of morph into a baby again and you go through the same phases. So when you're young, you buy singles, you get old, you got nothing to do all day, you got all your pension money. What will I buy? Cliff Richards on the telly? Here's my video Buy Me song. You see, that started off as quite a sensible point because I actually think they do it. But what was all that alien stuff about? When you're born you go wrinkly and you go wrinkly against it. Sometimes you mix like normal things that human beings say with I don't know what. Well, look, when you're a baby, you've got a little bald head, no teeth, you get old, what happens? Are you a philosopher? Are you an actual philosopher? Because, I mean, it sounds like it. Oh, Carl, play a record, you're a jam, you're a diamond. Xfm 104.9. Good to hear the Happy Mondays again. We're nearly through. We are indeed. We've had a little bit of chat We've had a few laughs, we had a few tears. We have indeed. We've. We've introduced a new feature. Looking forward to that next week. Yeah. So soon it's just going to be wall to wall features, isn't it? It's going to be. Ah, well, I had my different feature which you didn't seem to like, which was Something Old, Something New, Something borrowed, Something Blue. You want to explain it and. Yeah, something old, an old song. Something new, a new song. Yeah, Something borrowed, a cover version. Yeah. And Something Blue. That's a melancholy and beautiful song. Right, okay. But does it have to be all four or can it be anyone? No, it's all for you. Play that over the course of the show. Or maybe just have a set four songs in a row and that's that section. So, so that. So like, feature would be like, this is either an old song or the new song. Yeah, that's good. I think we've done that a few times. No, it's not, it's not covered. That's. Well, what's the difference? Play. Oh, I'm playing a song from a film. Just because you give it a title. It's just a song from a freaking planet anyway. Couldn't you. Brilliant. It's all nonsense, you see. Cheers, Carl. Brilliant. Yeah, my ideas are good, aren't they? Because they're not only sort of accessible but there's a little bit of depth there. I think it's fair enough to let him have his little feature at the end of the show though. Just, you know, I mean, keeping happy. This song for the lovers. Excellent. Well, that's. Yeah, but that's not till after song two by. I remember the days when Carl didn't even want to be on the air. I remember the days when he wasn't. He was told by the establishment that he wasn't allowed to talk on the air and now it's like he's. As far as he's concerned, he's a third member of the team. He's protected by me. Right, yeah. Cheers. Song two by Blur. We're running out of time. It's five, two. Just got time for Steve's Song for. The Ladies Wedding Present. Rick from the album Saturnali. I think it's pronounced like that. And it's track three, Dream World. Looking forward to goodbye. I don't know how many times.",
