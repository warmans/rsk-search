  "text": "Well, there's the best band in Britain, in my opinion. Big words. The Darkness Growing on me on XFM 104.9, I'm Ricky Gervais, with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilgrim. Have you got the album and already they've had an argument? Yes, well, I mean, I don't know whether we need to cheapen the show by discussing it, but I asked for a particular track, Carly's the producer, and he failed to get it for me. He's failed to get it for me, he's failed to bring it up from the record library. Completely failed in his mission. He had to get two records and he failed to get one of them. A 50 error rate there. Yeah, but like I said, I looked in the system, he told me what album it's on. I brought that album up. I'm busy. But okay, so, fine, fine. You're absolutely fine then. That's no problem. You know, Once again, that's a great excuse, Carl. Brilliant. The show has been ruined. It's been partially ruined, but you've got a bit of an excuse. All right. I didn't make a big deal out of it when you said, oh, and whilst you're down there, get us a new 50 cents. I never, I never said why you don't get this new 50 cent single. I asked you. A 50 cent single was lying around. If it hadn't been here, I wouldn't have worried. So I get it. Yeah, I did that for you. Right. When I come up, you say, has it got swearing in it? Well, I don't know. It's five to one producer. It's the brand new single. I thought it'd be lying around in the XFM office anyway, but I don't. I don't have time to sit around, listen to music. Sure. Well, yeah, right. I know that you have now you've got an ipod that can hold 7,500 songs. I don't know when you're gonna get round to loading all them on, but I haven't got the time. Busy, busy. Yeah, fine, okay. No, no, that's a perfect excuse, Carl. Well done, mate. I just hope that I never have to depend on you in a real emergency. I had a bit of a bad luck as well. I wanted to play REM and maybe the listener can help me here. Can you email in ricky.gervais fm.co.uk if you knew what. Know what song I'm thinking of? It's an REM song. I think it's on the Al of the last one before and he says Mulholland Drive and I'm Steve McQueen. That's all I know. I'm sorry, I can't think of the title. So we can't. I need the title to look it up, if you know what I mean. I can't put in like that. I can't put in Mulholland Drive assistant because. What are you talking about? So I need the actual title of the song to look up to find it down in the library. Otherwise go down yourself. If you're going to go down to the library and get that, I would. Send Carl because Ricky Gervais fm.co.uk But. If you wanted to, he did have time because he came in at 21st 12 rather than 5 to 1. Yes. No, I told you about that record that I wanted it yesterday, didn't I? So you. About 24 hours notice. So that's not really an excuse, is it? But I did find one of my favorite songs of all time, which is Bones off the Benz album and his Radiohead on XFM1 at 4.9. And there it is. Cuz you gave me lots of time to find it. Sure, sure could have brought it himself. No swearing in it. Bones, Radiohead, The Bend on XFM 104.9. And thanks to Paul Uzi, there's a. Whole bunch of other people, Davey, Steve, Ashley. It's Electrolyte, you know, it all comes flooding back now we've got that. I've got it out of the library. We're going to play that. That's done. It's interactive. I've used the listener, I've shown the listener. Right. I've helped them to help themselves. I've said if you want to hear it, tell me what it is. They told me what it is. They're going to hear it. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? Perfect. So going down the library and. Well, we don't. Yeah, well, we know mistakes can happen if that, you know. Yeah. And I mean I, I checked it though to make sure it was the right one. You see, it's just a little bit of. Well, it's a good rule that generally if you pick something up, a cd, you know, we want to play on a radio show, you normally check, you know, we check at the back. Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah. If you want a job done, do it yourself. You're absolutely right, Carl. So anyway, look, we're all. Let's all make friends, let's kiss and make up. Yeah. Touch and makeup. Yeah, let's. Let's just well, I'm, I'm. I'm up on Carl at the moment because it was my birthday in the week and not only has he brought me a little vibrating thing to put on the chair, cuz I got a bad back. So that vibrates that we can hear it. Yeah, yeah. I'm going to do it between records now. Right. What's that doing to you? As you. As you. It's just it sort of like sends a little pulse into his sort of muscles relaxer, doesn't it? I've got to relax on air. If I'm relaxed, the listeners relax, we're all happy. Sure. He's also got me this little electronic bongos and I thought we could do like, oh, chimpanzee that monkey news. So it's like a jungle sort of thing. Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah. Brilliant. Well, that's actually one of the great jingles for even her. So I've got the vibrating. Oh, chimpanzee that monkey news. Dr. Fox, if you're listening, I think you'll know that's a clear improvement. So thank you for those. It's all right. What did you. Did you get him? What did I get him? I. I couldn't get anything. I was too busy buying myself an ipod. You're joking. Well, it's a little bit gay, isn't it, giving gifts to blokes? Yeah, it is. But for someone who's like major. Player. Someone who's major? What do you mean someone who's major? Well, because he's a major celebrity. No. Made you. Oh, made you. Crazy. Beat Blur. All right. On XFM 104.9. Brilliant. Yeah. So I also got. Jane got me a few nice presents, including my favorite of all of them, a real bow and arrow. A real bow and arrow, yeah. Right. And what you, you know you're gonna rob from the rich. Yeah. I just gotta make the little outfit. You and your merry men. She's got me like two yards of green felt. Sure. Yeah. And I've just gotta find a tree. House. Someone who can make me a lovely little natty outfit. Yeah. Why is she. What you're. Hey, you live in central London, so where are you going to be using? We've got a garden. I did it yesterday. I've hurt my finger though, because I might put protector. So it's just. Oh, it goes so fast in it, I think. I'm sorry, I didn't understand that sentence. I'm here in the studio, I saw you point to your finger, so I'm guessing from that maybe you injured your finger. Yeah, for the listener again. What exactly were you talking about then? No, because when you put it back. Okay, so. And do you have a target? What do you use? I've got a big. The big cardboard box flat on it down the tree. Right. Oh, it's brilliant. Getting a bit excited thinking about it. Yeah. No indeed, because when I make that outfit, I'm going to be running around. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So do you have a. Do you have a picture like a face maybe on the target? Like Ozama bin Laden, something like that? Yeah, sure. No, it just says this way up. Fragile. Right, okay. I forget what came in it, but you know, it's good, good fun in it, Carl. Bow and arrow, isn't it? Yeah. Would you like a little bow and arrow? Yeah, it's all right. Yeah. First I had a rifle as a kid. Did you? A real one? Yeah. Just shooting cans and stuff. Yeah. Well, a wonderful anecdote. Well, we went. I went out with a drink with Carl in the week and we went to a restaurant, didn't we, Carl? It's a good night. And we sat there and next to me, when Carl came next to me was. What's his name? Ross Kemp. And he was sitting there and I saw Carl and I tapped him on the shoulder whilst. And I pointed to Carl and him, I said, it's nice to see you two back together again. Nice. And. And Carl was horrified. But Carl didn't know that I'd already spoken to him before Carl arrived. I thought it was okay. I thought I could break the ice cuz I've met him before. So he just thought I was insulting him. And in the week we were talking about his head, his little head, weren't we, Carl? And Carl suddenly stopped the conversation, said, if I had hair, what would we be talking about now? I think he had enough of everyone talking about it. He looked good, though. He had a special little do. He had it sort of, you know, cropped a little bit more. I like it when he's just freshly added down. Do you like. Has that ever happened to you, Steve, when you, if you're somewhere, say, if you sat somewhere, does someone sort of, you know, is he anyone else who you look like or would you say you're a bit of a one off? I love these two. But to be fair. To be fair, he seems to be having to go at me an awful lot more than I do at him now. I mean, he just starts it, you know, he just starts it out of nowhere. Yeah, I think, I think his is Sort of a get back for the way, you know, treat him as a producer. Not, you know, but he's not a producer. If he produced the show, I wouldn't, I wouldn't have a reason to criticize. But I think this is it. But I seriously, I mean, it really winds me up though because, you know, it started as a joke, but now it's just, it's abuse. Yeah. It got annoyed at Heat because it said Carl, producer. Well, not so much a producer as just a bald mank. And he went, can they say that? Yeah, can they say that? See, that's a magazine, an independent publication. It's identified what exactly it is you do. Yeah. There we go then. Come on, bring it on, because here we go. He's looking at me. I know he's thinking. I can hear the concept. I'm not thinking anything, especially that. That is true. Never a true word. Play a record. Now that I listened to. I heard this on VH1 in the week and I have not been able to get out of my head and I, I really kind of want to. I want to get in everyone else's mind now so they understand the, the pain I've been going through. Miss you by the Rolling Stone. I've. Been holding that so long, I've been sleeping all along. I hope that's now embedded in your brain and you can ruin a week by having to sing that constantly irritating people in shops and everywhere you go. Miss you by the Rolling Stones Good. Track, Good track, Carl. Jonathan Ross came out of this. Last. Week and we were talking about stuff and Carl was mesmerized when Jonathan told a story that he was bored once in a hotel room and shaved his ass. He shaved his ass. Yeah, sure. And Carl, you didn't stop questioning him, did you? About. I just wondered at what point do you sort of say, oh, this is getting on my nerves. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. It's way too long in his socks or whatever. Yeah. But it's not. I mean, it is boring in hotel rooms because. Told you before about when I was in Edinburgh and had nothing to do. There's nothing on the telly and you sort of. You've eaten the shortbread biscuits and so that's when I read the, the phone book to see how many. That's when you read the phone book. Well, to see how many Max were in Scotland. Yeah. And it was like, you know, 42 pages. Yeah, yeah. Jonathan. I don't know if he'd already done that. Yeah. And yeah, he said he he shaved his ass. Now when we say shaved his eyes, not his cheeks. He's. All of it. Yeah, all of it. Say that I think, but other than the cheeks. But then there's not much left. But then we got to the fact that me and Jonathan, if we pulled our wealth, we could have shaved Carl's ass for a thousand pounds, right? And he said, yeah, for a thousand pounds you can shave our ass. Can I? Suzanne said, can I say this bit? Your girlfriend said, what? Cole? She was annoyed. She says, well, I'm not allowed to go there. Why, is anyone else? Of course, the whole table stopped and leant in and said, what? He doesn't like me touching him there. I went, what do you mean? This is too much information. It was too much information. I like the fact that you've had this conversation with her. I like the idea that she touched your ass once and you went, woo, hands off. Yeah, I love you but keep your. Hands away from me arse. Do you know why? He said, he's talking about the most intimate part of the ass, the mid last. He's talking about that you. And he said. I said, why? He went, it's a bit gay in it. I said, how can a girl touching it be a bit gay? Stood behind you. It could be anyone. Oh God. And it seemed, I mean you can imagine the conversations we were having, right? And it just, it's that thing that the waitress heard something every time she came over. She heard the words car, go on. Jonathan Ross saying, I shaved my ass. Yeah, yeah. And oh dear. But it was, yeah, it was a good night, wasn't it? So it's the thousand pounds now, innit? But presumably you give Suzanne half anyway so everyone will be happy you've used the ass to best effect. She's got. She's got half out of it. So she's. She's made as much out of your ass as you have in a sense with me and Jonathan. Yeah, but to be fair, it's his arse on the line. I know, but I mean, you know, she's not like she's getting a bum deal. Well, she's getting 500, you know. Yeah, Quid. No, I understand that, but do you reckon. Just thinking of some more. Can I just ask, before you play a record, if we were to shave your ass, let's say we did it for charity or something, got sponsorship, how would we do it? Would we use one of those big kind of old fashioned razors? No, no, I'd use a Bic safety. I just straight on Would you use. A gel or a foam? No, no, I just. First of all, yeah, I think I just lather it up. So you lather up his eyes first? I do the outside bits, just goes straight down, big broad strokes, clean. Right. Then I'd have to go in the crevices and I'd need an assistant. I'd pop it apart and just very gently go in there. I might even use electronic equipment just so there was no sort of like nicks. Okay, so an electric razor or I. Might wax the internal middle ass. How did Jonathan do it? Because he did it on his own, didn't he? I see his mirrors. Why do we. I'll ask him, we'll call him later. But I don't know. Well, perhaps you, perhaps you listening, have once shaved your arse, maybe during an exam or something. What I think, and this is conjecture, but I think he was probably there, he'd had a shower, he's shaving his face, Right. And thought he was naked. Looks down and goes, oh, what a hairy ass. Well, I've got the razor in this hand, I got the mirror there, you know, I'm not, I'm not on stage for a good 10 minutes. Yeah. There's one thing I don't like going on stage with is a hairy ass. Bang, drink wallop. Done on stage. Thanks. See you later. See you next week. Yeah. What are you thinking, Carl? No, it's just if that. How airy was it? You know what I mean? How airy was it? Because I imagine, I mean you're saying mirrors and stuff, but is it. He's, I mean, how old is he now? He's 42. And they say your, your testicles drop quite a bit once you start getting old. Yeah. So that he's got to make sure they're out of the way. Yeah. I don't think, I mean, I can speak for myself and I was a similar ace, Jonathan, that, I mean, you know, there's millimeters in it. It's not like we tuck them in our socks in the morning. They're still in the same place. You really wouldn't know the difference. It wouldn't. If we filmed it in, you know, time lapse camera. They wouldn't. It would be like a bungee jump, do you know what I mean? They wouldn't be moving a lot. Yeah. All right. Do you think he's a. I told him he's a. He's a good looking fella. Steve, would you, would you agree with that? I told Jonathan that he said that he. And he he just went for it as well. Yeah. So you, you, you've spent a lot of time picturing Jonathan's naked ass. You'd let him give you money for. For ass touchery? Yeah. Where's your girlfriend's got no chance. And you're saying he's a good looking man. Do I play a record and think about what you've done. Interesting, energetic people. They all sparkle as they're walking down the street. 50 Cent, 21 Questions, new single from him. Well, my. Me and Carl got a joint. Favorite lyric now. I love you like a fat kid loves cakes. Yeah, that's great. I mean, I like it because it's funny and humorous and cheeky. You like it because it, it's, it means something, don't you? It actually. You think that's the absolute truth. If someone was to say that to you, that would be the most romantic thing they could say in it because it's. Oh, I'm just thinking that's, you know what it means. It's like the Elephant Man. The Elephant man, that's what it's called again. You know what you're gonna get? The fat kid loves cake. You've said it all. You don't have to say anymore. I can't believe it. I'll tell you what made his day the other day. I love it. Jonathan Ross said the Elephant man is one of the best films ever made. Yeah. Endorsed by a celebrity. I know. Well, by a film buff. Really. It is good though. It is a really good film. Yeah. We have got Cheeky Freak of the Week. All right. A lot of stuff going on this. Week in the free world. Yeah. Is it really? Yeah, there's loads. I mean, stuff that we can. The one that hasn't made it. God, this is what this. So this is where it hasn't made it. So we'll judge it on that. Go on. There's a woman. Right. You know how. I mean, in a way I thought Elephant man, it was a bit tight because, you know, they sort of took him on a freak show, did a bit of a road show with him and stuff. There's some woman, I think she's in India like now, who makes a lot of money because she's got three legs and like seven toes stuff. And she was saying people pay quite a lot of money. Not Squiddy Patel. It'S not that much money like compared to here. But over there it's like loads of money. Sure. And all you do is you go around to our house and you pay this lot of money. And people just go, extra red. Right. It's quite a lot of money in that. So she hasn't even got to go out on the road anymore, like in the old days. That's what annoyed me. It's like, well, you could get to them faster. You go and see them if they're paying the money. Oh, but, yeah, what she could do is go in and buy a pair of shoes, right? And then Nick went on the way out, because they only put one out, don't they? Good idea. So she could get, you know, two, three for the price of two. Just one of the many perks of having three legs. Having three legs. The other one is, I mean, keepy uppy. But she'll be good at that. She just stays at home, puts her feets up. But anyway, that's not even cheeky. Freak of the week. That's coming up later. Coming up later. Oh, brilliant. Now, Rockbusters. Dead in the water, isn't it? We've killed that off. Have we officially killed off. What have we killed off? Monkey News and Rockbusters. Didn't I tell you that there was some sort of petition for Monkey News? Was there? What was a lot of. Oh, there's loads of. Loads of emails and that. You mean you've done Monkey News? You mean you want to do Monkey News? No, but seriously, there's uproar and people were like, you can't get rid of Monkey News. Yeah, don't be doing that. Was it monkeys trying to write the complete waste of Shakespeare. Did Tony Blair get a whiff of it? And he's. He's coming down with a ton of news and Rockbusters. Steve, if you've got a better competition, then we'll do yours. That's fine. Do you know what I mean? If that's what you want to do, we'll do. What? What did you want to do? No, I was just wondering whether we should perhaps not do a quiz at all, rather than do that piece of rubbish. Might be better to have nothing. Might be better just to have silence during that part of the show than have Rockbusters. I don't know if we should discuss it. If I give you the clues and that, and if you think they sound rubbish, we're not doing it. Well, I know that. I guarantee they're gonna sound rubbish. All right, let's make it the last Rockbusters, then. This is the last Rockbusters. Well, it depends. This is. Okay. This is your. If it's good, you get a reprieve. It's all about this. Okay. Okay. Go on, then. Let's do Rockbusters, then. I'm doing it now. Should we play a record and do it after that? Do it after. Well, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you the prizes and then we'll come back with the clues because I've dug. Up that REM track. Excellent. So it's an interactive show. Okay. We've got the best summer holiday album ever. What we got on there? It's got Elvis versus Junkie xl. That's brilliant. Holly Valance is on there. Las Ketchup is all the stuff that the XFM listener is craving. Tribute to the Ramones album. We got Red Hot Chili Peppers are on there. Metallica. Street Legal from Bob Dylan. That's nice. Brilliant. Did you just buy that in the four? For £20 from HMV. Deal. Fair enough. Once again, album, the Talons of Wang Chiang. A Doctor who classic. And there's something for. For The XFM listener. 8 mile on DVD. I thought that was nice, that film. That was. The last bit was funny. It was. Because it's a good film. Some good rap pops in that as well. Ye. So let's play a tune and then we'll come back with the Rockbusters clues. Rm. Go on, give it to him. ReMax FM 104.9. Mickey German, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. I'll walk down Oxford street every day to go to the office. And it is like running the gauntlet. It's not only is it just like, you know, you have to dodge people and they're dawdling or rushing or, you know, keeping into the road to get passing people, but avoiding taxes. But it's like hands everywhere, like leaflets. I don't know. There must be a million leaflets given out. It's all mobile phones, sandwich shots. Teach yourself English. Teach other people English. I know. And. And those charity people. Something for Alzheimer's. And I. I've been caught about six times where I couldn't say no. I've got about eight standing orders now because I just couldn't say no. When they confront you, which is, you. Know, it's amazing how often I'm on the way to a meeting. I'm always on the way to a meeting. And then I always feel guilty if I walk past them again two minutes later with a HMV bag. Yeah. Yes, full. Yeah, exactly. Crammed with bargains. I know. Yeah. No, it's absolutely. They're like zombies. It's like you're just fighting them off. You need a flaming torch or if it's not them, it's tourists just constantly, you know, excuse me, can you take my photo outside HMV or outside Topshop? That doesn't happen to me. Always seem to have tourists just in the way, just kind of dawdling, you. Know, looking up at the building fast. I walk so hard with my head down and I just try and walk so fast everywhere now, because it's. Yeah, but Oxford street is just. It's unbelievable now. And I. I think it's age that I've started noticing. Even if the windows open, I hear just like, cars and they're on the mobile phone. It's the loudest place in the world. I don't know what we can do. Isn't it one of the busiest streets in. Is it either the world, the universe. It is mental. I think if we carpeted it, that would have to put some curtains up. It would just deaden. It's like pubs with those polished floors and metal tables and everyone's having to talk like that to be heard. The jukebox is quite loud and I want to go, just turn everything down, let's put some carpet down. Just talk quietly like this. Put the music down a little bit, we'll have a good time. I've never quite understood that impulse. I don't. Again, if it's age, where you go in a club or a pub, as you say, and the music's just slightly too loud, so it just makes everything slightly tricky. Slightly tricky to have a conversation. But what annoys me is, is when it's for the amusement of the barman or barmaid, they're bored, they're in a pub, they've got the music up. Their music up. Yeah, right. TECHNO BLARING Right, They've got a telly on, watching a soap opera. Yeah. And I want to go choose one or the other. I mean, what are you watching? I got a mini cab last night. I imagine you don't travel in minicabs, but the guy driving one of those guys, he's. I know. He's driving a cab on a Friday night, okay? No one wants to be doing that. And he had one of those phones, you know, the little earpieces that you put in so it looks like they're talking to themselves. And he's there and he goes, where you going? I went, oh, crouching. Well, I said, he's chatting on his mobile phone the whole time. His voice was so loud. He had the radio on as well and he wasn't concentrating on the road. I just felt I'm paying you £10 here to take me somewhere. Please just stop chatting or arranging your social life for two minutes. Yeah? Get me to my destination safely and then you can. You can resume your conversation. My favorite one is, I'm going to so and so Terrace, please. Where's that? I want to go. Right, you know you're not taking me, then. Yeah, I mean, I. I don't know. I don't drive that. I'm paying you. That's fine. Paying you, that's got to be part of the service. But, I mean, I know people have been in many cabs, didn't know where I was and didn't have an ace's head. No, I got. I came. I was in East London once. I said to him, I'm going to. Going to North London. He went, where specifically? I went Swiss Cottage. He went, sure, sure. I said, you know the way? He went, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Set off along the way. He went, do you know the way? I said, well, I thought you knew. I said, have you not got anywhere? No, it was one of those guys who'd just taken his car out, middle of the night. All he had, all his credentials were he had a car, no map, no torch, the two other things I bring with me. And he said, so we're driving along. He went, he went, I could probably get you to Camden. I was like, okay. He went to start. I mean, that is the start. Exactly. He went, do you know the way to Camden? I thought, pull over, it's not worth it. I'd rather hitchhike. I'd rather walk. Those people who just go out, yeah. They just can take a car out. Oh, have you ever done that? No. Well, I, you know, I'm sick of living there. And you send out people asking, you do. When you say here, you mean the world, don't you? No, just, just. Just in London is doing me adding now, the other. The other week, actually walking home from here. And like you say, there's always someone asking you, saying, you want to buy this? Do you want one of these? Going down Carnaby street, right, there's your first mistake. He said into meditation. So I was like, oh, I had a bit of time to kill, so I thought, I'll have a chat. Right. Have you got to? Oh, we've never got time. We're too busy. Yeah, I thought you were too busy before. What's all that then? What do you do? And he said, we'll teach you how to breathe. Well, I'm 30. Yeah, I've done All right. And he sort of said, I'll forget it. I'm 30. I mean, in. In Selfridges they do like, Evian or whatever, that water company there. And. And they've got like little glasses of water and you walk past and go, have you ever tried this? It's water. Yeah. Oh, here you go, we'll try it. You go, jesus, is that what water is? What have I been drinking, then? You've been drinking piss and mud. Have I? I'll have a bottle. Anyway, listen, Rockbusters. Oh, come on, then, let's get it done. Really? Yeah, Come on in. Right, so cryptic clues and initials. You work it out. It's a band and stuff. Yeah. Right, first one, Bob Holness. The first clue, the doctor said part of the foot and the leg was no good, so he took him off and he threw him away. That's the clue, the initials tb. Tkb. Right. The doctor said part of the foot and the leg was no good, so he took them off and threw them away. Second one. The Scottish monster has got a bit of a tan. Right. The Scottish monster has got a bit of a tan. Okay, that's. That's TD. Right, and the last one. Well, the. The 60s singer had a heart attack whilst he was having it away. We won't be seeing him again. Right, and that's F N M. F N m. Well, the 60 singers had a heart attack. He was having it away. We won't be seeing him again. Email in, Ricky. Dr. Vase. Remember, this is to save Rockbusters. If people don't get this right, it's no more. So you better. If you want this feature to stay, you better get the clues. All right, Good work, Carl. We'll give those clues again after the next tune. What we playing? Love it, don't you? Love it. Good. It's a good, good stomping. Pop number one rock xfm. How can you see into my eyes? Jane's Addiction. Just because I think things are rocking up. They are indeed rocking up in the land this year, Steve. Yes, that's good news, I think. Everness since then, the Darkness, Rocktastic XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkerton of a Saturday. Can I just say that the shaving your arse feature from earlier, if you missed that, that was half past one. That was a discussion on shaving your arse. Yeah, it was great stuff. That seems to have caught the public imagination. We've had so many emails, we've had someone telling us exactly how to shave your ass. Yeah. So if you need that information, I can probably forward it to you. Well, I think this will be the year of rock and ass. But it's extraordinary how, you know, just a simple discussion like that that you would think perhaps was crass, crude. Mind you, our listeners do like Carl talking about monkeys. Sure. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. It's not like it's. It's going to be proud of. It's not like we changed the nation or freed a people or found a cure for summer. We. We hit them in there, you know, at their level with monkeys and asses. It's what our listeners love. Yeah. Monkeys and asses. Yeah. We should put that on the poster. And they go together because I. I joined the zoo last time. We went down and became friends of the zoo. Right. Oh, I thought you had to sit in a cage for a. That thing happened. I went straight for the chimps, of course. Right. And there's sort of like three sort of big sort of adult ones there and there's people with their kids. And I could see the people just putting their kids away as one of them went up and started putting his face up the other ones. Oh, sure. And it was sort of like, I just can't be bothered to explain this to my children. Just movement. Oh, come on, then. There's the lions. He's gonna have a look at the lions. Yeah. What are they doing? They're just sniffing each other's asses. Yeah. Yes. I remember when I used to go to the zoo, I always felt there were certain animals that weren't getting a look in really, that no one was particularly interested in. The tapia. Exactly. We were going straight to the snakes. We were interested in. Yeah. Birds. I don't remember being particularly interested in birds. Big cats, although it's a bit depressing. Great apes. Great apes, reptile. You're right. Reptiles. Yeah. Birds. Unless it's a big one that you think a dog apart. Yeah. You go, brilliant. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Owls are brilliant. Yeah. Owl's great. But. But I've always wanted a little owl on my desk. I'd like to be doing work and there'd be a little owl there. And I go, can you get that pencil? And it just sort of goes over. Gets me pencil goes, cheers. And it just watches me and it thinks I'm brilliant. Do you know what I mean? Not really, no. No. No. I've never had notice to have any kind of animal sat on my desk. No, Carl, you'd like a little owl, wouldn't you? That helped you? No, I had a little magpie, you know, we've talked about that. Oh, he came down and start pecking. You grifted and he. Yeah. What was his name? Maggie. Sure. And it. You took it to school and it didn't come back once. Here again. Oh, dear. Did it ever pick your head because you used to have hair, didn't you? Yeah, no, I did. It started getting a bit violent. Really? Yeah. Was it becoming sort of a rage where. Unless it's probably sexual frustration, sort. You know, because it. Because I think magpies go for shiny objects, don't they? You're probably sort of. Yeah. Probably losing it a little bit then in the front and so when the sun was out, there's a bit of. A sheen on the front. They saw glare and thought, I'll have that. What is that? That's brilliant. Yeah. Or as it was sort of pecking away, it mistook it for a tree. Yeah. Because the noise. Yeah. The hollow sound. I squeezed his head yesterday. We should just point out, if you're a new listener to xm, you might not realize that one of Ricky's many sexual peccadillos. I'm assuming it's a sexual thing. I can't justify it any other way. Is to just squeeze Carl's head. Yeah. Front, sidewise. I don't know what it is. I don't know if it's sexual. You know, like when you've got a little kitten, you can't. You. Oh, you want to squeeze his little face. Do you know what I mean? Do you know what I mean by that, Carl? Yeah, yeah. Squeeze a little head. Yeah, exactly. And I feel that with you, because it's sort of like it gives so much. Look at Carl's face. He gives so much. Like he. It is like he can understand what we're saying. Yeah. And that's what the connection is, I think, between me and Carl and other animals. It's like you can understand what we're saying. But I squeezed it yesterday and Carl went. I definitely had something crack because I'm trying to see how hard I can squeeze it. Yeah. I think that was you just thinking, Carl, to be fair, I think the cogs just started to. No, I mean, I think there is a danger. Because I think there is a danger that you could. You could squeeze it too much. Yeah, I know. He did a good deed today. The other day, didn't. Yeah. Was it? Yeah. What were you up to? You were just. You were talking about, like, you know, being in the street and stuff. And I get hassled a lot by the homeless. Don't we all? Don't we all? She got home to sleep. I'm here, mate. But no, I. I do treat him a lot. I love that. You had a good day? Yeah. You've been good? Yeah. There you go. Suzanne does the Save the Children thing. You were talking about, you know, charities, asking you all the time. She does that. And I sort of say, well, you do that. I'll. I'll look after. You'll take care of the homeless. I'll take care of the odd tramp around where I live. And how do you treat them? Different ways. 50p I might give them. Yeah. Or am I, you know, they'll sort of say, have you got any money? I'll say, what for? And they'll go, I'm really thirsty, so I'll go, hang on a minute. And I nip and get on a little Diet Coke. They want to watch their weight. Yeah, yeah. They're going full fat. Oh, what an insult to a man like me. Yeah, yeah. I'd rather treat them than. Because a lot of people spend. Spend money on, you know, problems abroad and stuff. Right. I just think, you know. Yeah. I'm just saying. Oh, God. Like what? What do you mean? Like famine relief. Well, you do get sick of it, don't you know? I mean, it's not. You get sick of it. I'm just. I know. Just let. Let whatever you do. Now, Steve, don't interrupt because I'm scared, but I just think it's. It's worth it. There's so many issues. There's freedom of speech, there's. We're not responsible, there's. He'll get away with it because he's a buffoon. Yes. And it is entertaining. Exactly. So all I'm saying is. You're saying, you know, do I. Who do I give me money to? Is it. Is it, you know, little, you know, sick kids or whatever? Or is it old people or whatever? Hmv. They get a lot of it. Yeah. Yeah. And for me, I just get sick of, you know, problems abroad. It's like, what do you do? What do you do with famine and that, what you meant to do. How can you solve it? It's gone for years. Yeah. It just keeps going. We keep giving them money to keep spending it and there's no. You're not getting any return for your cash. Well, it's just how many times. You know, they've got to learn. Do you mean they've got to learn what, are you gonna teach them a lesson? What do you mean? They've got to learn. What do you mean? Well, what are they doing with it? They must have, like, better interest accounts or something where, you know, look after. Get. Put the money in the right things. Sorry, do you think that Bob Galdoff sort of writes him a check? He goes over and he's in the helicopter and there's. There's millions of them. And they go, it's Galdoff from Boomtown Rats. There's one man that can help us. Yeah, I hope he doesn't sing. He's not gonna sing. He's got some money for us. And he comes down and he goes, they are. Do you want to ch. Do you take switch? They go, we don't take switch. He goes, there's a check. They. They get things like again, though. Isn't he as well? I mean, I like. You know, he used to work here, Bob. He's a lovely fellow and that. Yeah, he's a lovely man. But how many times can you save the world? You know, he's. He's over there again helping out and it's like, well, you know, what do you do? Are you saying don't bother because it keeps happening? Not for hell? I'm not saying that. You know what I mean. I'm not daft. But that's what you're thinking. And, Carl, you are daft. Yeah, exactly. I just. I don't know what the answer is. Do you know what I mean? So you're just saying wash your hands of the whole affair, leave them to it. Yeah, sure. Are you really just saying it's sort of. It's nature. It's tough luck. Just don't interfere like a wildlife program. Is that what you're saying? Don't interfere? Basically you're saying, it's not my concern. This has got a bit heavy. Can we do Cheeky freak of the week? Oh, God. My, my. Hey, hey. Out of the Blue from the album Russ Never Sleeps by Neil Young. Such a brilliant song. Oh, he's a great, great musician. He's amazing. Yeah, he's incredible. I think we're playing Neil Young track a week, okay. From now until Christmas. Brilliant. Okay. All right. Excellent. On XFM 104.9, I'm looking around with Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. We were talking about the. I saw homeless guy in the Week as I was walking down Finchley Road and he was peering in the window of one of the Dixons or something like that. Just checking out the details. On one of those cable TV packages. And I thought, one step at a time. I mean, if you firstly, I don't know, start eating your dinner off a plate. Yeah. And then work your way up to, you know, a house, a home, a widescreen tv, digital television, but it's old. Well, that might answer one of the questions, because I keep getting recognized by homeless people and I never know what to say. Oh, is your. I think either they, they're not really homeless and they've, you know, they. I don't know, they've got sort of digs or something and they watch television, or the scariest one is that they, They've become homeless in the last few months. Sure. Since the office. And I think, oh, God, that's really scary. Or they are watching it in Dixon's. They're going, the office is on tonight. Yeah, yeah. What are you doing? Yeah, Going on to Dixon's. Or they think you're one of them or that. Well, I am. The way you dress. Well, no, some that are probably. They're not quite. Yeah. Got their faculties that maybe a bit worse for wear. Think they recognize me and they're, they whole scenarios where they're going, Remember we were chatting, I was going, yeah, yeah. How are you? How are you? And it's just. They recognize someone. Right? Yeah, but that's, that's a bit weird. But I mean, I think that's the worst thing. Homeless. I, I. On a serious note, it is outside health. We're talking about charity. And I don't know, I sort of got this standard as well. I've been sort of caught in the street. But the ones that I choose, I'd always think charity is what touches you. You can't change the world, but you can change your bit. So cancer, obviously, because my mum. So I give to cancer. And I think outside health, the next one must be being homeless, because there's nothing you can do. It's got everything. You're scared cold. It's just everything. Even if you're healthy and homeless, eventually you're not gonna be. Well, I just, I do feel bad because, you know, I always feel that I want to give to the health charities, like cancer, for instance, because there's that fear that I might get it. Yeah. It's not just that. It's just like. Yeah, if you're. That's the first thing, isn't it? If, if you'd, like, if your life's being threatened, there's nothing else you can really worry about. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know. If that makes it wrong, though, that I'm sort of. It's like I'm investing in a possible future. Yeah, well, not really, because it's the same for everyone, isn't it? But, you know. I saw a homeless guy as well, looking through the bins, but he wasn't pulling out food and scraps, he was pulling out newspapers, just having a read. Yeah, I always found that odd. I see that a lot, homeless guys. I don't know if they're just checking out the TV listings when he finally gets his. Yeah, yeah, the office, they've moved it. They've moved it to Choice and UK Gold. I don't. I mean, I don't blame him because, I mean, there is some cracking stuff on cable tv, some great stuff I was flipping through the other day and on digital TV you can see what other shows are on while you're watching something. I was sleeping through and there was one and it was called now when are you ever in the mood to watch a TV show called I Survived a 200 Pound Tumor? When was that on? Because it seems to me that if you've got a 200 pound tumour, you probably want to watch something else. They'll take your mind off it, Big brother. Whatever. I'm not 200 pounds. Well, I can't imagine what this is. A 200 pound tumor. It must have been an error. 200 pound tumor. It must have Been a 200 pound tuna. It was probably. Someone fell in the water and it came. I survived a 200 pound tuna. Yeah. And it was just a spelling mistake. Sure. A 200 pound tumor. That's like. Isn't that like kind of having. That's not. That is another maybe. Oh, my God. Maybe it was a. All his life they told me it was a Siamese twin, but someone had just painted a little face on it when he was at school. Just drawn a little face. Exactly. Yeah. And I go, it's not your twin brother. I go, isn't it? There's no, it's a tumor. We better take it off. It's £200. £200? That can't be right. You sure it wasn't £20? I'm assuming that's what it would have. Probably would have been, but it was certainly £200 on the digital thing. Maybe that's a mistake. That's great, isn't it? They're trying to make it more interesting. Yes. I'm not Carl. Right there. 20 pound tumor. Let's make it 200. At least they're watched that's what I'd be like, though. I wouldn't. I wouldn't want to go to the doctors. You know what I'm like 200 pound tumor. I know. It's just that, that thing. I mean, you know what I'm like. I don't like. It depends where it is as well. Taking your clothes off and all that. There's some pressure in it. You don't like anything being touched here. He doesn't check his balls. He doesn't like the feel. That's. That's. Live with me. He doesn't like the feel, I think. Do you mean that you don't like what it feels like in your balls when you're fiddling with them? Because I imagined it that you meant you don't like the feel. I. In your fingertips. You don't like the feel of your balls. It's. It's the thing of. You start thinking about what you're actually touching and there's something in there and you might break them and all that. I don't like. They are delicate. I am scared with a little knobbly bit bits. Yeah. What nobly bits? Well, I'll tell you what, it's not the. At the doctors, it's that thing of he's not taking your clothes off in front of him. Like, it's the way you've got to take your clothes off. But he has you to go behind that curtain to do it first, so there's more pressure because then you come walking out with nothing on. Why do you ask me to go behind there? Yeah. Rather than if they just sat there having a chat and he's going, so, yeah, how have you been? It's like, all right. And just checking the pants. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Don't take your clothes off. And you came out and he'd lit a candle and there was some soft music on. Nice. Or he said, if you'll make you feel more relaxed, I'll take my clothes off. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. But I'll do it in the form of a striptease. Now. Now, Carl, I'm gonna ask you the question, knowing the answer. What do you think of maybe a gay doctor just checking the testicles out? He's a professional. He just happens to be gay. That would never happen, would it? What are you talking about? Why not? Oh, speaking of. Go on. Doctors. No. Gay people or not. Do you know when we discussed gay only toilets? Yeah. It's only. It looks like it's coming into action. No, it doesn't. Right. No way. It was mentioned again Where? On your head? No, I think. Do you think that people in positions of power are listening to this show, getting ideas from you, Tony Bear. Makes you wonder, doesn't it? No, it really does. And the funny thing is why are they getting upset? Why gay people getting upset that they might have to have their own toilets? Carl, you don't know what you're talking about anymore. You don't know what you're talking about. Okay, can we have Cheeky Freak after this. Placebo, this picture on XFM 104.9. Steve, you're thinking of taking over as producer, aren't you? Well, I just think it's a shambles. I've asked for Cheeky Freak of the Week and it appears that Carl's not ready. He's not prepared. No, I can sort of remember it. It's just I like to have a. Contempt for the listener. He's just had about. Just a whole bunch of adverts and placebo chatting. We're having a ch. Right. Do you want to sort yourself out in future? Yeah, someone. That's what we were chatting about. Someone emailed in about they watched the 200 pound tumor thing and when it was removed it was carried away in the wheelbarrow. Right. Carl said, well, even when she had it removed she still carried it round in the wheelbarrow. And he went, I thought it sort of like she's got become attached to it. I mean you are, you definitely are my favorite thing in the world. It's great. Look at the way he's looking back. I think they're all the same, the people. I mean, I have had more emails about people saying I watched the 200. Pound tumor and I gave me arse than anything else. When we ask questions, we come up. With sideshow, we talk. Yeah, yeah. Nothing, nothing concept to talk about political issues. One person emailed in, they said, I tuned into the 200 pound tumour documentary. It looked disgusting. I couldn't watch for long. What were you expecting? Yeah, that it might sing and dance, do a little show for you. Oh, what's this? These are really your listeners, Kyle. Now I think we've. You know what I mean, you sort of. You find your niche, you attract your. I think me and Steve are pretty much just here. I think the people that we had in the early days, Rick, they've long since abandoned us. They jump. They've got jobs. Yeah, they've got jobs. They're out now. They've been released. Exactly. Getting their life back together. Situation with Cheeky Freak. I've Got like a couple of bits. Like I said, I haven't got the in depth stuff that. I know, I know. Because usually it's, you know, it's pretty scientifically. Exactly. Yeah, yeah, do the jingle. We've got. We. We've come up with a new one, haven't we? Le Freak. Say chic cheeky freak of the week. Right, well, couple of. Couple of bits. I don't know which one to use as the main feature for this week. That good, is it? Well, there's been another one. Born little kid. You won. Four eyes. Insult. Just a guy who wears glasses. Come on, four hours. Four eyes, two noses, two mouths. That's weird. This bloke, did he also have two heads, two bodies, sort of born sort of slightly separately? He wasn't stood next to a mirror. No, no. It's weird. Not in it. That's all you've got. I love that. That's weird. And it was. A doctor said that. Well, Mrs. Parks, kids got four eyes and two noses. Weird, isn't it? Any clues? Any clues? So that's. That's. That's it. That's all the information. That should be the main one. Okay, like, I say this. What's the idea of this feature? What do I say all the time? Don't know. I always say, think about it. Think about what that would be like. Okay, what giving birth to him being. I think it's a girl being like her two mouths, four eyes. What would that be like? Mad, innit? I don't know. I don't know what this feature is. Is there another one? Is that you said? I mean, I hope everyone took the opportunity there during that silence to just think about what it would be like. I know I was. Could she talk with her mouthful? What, is that allowed? Because she's got two maes. Yeah. Would that be all right in her house? She'd be eating. Yeah. She could talk with one mouth and eat with the other. Listen, the main one, right, you've thought about that, that's good. The main cheeky freak of the week. I've got all the details. Smallest person ever. Right, well, how big would you say that is? Carl is now sort of like holding his hands up like a fisherman a long ways. That's about one foot, right? Smallest, smallest man in the world. I printed the thing off and I can't find it. There's a little picture of him, right. The odd thing was. But why have you asked me how did it say or was it a picture of him? I didn't really read It. Of course you didn't. Jesus. I just saw it and thought, oh, that's right. I assumed it was natural size. That was that big. But what do you mean it was. That big little fella. But why are you doing that? What? What? It was a page with a little fella. How do you know that was natural size? No, it was because it said, it's world's smallest man. And the funny thing is, I remember, I've read the first line. I always read the first line, it said, well done. Well done. The weird thing is, he's got an head like a light bulb. The shape of it, apparently. I don't know if that's got anything to do with this shape. Oh, God, that big. His name's Mr. Watts. And the. The annoying thing is, what got me is if you're that big. Yeah, right. Don't have your picture taken next to a fruit bowl. Why was he having his photo taken as for football? Don't know. Whoever the photographer was obviously having a bit of a laugh. Yeah, at his expense. Because you would just stand in the middle of nowhere, you'd look normal and that way he was stood there just leaning on an apple. Leaning on an apple. What is this? In what world? This. This was. This was on. On the Internet. Was it dumb fun? What is this? Are you sure it wasn't that some sort of sci fi show they're advertising? No, no, it was. It was a bleeding on it. Can you. Sorry, can you just lean on the apple? Just lean on the apple, man. Do me a favor. You stand next to my Chihuahua. You're not taking the piss, are you? No, not at all. No. Could you. Would you mind leaning on this matchbox? Yeah. Leaning on an apple. And that's what. So he just said, there's the world's smallest man leaning on an apple. Smallest man said about his head being like a light bulb. I don't know what that meant. And I just thought, right, that. That'll do. That's that sort of cheeky rig of the week done. I think that was on like Monday. Right. I've found that. I thought that's done. Printed it off, forgot to get it off the photocopier. Someone's nicked it. Play a record that you got to. You know, it's just. Steve. No, can I just say. No, Carl, please. If I say, let's have cheeky freak of the week and you haven't done your research, you haven't got the information, just tell us you can't do it, but don't lead us on. Don't say this radio. Hold your hand up to me and go, how tall is that? It's nothing. It's nothing. I think it was that because he was leaning on an apple. It's not enough information. Imagine Trevor McDonald coming on, going, some news, some stuff. How big's that? How big do you think that is? Yeah, because there was a fella. Yeah. Coming up after Chris. More Chris Tarrant play record. I just. I'm angry. I'm actually angry. And if monkey news is anyway in any way similar, you've really pulled your finger up with that, have you? Good. Let's have Rockbusters answers next. Supersonic Oasis on XFM. 104.9. Right. Getting through it. It's the Rockbusters. The rock was results, really. Because this is. And a very important result is whether they stay in the Premiership or are relegated. This is the playoffs for Carl. Okay, you need three points. You need three points to stay up. Carl. Go on. Right, the had a lot of right answers on that. Okay, That's. That's. That's in your favor, you know. Okay. The first clue was the doctor said part of the foot and the leg was no good, so he took them off. He threw him away. Yeah, the initials tb. Yeah. Right. Gone. Toe, knee. Bennett. All right, That's Tony Bennett. Tony Bennett. Tony Bennett. Yeah. Okay, that's a warning. That's a yellow card. That is a yellow card. But if you can still get the points because his name's not been it. Tony. Brilliant. Tony. Perfect. A pun. Toe, knee. His name's Tony. Perfect. Bennett. No, his name's Bennett, see? Well, he's in London this week as well, so I don't know if it's sold out. I won't mind. Are you on drugs or have you. Did I actually crack your head? Did I actually give you some brain damage? Because you're worse than usual now. It's like, go on. All right, the second one. That's Scottish fella. We've got to speed this show up. I've just got to make sure it's right. We don't want to look stupid. That Scottish monster has got a bit of a tan. I don't think we can look stupid with material like this. Td. That Scottish monster's got a bit of a tan. The answer there, the Darkness. I'll give you that. Right, well done. And the last one. Goal. Goal. The 60s singer, he had arts out the other way whilst having it away. You won't be seeing him again. The initials F.N.M. that's faith no more. Adam Faith. Right. No. Doesn't count. Why not? Adam Faith no more. Adam Faith no more. So sorry, what is the clue? Is the clue Adam faith or is it faith no more? Just faith, I suppose. Just faith no more. So we got that. That's that safe for next week. What? Who's the winner? What'd you make of it? You've got the deciding vote. Rick. Come on. I mean, you know my. I mean it worked. It works. Faithful but he's mixed up. What cryptic. Isn't that because it start. Because the. The fella. I mean Adam Faith did actually die having it away, didn't he? Yeah. So it's all about him. It's all right. All the facts are right. Anyway. Okay. I think he's got a reprieve. I think I'll give it to him. I think I've got to give it to him, Steve. I think I have. He actually pulled it out of the bag, that one. There's no, there's no Jamaican fellas seeing icebergs or you know, Whitney Houston. The closest he came to is Bennett Bennett and I got. I'll give him. Let him off that. I've got to be a fair ref here. Well, fair enough and well done to. You know, I'm always a fan of names that for some reason just. Just strike me or tickle me. Yeah. And this week the lucky winner is Dave Suckling. I. There's nothing, there's nothing amusing about that. Oh dear to one on to Dave Suckling. Okay, well, Suckling wins it. Suckling takes the prize. He takes the prizes. And well done to him. I guess there's more of that next week and we're fast approaching the end of the show. Rick, I know you are excited about that as I might. I know. But the best to come because we've still got Bruce Springsteen coming up now followed by Monkey News. It's amazing. What an amazing show this is. Oh, chimpanzee that. Monkey News. Excellent. So monkey News time on xfm. Carl Pilkington, the man in the hot seat. Carl, what have you got for us? Okay, Monkey News this week we've covered a lot of stuff. We have indeed. Now do you know, like there's places where you can go for like weekend rests and stuff and you, can you relax, you sit in a little spa, you might have a swim and stuff. Well, they've got a place done for monkeys. Of course they are right. They can go there, they can relax. Forget about all the stuff they've got going on Their head. They can have a manicure, right? It's got nice meals. It's not called a manicure though, it's called a chimpa cure. Beauty treatments. Yeah, right. It look good and stuff. Yeah, well, look good, feel good, yeah. Now you might think, well, that's pretty normal. Well, the bit I haven't told you about is it's actually run by a couple of chimps. Oh. Oh, God. Oh God. Oh God, you're a maniac. Oh, for Christ. Let's just. Because it's not. No, no, no, it is because think about it. No, not think about it. What do you mean? Yes, it is. Of course it's not run by a couple of chimps. What'd they do, get alone? Right. If a chimp, once I've arrest. Yeah. Where would you go? To a place that's run by humans that don't. What don't. They don't know what chimps needs are. No, my point is this. How did they get it together? How did the two. Two chimps, what? Mr. And Mrs. Chimp went for a loan, said, I'll tell you what, we need a spa. I think it started off quite simple, right? Just, just, you know, basic, basic stuff. But they've expanded over time because it's become so popular. It's gone mental down there. Sure. Now, the thing is, the problem is this, right? That isn't even the. The top and bottom of it, right? Christ. The problem is it's been going on and on and on, right? It's been. It's been earning a lot of money and stuff. The monkeys are happy, the monkeys that go there are loving it. They're telling friends and stuff. They're all coming to it. Now the problem is it's this little, little monkey, little man monkey and a little woman monkey, right? Yeah, it was sort of girlfriend and boyfriend, sort of. Well, it's an open relationship. They can play around if they want. Well, the problem is they're not married. Right now, trouble brewing. The lad, Monkey fella. Monkey, he's getting quite old. And the problem is because it's his name that's down on all the forms. Let him finish, I'm getting scared now. Let him finish. It's his name on the business. And the problem is his. His Mrs. Is kind of like what's gonna happen. Sure. What are you getting this? Where are you getting this from? Internet. Oh, I don't know where to start. Now this is the. Can we just hear the end? This is ridiculous. So the problem is the, the female. Monkey is worried that the male monkey. What's gonna happen with the business? What's going to happen? Of course. Right now. What do you mean, the business? The. The. The. That is the business. It's a joke, Rick. You're not listening. His name's on the forum. The mailmaking name. It's in his name. Now. The problem is the woman monkey has got some kids, but because they're not blood relatives, it's not going to be handed down to them and the court. They're kids from a previous monkey marriage. Yeah, Right. So that they're not going to get it. And just check this out. Yeah. Otherwise you don't check the facts, otherwise you could look like a twat spouting on the radio. Please check the facts for scientific security. They're just a bit worried because they're saying that the people in Ohio, which is where they. Where they've got the. The. The little health thing going on. So that makes it more believable that it's Ohio. I thought you meant it was Berkshire. In which case it would be rubbish. It looks like the local people are trying to get in there. They've seen the success of it. Sure. And then I could go in and take it over and stuff. Yeah. So give me the piece of paper. Throw it away, play a record. That's the worst. That's the worst one I've ever heard. And you are. There's something wrong with you. You're educationally subnormal. Final tune from us, Tim Buckley. Lovely song called Wings. Back next week. Yep. Yep. See you, Carl. Although you've spoken many times before.",
