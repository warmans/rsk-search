Now let's say his name. Carl Pilkington. Okay, I was just getting a little bit annoying because they're writing up now in Heat. I know they're saying it's sort of. Like it's the Carl Pilkington show with Ricky and Steve. So let's, you know. Has he won multiple awards? Yeah, exactly. No. Is he one of the hottest comedy faces on tv? I don't, I don't think so. No, no. Does he too much cheese. Exactly. Get a bit sick, is he? Bloated old fat, 40 year eyes, stupid fat face, Goggle eyed away. Oh, you'll be happy. Go on. The WOR made a bit of a comeback. Don't give me. No, listen, right there's a. There's a sign to his advertisement and they sing a song. It's the Worzel singing a song about something. A phone in. What's the number, Carl? Oh, 8, 700800 1234. Phone in if you know what I'm talking about. Just in general, that's a new competition. Can we just repeat that number every 30 seconds? And people could just explain what the last link would have been. Phone in if you know what we're talking about. Yeah, yeah. Phone in if you care what we're talking about. What's the words of story? What's to get what? No, I just, I just thought of you because they. And it's a song that. It's a modern song I think they've done and I can't remember what the song is but maybe what you mean it's. It's them doing a modern. It's just an advert. It's just an advert. I think it's the Wurzels. I thought of something as well. You know I drove my tractor past your A stack last night. I'm not that familiar. Surprising what sort of person lives in a haystack. Maybe they don't live in it. Maybe it's just saying your. That's your haystack. Yeah, they're probably a farm owner. But the problem with the world is it's like, you know, if you come from the west country you're just constantly cursed by this. Oh, you must love the world. So do you like the words? Ooh, and it's like, you know, why. Do you do Your hair and your sideburns. Like them if you don't like them. Well, you know, smocks are very comfortable, Rick, but, you know, I don't want to be kind of, you know, I mean, there's lots of famous things that come from Bristol, obviously. You know, Tricky and Massive Attack and Porter's Head from the area. Porter's Head. No one seems to flag them up every time they want to slag off the West Country. Do you still make your own clogs? Because you do. That's fantastic. Cheap. You used to knit your trousers, didn't you, when you go, is it. Why? Why was that? Because it's just like cheap material. Straw is cheap down there. Well, we got a great show lined up for you. Have we? Yeah, I was bluffing. I don't know. You know, we sometimes worry about the record library here at XFM because we tend to go in and try and find something. You know, it'd be like an old. Carl sign, because he gets. He gets stick Monday morning. It's very hard to find anything after, he said, I think most of it's been nicked by people like Sturgis and otherwise. It's just bad. I don't know who it is that's. Buying Blonde's big single. Exactly. Oh, something like that. Excellent. Tonight, Matthew, I'm going to be four Non Blondes. Wow. Good effort. Yeah. I don't think you'll be returning to the fish factory on Monday, will you, Steve? No. Yeah, you will. You will. Go on. But they. Anyway, so we got four Non Blondes. We found a lot of in excess out there on the XFM record library. Guess what I found today. Go on. The Very Best of Tony Basil. That's one track there. Well, yeah, her hit was Mickey, obviously. Oh, Mickey, you're so fine. Yeah, They've managed to pack out 18 there. 18 tracks, first tracks, Mickey, number of other tracks. Track number 17, Mickey, Spanish version. Right. Track 18, Mickey, 12 inch version. And track 19, Dicky. Yeah, similar tune, but about a completely different person. Al. They've stuck a proud property of XFM sticker on that. The Best of Tony Basel. Even Sturgis wouldn't nick that. Come on, Carl, what's the story? It was good in its day, wasn't it? Why is it in the XFM library? Adam and the Ants in the day it was important money. I remember that. Being out in the Chance. It was all right. Music's meant to be fun. Let's play Mickey. Let's play some Strokes then. Let's play Mickey then If you're so happy about this car, should we play Mickey later? Yeah, the Spanish version. What about that? We've called you bluff, all right? Oh, yeah. Phone in if you know what he just said. The Strokes. And last night we just had a call, didn't we, from Johnny Mango. Oh, yeah, Johnny Mango. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, the Mangster. And he informed me that one of the worst was his dead. And I didn't know that. Yeah. AJ Cutler, who was the lead man, I think. Yeah. He said he died the most rock and roll death you can die. He said he was apparently driving on a. On a terrible cocktail of cider and other things, presumably. Yeah, Apples and jams. And he crashed into a tractor. Now, one. Is that true? I, I, I. JM's not winding me up. I hope the Mango boy's not having a laugh at me. Is that true? One of the words was, died by tractor, did he? Is that true? So give us a call. What's the number again, Carl? Oh, 870-800-1234. If so, I'm sorry that I disrespected them. I didn't, I didn't know. Could you imagine? Oh, God. If, right, say if, like, you're the driver of the tractor and you. You kill someone. You go, oh, God, I've killed someone. And then you look and it's someone famous. Yeah. Or AJ Cutler. Yeah, go on, what was your point? No, it's just like. It's like you've killed someone and you look. Yeah, I know what you mean. Actually, what makes it even. What makes it even worse, they were rich. Yeah. Oh, say if it was someone who's, like, really big in the world. Now that is a good. I quite like that. It's an interesting point, though. That's your bag. No wonder I can't find what I'm looking for. All right, well, as Bono said. Did you bring a bag? Yeah, sorry. Is that under there? Rick? Sorry. Sorry about this. I'm not, I'm not. This is getting a bit sloppy, you know. It's not. No, no, no, it is, Rick. It's getting sloppy. It's never got stuff before. No, I've got a list here because we went to this award ceremony in the week we were up for an award. Well, let me. I have to explain it to Carl, because basically we were up for an award and it's called the, it's the Trick Awards. Now, Trick stands for Television and Radio Industries Club Annual Awards. Right. We've never heard of it either. We never heard of it. It's some kind of like television, radio, industry club. Yeah, that's the clue. So. But we don't want to. I'm not trying to slag off the award because it was, you know, it was. It was a big thing and they really made an effort and it was very nice. Food was brilliant. It was at the Grosvenor House Hotel. Really nice do. And, you know, lots of industry people in that there. It was really classy. We got there nice and early. So, you know, we were there for. A good four hours before we sit down and. But it was just kind of surreal. It was just a bit weird because it was packed with the cream. I'm literally the cream. Big names, you know, Martin Kemp, one of the first people I saw, you know, came in like, big tv, radio, industry names on screen, Talent, behind the scenes people. John Barnes. Barnes was there. Beadle was there. Sir Cliff Richard was there. Yeah, right. Anyway, so the voice comes on, says, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the chairman of President, the president of the Trick Awards. And we had to stand up, all of these people to stand up and give a standing ovation as he walked to his table to Tom O'Connor, former presenter of Crosswits. You are joking. No, he's the president. And he came out, he told a few gags, sort of like, it was like, straight away, it was, you know, old school stuff, you know, I was like, thank the ladies, because, you know, it was nothing without the ladies. All the lovely ladies here. And we went for a joke. No, just that, just thanking the ladies. Well, you're forgetting that just prior to that, he. He said grace. Oh, he said grace before we ate. It's me. It was me, Steve and Ash, you know, our producer, the little disabled fella. All right? And he's. He's there in his wheelchair and there's me and Steve, you know, we're standing up during the. Grace. Just stop you there. Go on. Saw someone in the week and. Sorry, did we bore you? You just reminded me then about the little producer who's in a wheelchair. Yeah. Last week you said, blah, blah. And our producer who's in a wheelchair got a text from someone saying, what's happened to you? They thought you were talking about me. Oh, really? So, yeah. Oh, you're handicapped in a different way. So go on. And Tom O'Connor, he said, thank you, God for. We thought this was a joke initially. We thought he was gonna be like a kind of cheeky gag. That's why. That's why we were laughing at that. That's why we were laughing raucously. Anyway. And then he went, I thought you were for this and. And help those who walk alone. And Ash went, what about those that don't walk at all? He said, I've never been. I've never been left out of grace before, so. But we had to. And we had to kind of like bowed our heads slightly, you know, and did we say our men? I know that we were sort of. A lot of people did. I'm pretty sure Cliff, I think probably chimed in there. Yeah. And sang it. Yeah, exactly. So like Mariah Carey. So anyway, so. But before, again, you see, what Ricky's forgotten is before Tom took to the stage, this guy walks up there, I don't know who he is, says, there's a lot of people here this city this afternoon. You know, it's wonderful event. But of course there's a load of celebrities as well. He said, thank you for all the celebrities that have turned up. And then he went, Table 77, Mr. Russ Abbott. We all. Round of applause. Can we have the spotlight there? Russ Abbott, by the way, smoking a pipe. Absolutely. He looked like a bit like Barrett Holmes, this hilarious Sherlock Holmes character. Then he went, Table 107, the cast of Bad Girls. Clap. We'll have to clap. And then he went, table five, Alice, beer. Clap. Slightly smaller clapping. Yeah, yeah. And it's just like. And I thought, when is this gonna. He went through every single celebrity in. The room and there were about, you know, a hundred. Table 53. John Inman, everyone. It's John Inman. Round of applause. Yeah, yeah. Table 70, Mr. Simon Cowell. Yeah. There was, there was booing there and. They all booed him. That was nice. Yeah, that was a joke. Ironic booing, I think. Could they cheer for Foxy? Was he on the table? Foxy wasn't there. He was doing his show. When they went up, they won an award. Cowell and Waterman and Chapman. Table 43, Peter Sissons, everyone. Peter Sissons went through every single name. Ricky got so paranoid they might mention him that we. We kind of legged it upstairs. And we're watching from the balconies. They shone the spotlight on our table. Empty. That was a tick one. But then at the end, Sir Cliff got up there, right? Cuz Sir Cliff was giving out the. The lifetime achievement award, right? He gets up, he speaks, he goes, oh, this is a personal friend of mine, a seven days a week friend. Lifetime achievement award goes to Mrs. Gloria Hunnaford, right? We immediately start thinking, what exactly were her lifetimes? I think living that long. That's pretty much it. I don't know what is she's done. I don't exactly. You know, I know she used to have a Radio 2 show. Anything. We're not dissing anyone, we're not taking the mick out of anyone. But. But anyway, it's just a strange. It was just a strange event. But Gloria got taken unawares by this and started to ad lib a speech, right. And I swear to God, about 12 minutes in she was telling us how. And I can repeat, I can tell you now, if you're interested, her lovely daughter Karen is currently in Australia. It's partly work, it's partly a holiday, Carl, and she's having a whale of a time, but she's not spoken to her for any. And then she went, she went. Actually she's been there for a long time. Yeah. And it's like I was. Thought she was going, she doesn't call, you do that. You get a Blue Peter. And this is. We thought she was going to get photos out, maybe start showing. Was a nice event. And you know everyone there. Henry Coop was there, so Henry Cooper. Because every single element as well was sponsored by someone. I was looking at the menu. I've got the program here and the menu, right, the pudding is sponsored by Electrolux. Yeah. I don't know if you've ever had a pudding sponsored by Electrolux. I was sponsored by Zanussi. When everyone was doing the prayers, did you. Did you look at them with their eyes shut like you did at school? What do you mean? Well, when you. Did you look at someone with your eyes shut? No, like you'd do that. You do your. Your hands together. Yeah. And you sort of look at people with their eyes shut and think that's what they look like when they're sleeping. Play record. Can you ever do that? Table 60, Lisa Tarbuck. That's a corner shop. Lessons Learned From Rocky one to Rock. I love that guitar. That's great. It's real glam Rocket. That's T Rex and Valley. I was gonna play somewhat from Siggy Stardust today, but instead I brought in a different album. I want to play a bit of Bowie. Is that all right? Oh, of course, yeah. Beatles still to come up, by the way. We with the education of Carl. Last week he did Che Guevara. He did very well before that. The week before that he learned all about Rasputin, didn't you? And this week you've been studying Hitler, haven't you? How would that go? How'd you reckon that It's a bit tough. Okay. I mean, I'll give you the full story later. Steve, do you know much about him? No. So they're all linked, all these stories I've been reading, they've all got a similar sort of thing going through them. They're born, they have a bit of a tough upbringing. Things aren't going well and they seem to take it out on, on other people. Okay, I'll tell you more later. Okay. Yeah, I don't think you can. I mean, I don't think Hitler and Che Guevara, it's the same thing. Che Guevara when he was a kid. Yeah. Adlight asthma. It wasn't an happy kid. Hitler, he, he only had one ball. Well, I was, I was trying to find about that. Yeah, Seriously. He phoned me up with a week. I said, how's it going? He went, I've skimmed it. I've just skimmed it. I was looking for the, the testicle thing. Now I don't know if they left that out or. It's not true. Right. So he was, he was trying to look up that Hitler has only got one ball. I think they only did it to wind him up because it's like, you know. Yeah, you might be taking over the world. We're all saying you've only got one testicle. Sure. And it's. Did you look in the index? And it's sort of Hitler Adolf, family life, early childhood. Testicles. Testicles, absence of sort of skim through. Because one of mother. Mother brackets, other. Yeah, yeah. Albert Hall. Yeah. The only thing I could find was at one point in, in like when he was trying to run the place, there was a meeting going on and somebody put a bag in the meeting room and it blew up. Yeah, it was under the table. Yeah, but it was, it was what? The testicle was under the table? No, the bag. The bag blew off the ball. No, the ball sack was probably hanging below the protective top and so that's where he could have lost. But why would he have only just lost the one? Because the way he was sitting cross legged or something. Sure, sure. Okay. Well, I mean. Again, again. I mean last week we had a Che Guevara expert phoned up. Maybe they could. Maybe there's a Hitler expert this time who could maybe find up and confirm the, the testicle theory. Yeah. What's the number again, Carl? Oh, 700-812-34. You need to have at least done a PhD or something. I don't think we should invite calls about Hitler. I think we're asking for trouble. No, I'm talking about someone who's done a study of him and he's done a PhD. Okay, I'm not talking about any old nutter. And also Carl's lottery numbers, he's a little bit more confident this week. Okay, good. He went there more like it. And I looked at him and I laughed. He went, no, no. Even Suzanne said I'm the right lines there. Is there anyone who has done a degree in maths or a level math that can bear. Carl won't believe this. Right? Carl thinks I was trying to. I know I was partly doing it to confuse him. Just see that look on his face like a cat. Right. But there is the. The chances with random numbers for the. For example, the lottery of getting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are no greater than any other single combination. Right? Now, that's true. I don't mean you're more likely to get 1, 2, 5 than any other combination put together, but then any other individual combination, they're all equal. It's counterintuitive. I know, I know you think that to get a run of one to six is less likely than anything else, but it's not any name to comb. It's not. Carl, if there's a problem, it's never happened. Yeah, but there's any number of combinations that never happened. Every one of those combinations that have come up have happened and they're just as likely or unlikely as any other combination. Right. It's just that you feel intuitively right that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 is less likely than 1, 7, 12, 34, 60. You know what I mean? Well, I didn't win. Play record. Okay. Wu Tang Clan Uzi on XFM. 104.9. Well, here we are the day before St. Patrick's Day. Oh, hooray. Brilliant. Guinness, etc. I hate people, I hate British English people, I should say, who are obsessed with celebrating St. Patrick's Day. You know, not crazy. It's like Chris Evans used to rave on about it. We're going to Dublin. We're going to get drunk. We're going. Wow. It's like it means nothing. I think XFM just did that to me. Well, yeah, exactly. Just as careful. Careful. They are employers. You don't know. You don't want to annoy him. What? What would we do without this? That's true. Yeah. Have an enjoyable Saturday. No, this is my favorite. Two hours. You like this, don't you? Well, we're not. We can't do this through May and June. No, we'll be gone. We got. We've got to record the second series, the Office. What are we going to do, Carl? What are you going to do on a Saturday? Host to show yourself. Doing up my own. You are not. Are you seriously thinking of it? If they ask you made you everything. Why, why would you not think about it? Cuz I. I've been there, done that. Next challenge, please. Oh dear. Do you know what. Do you know what St. Patrick did? Why he was revered as a saint and everything? What was he famous for in Ireland? He did he rid Ireland of something. I don't know, but I bet he started off with something odd happening in his life. What, you think he had asthma or something as a kid? They all do. And he took it out on what though? What did he say exactly? Took it out on something. What did he do? What did he rid Ireland of? St Patrick. St Patrick. This is why we're gonna get crazy and drunk tomorrow. This is why we're all so happy to celebrate his anniversary or whatever it is we're celebrating. This is why we. That's why we have a crack. Yeah. This is why we don't bother to celebrate, you know, the birthdays of James Joyce, you know, one of the great novelists of this century, or Samuel Beckett, one of the great playwrights. We actually celebrate this man, St. Patrick. The man. Don't diss him. He did a good job of it as well because there's none there now. There are none of these in Ireland. So he rid Ireland of something. Come on, Carl, think of something. Just give us an answer. He went around on a horse whacking them. And he went on a horse whacking them. Yeah. What was it, Carl? What did he read? Island of. Went on a horse. Foxes. Well, no, you're on the right lines. On the right lines. There's an animal. Oh, bears. Yes, it was. Wow. It was snakes. Right. And there are no snakes. He read Ireland of all the snakes. Yeah. Who did it here then? Because there isn't that many. Well, I think he had. He had a. Stab it over here as well, but got tired, went back. Yeah, that's why there's just a few snakes here. Is it true that there are no snakes in Ireland? I think it is. I think if someone call this. And what is there. Is there any historical evidence for St. Patrick reading them? I mean, how did he do it? Was it like the Pied Piper? See, I. I'm not convinced that he did go around because it was snakes. But there are no snakes in Ireland. And that's. Yeah, I don't think he is. Now, if someone knows, he's announced. We were someone. Just. We had a few probability experts and statisticians and maths graduates confirming that, indeed I was correct, that the probability of one to six in a row is no more or less likely than any other single combination in a totally random selection of balls. Which brings us back to Hitler, doesn't it? Because he only had one, didn't he? Coming up, we'll be asking Kyle all about Hitler, the education of Carl. He's done Rasputin, he's done Shavara, plus. Of course, White Van. Carl, where we. Carl, some of the, you know, his opinions on some of the hot potatoes of the week. You learn as you go along. Because you got something about St. Patrick there that was thrown in for free. That was an extra. I'll learn you something, eh, Snakes? Well, I'll. Sorry, guys, just stop me there and I'll teach you something. Right, go on, then. You don't learn someone something, you teach them something. It's. It's not one's passive. You. You learn. Ricky, I'm sorry, mate, but I don't think you should be teaching people how to speak or use grammar. I just don't think it's appropriate. It's like. It's embarrassing, frankly, because there's so many errors you're making. It's like. Where to start with you Snakes, right? You're talking about snakes. Yeah. A lot of snakes are born with two heads. It's like a. It's like a familiar type thing that's. That happens to snakes. Yeah. They take it for granted, don't they? Right? Snakes born two heads, they'll fight each other for food even though it's going in the same body. Ain't that weird? Were there kids at school that you went through who had two heads? Snake twins from Mosley. Was there. There was kids at your school with two heads, was that right? What? No, no, they had. They had big heads. They had big heads and webbed hands, but they weren't related. And they. They weren. Because that would have been too obvious. He said, yeah. Oh, Steve, listen, before you came in, right, I sneezed a couple of times. Now, if I'm allergic, I've still got a bit of a cold. And I said, oh, God. He went. He went, bloody hell. I was. I'm sorry. And he went. And he went, you know, you can't sneeze with your eyes open. I went, yeah, yeah. And then he was obviously thinking to himself, Still. And after a pause, he went, would your eyes really fly out? And I started laughing. He went, no, because that. Has anyone ever done that? Has anyone ever held someone down, torturing them and held their eyelids open and gave them pepper and see if their eyes would fly out? And he said. And then. And then he went. I'm just looking at him again, the silence. And he's. Then he went of his own accord. He just went, I can't see happening. Your song, Erick. Oh, this? Yeah. Bowie. Sorrow. Beautiful Sorrow by David Bowie. I've got that on a compilation today, but I think it's off originally off the Pinups album, the one we did all the covers. Because he didn't write that, did he? That was the one with him and Twiggy on the front cover, isn't it? Right. I haven't had that for ages. I haven't got that. So. Sorry, you lost me. I don't know what you're talking about. Are you reading the book there? No, I was just reading the. The brochure there. The program, if you will, for the Television and Radio Industries Club Awards that we went to. Incidentally, we. We lost. We lost to Linda Green. Yeah, we didn't win an award. The best comment. But you might be interested to know that Tom O'Connor is in constant demand for corporate functions both here and abroad. And his client list includes many multinational companies. No mean golfer. Tom took the literary world by surprise in 1992 when his first humorous golf book, from the Wood to the Tees, made the bestseller list. I noticed it didn't take the world by storm. No, it took you by surprise. They're going, we can't say storm. We can't. We got to say by surprise from behind. But. But his first humorous golf book, from the woods of the Tees, made the bestseller list. I don't know if that's just books about golf, that bestseller list. Subsequent successful books include One Flew over the Clubhouse, Brilliant Genius, Take a Funny Turn, Follow Me, I'm Right behind you. And Eat Like a Horse, Drink Like a Fish. Does it mention celebrity squares? Didn't he do that? No, he did Name that Tune. That's right. I was. It's crosswords. Do you remember crosswords? It was from the 80s. It was like a crossword game show. It was often with Kate Copstick, but I saw one where. It was on. It was on Challenge tv, bnb. They know Andy Crane. Remember Andy Crane? He was on the. He was the link man. And he went. Coming up next, Tom O'Connor with Crosswitz with. Well, in my opinion, one of the best Crosswitz players of all time, John Junkin. Oh, who's your favorite Crosswits player? It's got to be Junkin for me as well. But Copstick was. Cry is bloody good. Cry was good. Cry was good. I watched Call My Bluff in the. Week Is this with Toxic, and it was. It was quite good. I quite enjoyed it. Imagine you could get on there if you want. I used to watch it with what's his name. Yeah, yeah. Oh, great. You're brilliant impressions. Because obviously while Bowie was playing, you were doing your infamous Bowie impression, which is the best one you do, actually. Well, that's just because Carl said, you know what? I said, I'd love to go out for a drink with David Bowie, of all people that come in here for sessions. I think he's really good, him. And I said, I think he'd like you as well. That's all. And I just went, hello, Carl, you're strange, you're alien. It interests me, myself and Ian a lot to put you on the. Yeah, I just imagine you and Bowie in a pub somewhere. Isn't that pretty much the same impression you do when you do Ian Canfield? No, Ian Canfield's more like that. But not on air. On air he's sort of like this sort of eloquent 40 year old capital DJ. Yeah. And when you talk to him in. The studio, he's slowly turning into Tommy Vance, isn't he? This is one of his pillars of rock. Canfield. He loves Vance, Lemmy Diano. If we. If we run out of material later in the show, which is, you know, likely. Yeah. Considering we're now talking about. We ran out of it at five past one. Exactly. But could we. Could I maybe just sort of interview you as David Bowie? A sort of humorous sketch? Yeah, that would be fantastic. Maybe it could be the idea that. What if, like, David Bowie was, you know, a cab driver, what would he say? What was one of the funny things he would say? We saw that. That. What was that in when it said Dead Ringers coming up. If you've ever wondered what Dead Ringers. Is, this impressionist show, they did a. It's on Radio 4 and they did a TV version. I saw it. What did you make of it? I didn't like it. It was all right. No, it was just that the write up in said. Ever wondered what it'd be like if Robbie Williams was singing George Formby? Or what would it be like if. There was an animal Hospital was hosted By Anne Robinson. Yeah, yeah. You know, I have. I have wondered, was it. Were those two sketches on there last night? Yeah, yeah. What were they like? You are. You are the. You are the weakest dog. No, what was it? It was something like the. The devote off an animal to die or something. It was something like that. Yeah. It was flagging. Quick, do your Bowie again. Oh, come in here. Look, it's Tim Machine. Now let's play Changes. Hello, Iggy Pop, you nutter, stop cutting yourself. Which one? Travis Flowers in the window on XFM, 104.92 o'clock. Halfway through. Oh, this is our favorite time, isn't it? My favorite time of the week where we come in here and play some records, have a chat. Ricky, a lot of people are wondering who you are. I'm Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant. Hi. There's little Carl over there. Steve, it's time for White Van Carl. We should definitely get some jingles. I think it. The show sort of lacks jingles, I think. Yeah. Noises, funny sound effects. Yeah. Yeah. What's Mr. Nosy Neighbor interested? Hello. What's going on here? Oh, we should definitely get some pre recorded comedy noises. You know, that's my job, but unfortunately I'm busy reading about Hitler. For those that don't know and aren't familiar with this feature, basically the sun runs a White Van man column where it asks just people who, you know, every kind of every. Every men and women their views on news stories from the week. And we decided we'd just ask Carl his opinion on some of the same issues this week. Not like us to rip off another idea and just use our own. No, but this time, White Van man. In the sun this week is Herbie Crossman from Harrow and Middlesex. Herbie. And he's been, he's asked his opinion. Colin, what's yours on Pop Idol? Will Young admitting he is gay. It's. I don't understand what the big deal is, to be honest. Talking to different people about it and they've said, oh, it could affect the sales, you know, girls won't like him anymore. Which I think is. Is rubbish. Yeah. Because it finished yours. Michael's career, didn't it? Oh, yeah. And I was thinking when I was. Growing up, right, and Freddie Mercury, I. Was into King Wild. Right, sure. Now. And her kids. No, but she was. If they said, oh, she's, she's, you know, a leather. Yeah, right. I wouldn't say, right, that's it. I'm taking kids in America back to the shop. I'm Disgusted. Sure, I liked her. Yeah. I don't think I'm ever gonna, like, meet her and marry her and that, so what does it matter? Will Young, he's a good voice. He's gay. You know, a lot of gay people in the world. Georgia Boy was gay, I guess. There you go. Nothing more and nothing less. The kindest guy I ever knew. Do you Bowie? No big deal. That's one of your favorite songs, isn't it? Brilliant. Killing a Georgie parts one, two in it. Yeah. Okay. What do you make of the police protesting to Parliament over reforms? That's not the band. Before you say, all right, what's all that about? Okay, well, the police have had various kind of gripes and grumbles which they've taken to Parliament. Try and get them sorted. Like what? Well, it could take ages, basically. They don't like the pointy helmets anymore. Yeah. They want flat caps. They feel that their, you know, their powers are restricted. They get a lot of bad press, they're not being paid. They actually demonstrated, didn't they, outside? I think they may have done, yeah. At least they're doing something about it instead of just sitting there moaning. I mean, they're going to the top trying to sort it out. Yeah. I admire that. Yeah. What do you make of the police generally? Are they doing a good job? They've woke me up a couple of times at about 4 in the morning when I was a kid. Right. Was that because they were looking at. They were looking for your brother in his tank. Yeah. Did this Sherman tank just come through here? Yeah. No, my mates nick cars and gave my name and all that. Right. Were they friends of yours? All right, yeah. Yeah. Okay. What do you make of fears that. Dumped Britney Spears. She's been dumped by her boyfriend. There's worries that she may be cracking up. Carl. Are you concerned? What are the signs? Well, I'm not entirely sure. I'm just reading from this section. But I would assume that she's obviously showed signs of depression. Maybe she'll be all right. I remember, like, you know, Zoe Aris, when she sort of got bored of me when I was a kid. Yeah. Get over it. Don't even think about her now. What? And how long did it take you? How long did it take you to get over Zoe? Zoe Aris, to be honest, right. It was like one of my first girlfriends and she was a pain. I remember I went out with her because she won't stop asking me. Right. Yeah. Oh, God. I never talked to her. And then the bit that really Got me? I thought I half liked her. And then I remember, right, we're at a school party, sort of infant school. Infant school, right. Are you sure it wasn't junior school? Well, it's on the cusp. Yeah. When you're about to leave infants and go to the next one. Yeah. And she was crying. You were saying, I don't think we should move in together. She was crying. She was crying. Oh, was she? Had you stolen her milk? She must have been nearly six. Why did she grow up? She was crying because somebody had stood on a dress and put a bit of an hole in it. And I said, oh, for God's sake. I can't stand it. So you. I just thinking. So you gave her a slap. I just think of him like six, like with clogs and a flat cap, going slightly bald, going for cross egg woman. Come on. Oh, like my pipe. I finished it because all the mates were saying, come on, Carl, she's upset. And I was like, oh, whatever. Hold on though, wait a minute, what do you mean all the mates were saying, look, come on, Carl, they were six, weren't they? Yeah, but they were saying, come on, she's crying, help her out. And you did nothing. I don't. I got injured. Got all in a skirt. Yeah, but she was upset and you were her boyfriend. Well, so what did you do? Tell me the story. Where were you? Were at some kind of school do. There was a hole in her dress. It didn't work out. He said, do you treat your current. Girlfriend in the same way? This callous disregard for someone. His current girlfriend does not tread on her dress, does she? Oh, she didn't. So as far as you're concerned, what was her name? Sarah? Zoe. Zoe Harris. You just felt like, well, you know, she's gonna make a whinge about, you know, a silly little hole. Screw her. Yeah, you're all. You're all heart, Carl. What would you have done? I'd have gone over there and give her a lovely kiss. It wouldn't. Yes, I would. We were playing dead arm. Ask him another question. Very final thought then. What do you say to the fact that judge, a judge has decided that we, the general public, have a right to know about stars, flings, basically. This is an excuse. This is basically saying, should papers be allowed to print tittle tattle about celebrities? Oh, this is Providing it's proven true. Oh, this is something about, isn't it? A Division 1 football or something. It definitely had a premiership football and it is true. But he's trying to Keep privacy. And the judge said, well, it's not for us to censor the press over things that are true. It's up to the general public to either boycott or not. You know, that, that publication. Carl, what about all this, you know, exposing, going through the, you know, the bins of celebrities? It's not right, is it? But no, people are interested in it and buy the papers to read it. Do you know what I mean? I mean, like I said to you the other week, everyone has a go at Beckham for not being that bright. At the end of the day, it's a good footballer. Doesn't really matter what goes on. Yeah. Off the pitch, does it? You know what I mean? Yeah. So what if you were a celebrity and they sort of splashed over the front page the fact that you just, you know, didn't care less for Zoe Harris. Yeah. And her torn dress. Zoe Harris is still upset. Yeah. They dug her out. You know, the night Carl Pilkington reduced me to tears. Yeah. I haven't done anything that bad. Sure. I won't be worried. Did you win the dead arm contest? No. I was thinking about that the other day. Do you think there's a chance I could get blood clots in later life? Did you play that a lot? Yeah, a hell of a lot. Did you ever do it but like kind of headbutting? No. Okay. Because that would have explained something. Dead arms. Sure. Anymore? No, that's it. It was with people's blessing, was it? You had to give them a go. Yeah. And you played it with girls. No. All right. Oh, mates. Right. So you were playing Dead Arms while she was off dancing and getting her hole ruined. Yeah. You romantic, you. That's great. And you haven't changed a bit, have you? You still do that to this day, don't you? At functions and events. Oh, dear. What track we got here? Yes, I just thought I'd dig out some old Elliot Smith. I've quite enjoyed his work. And this was a previous single and the first track from his album, figure 8. Son of Sam. XFM 104.9. Sorry, I was going to announce that track and just mention it was Elliot Smith and the track Son of Sam. Well, I think I just better ask Carl a couple of quick questions about Hitler. Then we can. We can, you know, get on with our lives. Okay. Yeah, we can tick that particular box. Yeah. But that. Yeah. Okay. Carl, Dictator to bed. It's. We. It's. It's week three of his education. We've. You've nailed Rasputin and Che Guevara. I don't want to lose complete sight of those. I know. Maybe ask you a couple of those in the week, just to keep your. Your mind on it. But Hitler, what have you learned? Do you want to ask some questions? No, not really. Just, just, just, just, just sum it up in a minute. What is. What in a minute? Well, can I ask some questions? And it's. Where was he born? Austria. Tell us about his early life. Right? It was a young lady, like, okay, yeah. What's the name? He's is. His mum was his dad's second cousin, which is a bit weird. Yeah, that is weird. They had five kids. He's going, yeah, it's usually first cousin where I come from. Oh, that's unfair in it. There's no need for that. There was, there was five kids, but only two of them, including Hitler, including him and his sister, survived. The others died at an early age. Right. Anyway, so they grew up and the mum died and the dad died and that. And he thought, oh, what am I gonna do? Because he didn't do well at school. Didn't have many qualifications. No. Like tart. Did he have a GCSE in history? Like tart? Right. And then so he said, right, I'm gonna go to Munich. I missed a bit out, actually. Jewish people were in Austria. He didn't really like them. Okay. He thought they got, you know, special treatments and stuff and just didn't like him. So he went to Munich and he joined the army, right? Yeah, yeah. And he was in the army and he got injured, right. So he went to hospital. And whilst he was in hospital, the World War I ended and he was like, oh, God, I wanna. I was enjoying that. Yeah. You know, so don't, because you're breaking the concentration. Yeah, sorry. I'm not even sure I want to join in on this one. Just in case. Okay. Right, go on. Right, so. So he's in hospital. World War it gets a bit better. He's never that fit, though. He's one of these blokes who was always ill, that was on something like 30 tablets a day or something. Comes out of there, join some other army. God, you know, I knew it all this morning. I could see it running to ground. I just see his face going, I'm not nailing the fact, am I? And joined another army. And it was. Let's try and help you bit. Here's a good bit. I remember this bit. He thought that water men, right, was like childbirth is to women. That's how important he thought he Was. All right, right. So it's like, you know, you fight for nine months and at the end of it, you own something. Right? Yeah, yeah. So it goes on and all that. It's in Berlin. Yeah. And it's, you know, he's. He's. He's fighting his way through, like, you know, trying to take over countries and that. And he does. Does he do Berlin? Does he. Wait a minute. Is he. Is he. Is he chancellor yet? What year is it? 35. Let's skip the kind of claim to power then. He's now. He's now. He's now the dictator of Germany. Right. He's in charge. Yeah. And this is when, you know, he gets his own back on the Jewish people and that. And he's. He's. He's got his own little armies and he's setting fire to Jewish businesses and. And all this. And anyway, cut a long story short, he. Please do. He. When he came to, like, fighting Britain. Yeah. Came a bit sort of unstuck. Yeah. Right. Started fighting. Not so easy, is it, this world domination. Adolf. Britain was there. France was helping out. Yeah. Americans were helping out. Yeah. Oh, God. But, yeah. He goes into a bunker in Berlin. Yeah. And it's all kicking off. Yeah. And apparently, like, Germany sort of surrenders. Yeah. Says it's all over. Forget it. We can't beat you. He was really annoyed with this and he thought, oh, I can't show me face around here. So he. Because it would be embarrassing. He's with his Mrs. Who nobody knew was his wife. Right. Eva. In this bunker. Yeah. And so. So he said, I've had enough of this. He shoots himself. Yeah. She poisons herself and the chauffeur buries them or something or burns them. Right. And in all the time he was in charge, 50 million people died. So that's 1918 to 1945. Yeah. Between. Felt like that between Travis and the Red Hot Chili Peppers next week. That's fantastic. I have to say that you sort of lost your grass somewhere along the line because you started off confidently. But I've had a really busy week. And last night I was, like, whizzing through it. Sure. And then this morning I woke up and, you know, Suzanne had been away for about three days. Right. I. I hardly spoke to her. She's been busy. I've been busy. First thing to say when I wake up. Oh, just ask me some stuff on Itler. You are romantic. That's great. That's how stressful it's getting. But I knew it all this morning. No, but that's. That's fine. I think you've summed up that, you know, you've done that. Right. Just for a bit of balance, I've got your next week's homework. It's the same, same series. There's little books, there's tiny little books just 3 inches long by 2 inches wide. Crown with so much information. Winston Churchill. There you go. You'll enjoy that. Yeah, I'm getting a bit bored now, though. This is what happened in school. Think of the listeners did really well in infants once. Got to secondary loss interest. Was it the breakup between you and Harris and Zoe? I wondered if. Yeah, you spiraled into something there. Yeah. Because it's like all these other, you know, these men, these men of history, they always had sort of things happen in their early childhood, didn't they? Maybe yours is the Zoe Harris dress incident. Well, let's just refer to it as the Zoe incident. Yeah, from now on. Yeah, yeah. Winston Churchill. The bit I left out in the Hitler story. Hitler was scared of this man. Yeah. And I can tell you something else about Winston Churchill. Go on. He said he can remembers being in the womb and he was born in a public toilet. Flat record. PJ Harvey. This is Love XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant and Carl. Carl called me in the week. Steve, I know, I know, we're sort of banned each other from speaking to him. What? You seem to have just disobeyed that rule. I can't believe it. I just can't resist it. But he said, oh, just saw a program. He said, what's that big balloon that blew up? And the news reader was going all mental. And I went, is that the Hindenburg? He went, yeah. Oh. I said it was a big zeppelin. He went, yeah. You know what happened? It was helium, wasn't it? And I went, yeah. So it was a big. Just a huge zeppelin full of helium. And what caused us? I don't know, it could be a spark or anything. Of course it just goes because it's helium, so flammable. And he went, now, they didn't show this in the documentary, but did all their voices go funny? And I went, what? He went, well, no, if you take a little bit of. A little balloon of helium, your voice go funny. So if that was like millions of gallons of it and it blew up in the air and you were. And it was in the atmosphere, you'd be carrying, you'd be talking like Donald Ducky went, so imagine that. And. But what I liked about. I said this wasn't in the documentary. No, it's an oversight. Maybe just time was against them. They didn't have time to explain just like that. But that book about Hitler didn't have his one ball incident. Yeah, yeah. Oh, it's annoyed me that. What was the old Hitler book? Why? Just. Just because I knew it all, do you know what I mean? I was cycling in today. I was like, yeah, going through it all again. Yeah. Had it all in my head. But that's why you should know some as opposed to just cram and have a piece of trivia that's precariously sort of teetering on the edge. Were you not interested? That's what I mean. The most fascinating things, you know all. About, things you're interested in, you never forget them, do you? You know? Yeah, I was a bit interested in it. But like I say, I mean, I'm cramming all this in into a normal week. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, you go on and, you know, you watch telly and that in the week. You've got loads of leisurely time. I'm sort of using the only little bit of rest time I have to learn as well as try to do all my other stuff. Yeah. He texted me yesterday about Hitler. He went. He went, stop making me read this. Heavy. He said, I've seen in the. Of this book, there's one on Elvis. No, I mean, it is. It is interesting, but not when you have to read it. Do you know what I mean? But do you think you'd have read it in your leisure time? To be honest, no. You wouldn't. What do you do in your leisure time? I like, you know, going out for food and that. Foraging. What do you mean, going out for food? Come have a little hole and go if you're hunting. Yeah. This is Carl. Carl, he's hungry. He knows he has to get to the greasy spoon by 11. Wow. Many of Carl's close friends have never made it across this road. There was a zebra crossing installed just for the safety of. Carl can have a bacon body into. Carl is enjoying his wow. But he has to get back. His girlfriend's asked for one as well. She's home with a PlayStation 2. Wow. All right, Rick? It was David Bowie impressions earlier. Now it's just a selection of crazy sound effects. Like that guy in Police Academy. You said you wanted some. He hasn't got time to make him up. He's reading about Hitler. You heard him do a machine gun or a helicopter We've got to do. All our own sound effects. Oh. So do you want to. Do you want a week off? Do you not want to learn about Winston Churchill? Why don't you read it if you want to? And just. If you. If you get interested, then read on. I think that. Because that's what I did with school and it didn't work. No, you decided you didn't want to. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so. But hasn't that. Hasn't that taught you something? Can't you just do it like a TV series? It doesn't go on forever. We've done three weeks. Give it a rest now. For the. For like the summer. Yeah, because most series last for three weeks. Well, you know. Yeah. Okay. What. What's your favorite subject in the world? What's your favorite thing in the world? I would have said, what, at school, like. No, just in life. What's. What are you interested in? I like. I like little interesting bits, like sentences. Atlantic Ocean. It's got 17, quadrille, quadrillion gallons of water in it. Right. Well, that's. That's interesting without having to read a book. Why is that interesting, though? What are you basing on? What. When you. When you think of 17, quadrillion, what are you imagining? Just like a big wave. Imagine how much water. Yeah. What's your subject, then? I don't know. No, it's just that that Wilson was your favorite subject. You gave me a fact. That is so difficult thing. Like I said to you before, you were talking about monkeys, and I said, do you know that if you give a monkey a childbirth tablet, it works on it the same way because it's. It's kitted out the same. Could I just say something? We weren't talking about monkeys. What were we talking about now? No, we were talking about something and you went, if you give a monkey a child with. But it works. That's what you said. No, we were talking about monkeys. We were. We're talking about sneezing. Yeah. Yeah. And you went, if you give a monkey childbirth pills, it works. That's. That's. That's. Yeah, we were talking about interesting things about sneezing, and I remembered an interesting fact about monkeys. So. Anyway, brilliant. What did happen to that bloke who used to make the sound effects in Police Academy? I don't know. He was brilliant, wasn't he? Do you remember him? I don't remember him. Is he called Hightower? Yeah, it was good. Yeah. If anyone knows, give us a call. God. Blur, girls and boys, you've Embarrassed yourself then, Gervais. What? Well, we've had a number of calls and emails. Yeah. Pointing out that the Hindenburg disaster was not because the zeppelin was filled with helium. Hydrogen, but filled with hydrogen. Right, okay. Well, I thought about that when he told me. Yeah. But I assumed he must have got that off from the documentary. So it just, it just went up. So that's probably why the, the voices didn't go. That's probably why it didn't feature in the documentary. Yeah, but it seems to me we should have thought of that. I mean, like, it's school fates and stuff where they're like filling little balloons with helium. Yeah. You know, there'd be all kinds of horror stories if they were just, you know, just blowing up, you know, left, right and center. I don't think you just blow a helium up like that. Can you? Isn't that the point? What I'm saying is it's not, it can't be as potentially lethal as hydrogen. Helium. Well, hydrogen isn't as bad as helium. No, helium is not as bad as hydrogen. I don't know what you're saying, because that Hindenburg was hydrogen. Yeah. And I'm saying why did we think it was helium? That's crazy. You go to fate school fates and stuff with like little kids and they're filling up little balloons with helium. They wouldn't have big canisters of helium, you know, a charity event or a, you know, a small kind of bringing by sale if it was deadly. Yeah, but it's not as big. I mean, when you buy those balloons at a fair, it's not as big as that, that, that presumably it's still flammable, is it? But it was, it wasn't the fact how dangerous the, the rare gas was or that. It was the fact that it was made of this thing that caught fire and just went. There was nothing. A hole in it would have been as bad. It just, it just burnt quickly and fell to the ground. Because the hydrogen or helium escaped. It wasn't. It was irrelevant that what the gas was. I thought it was. There was supposed to be some kind of explosion. Well, I don't know what it was, but the point is because the outer thing was so thin, Right. The, the gas inside escaped and it fell to the ground. It just fell to the ground. Like one of, like when you've popped a balloon. Well, not, not. It didn't like flap all over the place and make a zany noise. But I'll tell you what, because when I was looking on the Internet in the week for it. I was like trying to get a bit more info on it. Guess how many balloons it would take helium balloons to lift a human up? Go on. Six thousand. Should we do it? Brilliant. Next week. That's got to be a challenge. Is there a sort of balloon company or some sort of, you know, party company that are willing to sponsor us to lift Carl into the air with helium balloons 10ft off the ground we're tethering down. Right. Is there someone willing to pay for 6, 000 balloons to try and lift? We can maybe get some kind of company to sponsor it. I'm thinking like Electrolux. If they're going to sponsor puddings. If they're going to sponsor Puddings, you know, and celebrities. Russ Abbott, they will sponsor Carl being lift. Heat magazine. Heat magazine. Come on. They're big selling, very successful magazine there and they've know about Carl because they've mentioned him. Heat magazine. Can we have a heat balloon? Yeah. Oh, 6000. Yeah, 6. Yeah. It's the Heat 6000 Carl Challenge. Lift Carl 10ft into the air. Come on. What about if it was Carl and Dr. Fox? We could get two different balloons. I think we need a lot more than six. A lot more mixed. Yeah. The height I just explained what I'm laughing at, right. We just had a call from someone saying his company was sponsor Carl, right, To be raised by all these balloons if he could have a walk on part in the office. And we immediately went, oh, we're worried about that sort of thing. You can't really promise that. Artistic, you know. And I was worried about the legality of it as well. How can you promise someone that for personal gain? That's a private and all that sort of stuff, right. And I went, oh, I don't know. And anyway, put the phone down to him. And Carl went, I love the fact you're more effing worried about that than me being raised 30ft in the effing air. You started getting scared, did you? Are you worried about it? You're quite excited about the idea of the challenge though, aren't you? I like the idea but I want like. Why do you like the idea, Paul? Oh, what if it went all wrong and we're there going, oh, the humanity of it. I think we need. He's just, he's just turning around. The rope would pull out my trousers. Oh no, it's definitely gotta be Dr. Fox if that's gonna happen. Oh God, we've gotta do this. So hang on. But let's just think about The. Because, wait a minute. I mean, we say this, but we'd have to get all kinds of health and safety people involved. No, we. No, we wouldn't. Of course, we can't just start raising. You in the air. No, you're allowed to do it on private land, aren't you? Look what happened to the Hindenburg. No, but that was. There was. I was just saying there was. Lots of people died. Listen, look, all we do is we get. We get someone, right? But what if. What if he. He gets loose and he just floats off into the air? We know it. And he meets his magpie that he lost. He used to peck his grifter balloons. So. I'm so excited about this. Listen, we've got to do this. Let's stop and think about it. It's 60,000 balloons, but 6,000. That's a lot of balloons. No, it's not. No, no, it's not. For sponsorship. People pay for. No, listen, it's worth it. There must be a company out there that'll pay for this just so we can film it. Is there not an easier way of just getting one big balloon, then? The challenge is. There's no challenge. No, it's gotta be. It's gotta have people coming up and hooking balloons. It'd be like Buckaroo. And the person who puts the balloon that actually raises him 10ft wins a prize or something. So, hang on, so what we got, we've got each person with, like, 500 balloons. Yeah. That's mad. Can you imagine how many balloons that is? That's ludicrous. 6,000. Yeah. That's an awful lot of balloons. I don't know. There must be someone that. That could do this. Oh, look, people have walked on the moon, for Christ's sake. We can raise Carl Pilkington with some balloons. Yes, but they had a NASA budget. We've got XFM behind us. Yeah, balloons are cheap. You can get about a pack of 25 for about 150. Right, fine. No, true. Yeah. The helium, though. Carl, you can't just, like, attach yourself to a pack of balloons. No, but what do you think? We blow them all up with helium. Right. Oh, off you go. But then we can do something with the balloons, can't we, like, release them afterwards? Oh, we'll release them back into the wild. Brilliant. As a sign of peace, fly, my pretty, slide, be free. I am so excited. I've not been so excited about. And I thought that Robin Ince was gonna stay in my cupboard for a thousand pounds. Look, we've Got. We've got to do this. 6,000 balloons. I don't think it's gonna happen. That's an awful lot of balloons. And I just don't think. I don't see how we can tether them all to Carl. He's a small man. No, because different lengths. Don't you? Yeah, exactly. Carl knows. Can you think about the logistics of this? Oh, someone must know. There must be a company. There's a bloke willing to do it. I know. He doesn't know the technology of it. He's willing to sort of stumble. Company just has access to helium like that. No, we can do this. Come on, London, Londoners. It was on the Internet already, so someone obviously has done it. Yeah. So they didn't say, oh, we can't get all of the balloons now. They probably worked out, didn't they? Carl, you're more excited about this than anything else. About your education, about your exam results. You're so excited. And we'd have a little rope. It'd be like flying a little kite. A little. Carl, let's go. What were you wearing? Like a one piece jumpsuit? Yeah. I mean, that'd be sponsorship all over it. Oh, it'd be great. You know, Jackie Stewart and just as you go up your little face. Oh, my God. I'm not gonna sleep until this is done. This is the most exciting thing ever. Only 10ft. 10Ft? Yeah. We need some kind of rope to sort of tether you to the ground. Yeah. I want you sort of flying. This is gonna be great. And you'd have a little crush helmet and everything. And little dee dee boppers on the crush helmet. Like, he's a little flying. Give him a little. Oh, my God. Can we give you an outfit like little wings and everything? Can we paint your face with, like. Children'S paint, all that? Why? Because that'll be silly. Oh, please, Carl, do this. Do it. We're doing for charity. We'll do it for charity. Yeah, all right. Yeah. Oh, this is do it for Children in Need. Please just phone in if you've got. If you can help us lift Carl up 30ft. Let's say 30. I think it has to be a decent. Yeah, it has to be a decent one. Is there a world record? Because we want to break that. Yeah, I want to break that. What is the world record for raising a man by balloons? Yeah. Okay, so listen, let's just. Let's just finalize details here. We've got. I'm so excited. Email address ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk. ricky.gervaisfm.uk what's the number? Number, Carl? 0870800 1234. Lift car. Oh, 8, 700, 800 1234. Sponsored by Heat magazine, maybe even. If you've just got an idea about how we might be able to organize it, how we're able to get it done, if you've got contacts, anything, just get in touch, give us some information. Oh. Oh, that'd be great. I'm going to play a Beatles track for Song for. For the Lovers. Oh, man, it's. It's off the Help album and it's. You've got to hide your love away. Oh, just think of his little face as he goes up. Tune in, folks. Listen to your station. Invite your neighbors over to listening with you. Extra famous. Well, XFM was nearly the end of the show. I'm Ricky Gervais, with me, Steve Merchant. We've enjoyed company, Carl. We're going to try and get Carl in the air. Anyone that can help us take him up with helium balloons. Our friend Johnny Mango called again and apparently the record's 11,000ft. Carl is getting a little bit nervous. Yeah, the world record is 11,631ft raised by hot air balloons. How tall is Canary Wharf? It's 11,631ft exactly. I don't know, Kyle. Well, is it. How much higher? It's a long way. I'm not doing a lot because I'm like six foot something. Yeah, think of that. Just look at Steve. All right. Yeah, but you can change your record. You could say, well, the sort of balloons are the one with. With Mickey Mouse on it or something. Yeah, could I just. Could I just say something? That man did 11, 000ft, but he wasn't naked. All right, come on, Carl. You'll be the. Your 30ft will be the world record for naked ballooning. Yeah, Think about it, all right? It's for charity. Well, thank you for listening, everyone. We are going to raise Carl. We are going to raise Carl. And after. After Carl said. And just to think my teacher said, I'd never be a high flyer. So this is your chance, Carl, to shine, to fly. It'll be brilliant. This is a final song for the ladies. Spelling Sebastian. We've not heard them for a while. This is from. It's actually a B side or a triple side or whatever you call it. Track three on a single called Jonathan David. This is the beautiful the Loneliness of the Middle Distance Runner. Goodbye.",
