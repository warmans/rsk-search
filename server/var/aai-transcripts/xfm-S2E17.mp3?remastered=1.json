You don't know it. You don't know it. Manchester's better than London. Instead, Claire Sturges. The camouflage gear. I know, is that quite trendy? Is that what the kids are wearing? Someone actually mentioned maneuvers. Yeah, actually, yeah. Taking time out this morning from what I normally do. Sure, I missed the second half. Talk like that of Celebrity Boot Camp. Is it the fella from Medi Vanilli? What, the one that's not dead? No, the one that killed himself. Steve. Okay, I just want to clarify for people. A lot of people don't realize that one of them is dead. Right. I thought it was important to mention it, actually. Yeah. I didn't know. I'll be honest with you. I hadn't thought it through. No. It was a piece of interesting Milli Vanilli trivia that I had, and I wanted to slip it in because it was a question. You went, what? The wine is not. Because I could have found a more tactful way of bringing up the death of one of Milli Vanilli. Because I think there's a lot of people out there now upset, maybe people who didn't know. That's quite a shock. I didn't. I mean, I should have sat people down. Who died, Vanilli or Millie? I think it was. I think it was Millie. I don't know. No, but I didn't know, actually. I'm guessing I'm not confusing Squirty Polity, because, I mean, that is a danger. Oh, no, you're. You're thinking of the fellow Grandpa Palumpal. He was amazing. He was amazing. This is a great shame that he. Yeah. Anyway, cool. We got some great tunes lined up. We're gonna play today the. Our favorite singles. Favorite tunes, some of which didn't quite make it as singles maybe, but tunes of the year because obviously Christmas very soon. And we'll be away for a short. I think next week we'll be doing our favorite Christmas songs of all time. Yeah, I'm worried we're not going to fill two hours with that. I mean, how many times can you play Shaking Stephens before? Very down New York. Yeah, exactly. That's the only one, isn't it, really? That's the best one. That's the best Christmas. That one's good. But obviously there's Joni Mitchell's the River. That starts with a kind of Christmasy feel. Beautiful. I don't think if there's anything else. Not great deal. Christmas wrapping. Is that one. Is that brilliant? Is that good? So this is Christmas. John Lennon, Paul McCartney came out with simply having a wonderful Christmas time. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So John's was. Happy Christmas. War is over. Ye. Yeah, of course it wasn't. But hey. But I mean, at least he. What he wanted. No, she was dreaming of it. He was dreaming of it. Yeah. I mean, bless him. And to show John Lennon's dead as well. I don't know if anyone's. Yeah, no, they do. That's just another bit of. I like John's. John's protest against war. He stayed in bed for a week. Yeah, I've been doing that. I've been protesting his war for ages. Yeah, I'm eating hamburgers. Yeah, absolutely. I went. I just got into Burger King on the way here. I went into the. I went to the counter. But of course that's not. I mean, not product placement there. And there's a number of other burger joints that people may wish to go to if they. But I went into Burger King because it's. It's close, it's convenient. But then often McDonald's will be convenient. Convenient. McDonald's is just as convenient. Depends where you are. Just as convenient. Depending where you are. And I said. I said, could I have a cheeseburger and small fries take away, please? And he recognized me. He went, oh, I've seen you on today enough one. Yeah. He went, there's your meals. And I went, thanks. He went. He winked and went, I'll put large fries in. Brilliant. So it's paying off at last. True geniuses being rewarded. Because, I mean, there's been a couple of times where I've been with you and you know, we've gone to a restaurant, someone's given you a free meal or whatever. It's the way that it's like you don't ask for it, it's just kind of offered. But I don't know what they're expecting in return. Nothing. I mean, do they think that you'll go away and you'll always think fondly of. You know, I just think they think, oh, I don't know, they make. I'm giving a little treat. Yeah, I know, I don't like it. But then I'm always grateful and I never. Yeah, but the thing is I'll. Yeah, I'm. I'm slightly embarrassed. Did anyone around you hear what had happened. No, because I imagine their resentment just the whole room. No, they didn't. I had to go around telling him, excuse me, did you hear that? He just gave me the free thing because I'm on the telly. And I went, I don't recognize. I went, you don't recognize me? I'm terrified now that. That someone could be listening at Burger King hq. You know, assuming this is an unorthodox procedure, they know it's Leicester Square now, because I just mentioned it. So they know which Burger King it is. Oh, my God. I don't know. What was his name? Ralph Littleton. He had a Name badge number 342. Well, I just hope Littleton doesn't get in trouble. So what are we gonna. That could be a sad Christmas for him. He's probably keeping his whole family afloat. Bit of Springsteen. Well, tunes of the year. I mean, I know people dismiss Springsteen, but as I say, the gig I went to see earlier in the year, I made it. Sturgis couldn't believe Springsteen. Brilliant. I just think, you know, leave aside what you think is cool and trendy and the fact that he's older and whatever else, really just leave all that behind and just listen to the tunes because, you know, he remains a great musician. Lonesome Day. Lonesome Day's current single and the first track on the. The album. Free Chips. Absolutely. That's brilliant. The Boss. Do we care if it's trendy? We're like Huey Lewis. It's Hip to be Square. We should play some Huey. We can't, can we? No. I'll come on the Power of Love. No. It's a curious thing. Ye. Yeah, yeah. Makes one man leave another man sing. I don't know what's going on there. It's weird, isn't it? It's strange. Oh, flipping heck. Springsteen there. Yeah. No, obviously he's playing again next year sometime. I bet even trendy people thought, well, yeah, it's all right. But I mean, I bet they wanted to drive along a freeway. Well, I think you've got to be hard pushed to turn over the channel if you're driving and that's playing. Who wouldn't want to be driving a car while that's playing? You know, down an open freeway? We are sound. I know there's a little bit of irony in it, but we are sounding like Dr. Fox. Did you see. Did you? The final of Fame Academy? No, I don't watch Fame Academy. I don't. Foxy got in there. He was in the audience. Not enough Being on Pop id, always in there. And do you know who was sitting next to him? In disguise. In disguise. He had a little. A little beard and a woolly hat on. Look like Bad Drawn Boy. Mackenzie Crook, really. And we had to. We taped it. Yeah, yeah. And I went, it is. And we tapped it and he was there. So he's back from America. Is it obviously a false beard? No, no, I think he's. Is he befriended Foxy? Are they hanging out together now? Tonight we're gonna see. What was he doing in the States then? What was he doing? In fact, he probably is wearing a beard. He plays that. We can't say too much about it. He's playing a pirate, I think. Yeah, yeah. Oh, we'd make a good pirate. Yeah, exactly. So far, he's been cast as a pirate and a ghost, which seems to make sense. Yeah. Oh, dear. So that's me. I'll be probably pumping in for information about Foxy because, you know, I'm a big fan of Foxy's. You know, I know both a DJ and a medical man. I like that. I like the way that you got Pumping and Foxy in the same sentence. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Y. I love to calm down. Did you just say you're gonna see him tonight? Is it Comedy wars tonight? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's the big deal. Yeah, yeah. You're going, obviously. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What you wearing? What you wearing? What are you wearing? Very boring, I'm afraid. What? Very traditional tuxedo tuxedos. We've. We went shopping together and bought them. It's quite sad. I don't know. I should have said that I lost a certain degree of rock and roll. Cool. Because I went straight in. I went 42 chest, 36, 30 leg. That's fine. Right, Steve. I had to. Then I had, though, looking at Steve trying about nine jackets, so the arms weren't too short. Yeah. I suggest at one point go down to London Zoo and see what the gibbons wear. Because it's every single jacket you see them wearing. There's an organ grinder now. Who's making those? I want one of those. Six foot nine. Oh, dear. Have you got the cummerbunds and things you've got? Well, this is the thing my father phoned up. You know, I have conversations with my parents, which are always. They'll phone up and it'd be like, all right, how's it going? What you having for tea? Probably having a lovely. I'll probably have a spaghetti Bolognese tonight, dad. Oh, yeah. What have you Had, Dad. Oh, your mother just made a lovely lasonia, Steve. I mean it literally. That's the conversation. It's like, yeah, every other. Every parent is just. They're just interested in food, Food that you've eaten, food you're planning to eat, food you've enjoyed in the past, because they just want to know you're eating. And then. Have you got enough vitamin C? Got enough vitamin C tablets? Because I can always send you some. I can buy them myself, then I'll send you some. It's not. I don't need to. So anyways, I say. He says, wolfie, done. You know, And I'm trying to think. I think to myself, he'll be impressed if I've bought a tux. I say, I bought a tuxedo. Will he like that? Yeah. He said. He said, you bought a tuxedo? Why didn't you rent it? I said, well, it was quite cheap. It went out cheap. Told him the price. He went, no, it's not bad. Not bad, Elaine. He just bought a tuxedo. He just bought a tuxedo, Elaine. Yeah. He said, have you. You got a cummerbund? I said, a cummerbund? I said, do I need a cummerbund? He said, well, you're gonna be dancing. Like he knows. Like he knows. Like he's some kind of. Like, I don't the man's ever worn a suit, let alone a tuxedo. What does he know about dancing? I just. The idea of him being at some kind of do. And rightly. Length jackets off. Cummerband's off. Time for a dance, you know? Cummerbund. Do you. You wear it over your braces, then? Because those things are. Because you're not wearing a belt, I assume. No, you wear it under the braces, I think. No. Do you? I don't wear it over it. Don't you? Over the belt? But braces is a different thing. There's no belt. Well, no, you're right. No, you're right. It is over the braces. Sorry. How many people tuned to XFM are worrying about the etiquette of COVID buttons? This is important because the comedy wars, which is going on, it's live, Ton. Yeah, I know. Yeah. Well, that's. I'll tell you this, Rick, I tried on the tuxedo boy yesterday. I got a new shirt as well. I look like James Bond. I'm not gonna lie to you. No, I do look like James Bond. I look exactly like him. It's uncanny. It is uncanny, really, because the bloke in There. Said, you look like a lanky streak of piss. And I looked good. No, no, no, no, no. He did, he did. Because as you were walking out the shop, he called me back in and said, you know that. I know. That was for show. That was for show because when the very last time when you looked like. He said you look like Odd Job. No, he said. He said you look like Blofeld. You were definitely on the gym, he said, drinking secret piss with a stupid gingery blonde hair. He. A combination of blue, he said. Richard Ashcroft on XFM 104.9. That, that, that's in the top five for me, the singles of the year so far. Well, yeah, we're talking about what we talk about comedy awards, your dad. Cummerbund. My father's coming. I'm sure it is over the braces, I think. Yeah. Well, if anyone knows that. If anyone knows the. The kind of rules. So are you actually wearing. Are you actually wearing a common. Well, I asked if he said no. He said, don't bother. No. But then I'm thinking, what if I dance? Well, if I do some grooving later. You shouldn't. Why not? Well, I've seen you. Don't give me that. No, no, don't give me that. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. It's not that you're not in the office. That's your best dancer. No, it's not that you're not a bad dancer. It's the, the you. I've seen you hit people in the face with your elbow, so there's always going to be casualties. I've danced with Steve. Have you? I know, at one of indie discos, at you League. There you are. You've never forgotten. And he's good. I tell you. The only problem is because I'm so tall. Because I'm so tall, I do tend to tower like two foot above everyone else. And that does make me look slightly freakish. I wasn't gonna use that word, but I can see where you're coming from. So I do feel slightly self conscious. Why don't you hold them? Why don't you carry them when you're dancing with them? So they're. Well, no, but the thing is, because. You could dance with Jeanette cranky and still not look too weird. Sure, but that would be weird. Would it? You holding Jeanette cranky and dancing with her? Would that be weird? I think we've all had that fantasy. But what I tend to do is because I'm conscious that everyone is kind of can see Me and I'm sort of, you know, I'm quite visible on the dance floor. What I'll tend to do is maybe dance on any kind of podium that they might have in some of the bigger dance clubs or, you know, any kind of stage. I just get out there, bust some moves. Yeah. Because then it's like, you know, I may as well put myself on public display. Yeah. Rather than just people thinking. Because then you're going, look, I know what I look like. Yeah. I know how great I look, you know. No, no, no, no, no, no. Cuz it's what, you know what your, that's your opinion if you don't think it. But that's again, a lot of jealousy. I mean, he went for the normal shirt, I went for the, the wing collar. I just thought I might as well. I do like a wing collar, actually. Yeah. What about a proper bow tie? I bought. I went a bit berserk. I even bought Union Jack cufflinks. It's the British Comedy Awards. Nice. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. I mean you've got, you're in so much cash now that you don't know what to do with it, aren't you, really? I mean, I. What it is you're spending on. But yeah, I said, how much that went? I said, not expensive enough. I said, I'm going to give you an extra tenor. Talking about when his dad said that and then you told me so that I find. Am I amazing? Oh, well, the thing is, yeah, it's Christmas, obviously, I've got to go back to Bristol. I love seeing my family. Well, yeah, I do, but it means I'd see my grandparents who were, you know, brilliant people. I mean, lovely people, but mental, I mean, utterly mental. And they've taken now to. There must be sort of 80 a piece and there is quite an old age, but they're fairly good health, relatively speaking and they just spend their time in bed. I mean, that's all they do is that, that's their profession, that's their. They've retired to go to bed and they spend all the time in bed. I tell you what, they're like, they're like that old guy. They're like all that old family in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Remember none of them had got up for like 25 years. Yeah. And they, you said that they go to bed and they go to sleep, but then when they wake up, what they do is put an extra pillow so they' slightly more upright and that's. Them in the day, that's the daytime thing. But they don't cook and stuff. Well, yeah, what they do is they see they've got. They've got about six teeth between them. I mean, my grandmother wants false. Needs false teeth, but refuses to go and have the old ones extracted in the false teeth fit. So she's. She's working with about three or four teeth. My grandfather had false teeth given to him during the war. Wooden ones. Well, it was. It was plastic teeth on a wooden pallet. Right. That sits at the top of the mouth. He's still got the wooden palette, but most of the teeth have come off. So there's about four teeth left. Four false teeth. He's got. He's got a set of false teeth that make him look like he needs false teeth. I mean, that's pretty bizarre. So the problem is that they have to get up. They get up about 7 in the morning to put on, say, you know, some beef or lamb, whichever they're going to cook. They put it on at six in the morning, seven in the morning, so that by the time they eat it at six at night, they can use it. Use the phrase, this is what a good meal is for my grandparents, if they can use the phrase, oh, that's lovely, that's lovely. You could suck it away. You could suck it away. Who wants that from a roast dinner? You may as well blend it up and serve it as a bowl. I don't want that phrase coming from old people without teeth. Because it must remind you of your rent boy days. Exactly. It brings it all flooding back. Oh, God. Flooding's the word. Before we get really disgusting about your grandparents, we've said the word blowjob far. Too many times today. And with. In the same sentence as you. I. Anyway. And it's Christmas. Yeah. Don't they forget what Christmas is about? Come on. Spare a thought for the underprivileged people. Is it Ben Queller? Do you want a bit, Ben? I don't know. Are you a fan? I love him. Yeah. This is a cracking tune. Yeah. And I think we'll enjoy that. Slam dunk it. Why don't we just stop and think about what we've done? I'll tell you, this thing they do spend so much time in. In bed that they actually. I'm sure war will have to. Ben Queller. In other words. Fantastic. That ended is. Oh, God, it's like Ben fold 5. Bit of old Elton. That's great. You had him in session, didn't you, Claire? Yeah. Did you meet him or did you? Because he's quite young, isn't he? He's very young. He came in about six months ago to do something for John Kennedy and. And I also a session for me and I've been repeat. I repeated it this week as the best of the year sessions because it was. He did three songs. Stunning stuff. It just came in the piano, was it? Or him in a guitar. It was just. Yeah, it. Him. Yeah, him with a couple of instruments. Stunning. And also he did. He did a Ding Walls gig for XFM listeners and the reaction from the listeners phoning up, trying to get tickets was incredible. It really has touched a nerve. Yeah, well, like you say, Ricky, I mean, it's really. It's great. Well, I've just seen as we were talking, there's a kind of lack of music that sort of seems to be making use of instruments and sort of. And just the sound you can make with a piano and a guitar and drums. You know what I mean? It's. It's like. It's so invigorating and you get kind of stuff like, you know, the streets and whatever else or, you know, kind of hip hop and stuff and fact that a lot of. Please have seen Miss Dynamite on Top of the Pops last night using a live band. Really kind of. It really made the whole of R sound really exciting. Better than the other one. Yeah. Anyway, that's us being mus. Being terribly muso. I like it. Yeah. That's enough of that. Well, we are playing our favorite records. Well, it's nice to be able to. Talk sensibly without Carl interrupting with some gibberish. I mean, bless him. I don't see. He's probably listening on sky or Sky864. Channel864. Or around the world on xfm.co.uk get that in. Is that what you have to do? What'd you do today? Just go into the website? Do you go into the website? Yeah. And click on. I never get things like that to work on my computer. Or you can go and check out the webcam, obviously, and see me in the camouflage gear. Yeah, you won't see now. So what'd you do? Just go into the website and what does it say? Play live online? Yeah. And it's just like listening down the phone line. Yeah. I sound like I've come from the 90s. You've come from the 19th century. What's this? I'm not very, very. I was gonna say something then, but I can't. Just very quickly before we move on, because I get very excited about Comedy Wars. Now I know what you're wearing and you've got. Got a table with all your mates there. Is Jonathan Ross doing it again. Yeah. That's why it's my favorite. And I hate awards. I do honestly hate them. But this is actually an event because it's Jonathan Ross. It's just. Well, I am. I was. Because I'm talking to someone about it and I might mention it before, but we did it. Award. So we went to an award ceremony last year where everything was sponsored by corporate groups, you know, by businesses or by, you know, differently. It was a kind of. It was. Everything was sponsored and I swear to God, the pudding was sponsored by Electrolux. Yeah. And I've never eaten a pudding before sponsored by anyone. And, you know, it's really odd affair that. I thought that was very strange because it seemed as though corporate people had paid for a table so that they. So when we came out, someone came on stage and said, well, we've got a lovely number, a wonderful collection of celebrities here this evening. O And it was pleased. Be upstanding for your chairman, Tom O'Connor. We were made to give Tom O'Connor standing ovation. We had to stand up so we. Could give Tom O'Connor, former presenter of Crosswit. Yeah. A standing ovation. We're talking about the cream of British TV talent giving him a setup. Not that he doesn't deserve it. I'm sure he's a great entertainer, but I think Sir Cliff was there, wasn't he? See the back of the stage this week? I don't want to talk about it. It's too embarrassing. Tom O'Connor's on there thanking. Thanking MAU. Yeah. On BBC for giving him a part in Doctors. Yeah. I love that. He had to take out a whole. He obviously spent the feed being paid for the show. He's just so pleased to be back on tv. What an advert, he said. Yeah, a whole page thanking the BBC for having him back on time. Well, we're laughing, but it's gonna happen to you. Exactly. Oh, God, no. Bad behavior. Who do you think's gonna behave badly this year? Because I don't think anyone, you know. Well, we've had. We had. We had the Barrymore and Clary Cl. Listing and Barrymore. Yeah. Throwing his monitor. That was the heron. What was she. There's not really any sort of. There's not really any kind of wayward people at the moment, is there? In showbiz, in terms of entertainment comedy, there's no one who sort of seems to Have a drink or drugs problem. I'm worried about Ricky, sadly. I'm worried that, you know, something might take hold. No, I think he's very careful. He's a bit careful, yeah. I mean tired. Yeah, too tired. Shout and scream. You have been kind of coughing and wheezing throughout today. I had a fight, didn't I? Oh, we should talk about the fight. Yeah. We can't talk about the result. We can't give the result out on the fight. But I've got a cough. I just got a cough again. I'm scared I'm allergic to summer. What if I'm allergic? I was worried today, what if you're allergic to wheat? Oh, no. Well, that'd be terrible. But I was worried. What if I'm allergic to my cat? Get rid of it. Oh, no. Well, I. Well, it seems that easy, but. Well, it is lazy. Throw it out the window. That's how I sort out that. I'm not a trained doctor, but that's how I sort out. I just like to apologize for any. But they always land on their feet, don't they, Kev? And he's got nine lives, so if it lands on a spike, he'll be fine. What happened to me? You can't laugh cuz you. Cuz of the fight in the ribs. Oh, yeah, yeah. I have to say though, that I remember we were talking on the radio about what Ricky should come out to. For the big match. For those that don't realize, Ricky at Christmas, there's a TV show on Ricky. I don't know why, even to this day, why you agreed to do it, nor do I, but he's doing a celebrity boxing match fighting and he was described at the beginning of the fight. Rick, I don't realize if you. I don't know if you know this. He was described as entrepreneur. Grant Bovey, husband. I don't know what that means exactly. Well, he does bits of business as businessman. Yeah. Businessman. Entrepreneur. Yeah. But, yeah, you were described as, yeah, I think fat, funny man or a comedian and actor. But uk, yeah. Ricky came out to Mama said knock you out by LL Cool J. Nice. I think. I don't know whose suggestion it was. I think it might be mine, but it was blinding. And I noticed you were really. They'd obviously. I mean, it was ludicrous, really. You came out in the shorts. You had the. Well, I was acting out. They were going. Don't you laugh, don't you laugh. All my corner. And I really. I think I overdid. It didn't I. Well, you. He was kind of prowling around the ring, staring every. Staring Bovey out and staring the crowd out and kind of looking really. Oh, yeah. But of course, he's got this ludicrous beer belly. Do you know what I mean? So it looks like. It looks like Johnny May. Yeah. And Bovi looks quite sort of athletic. He's really. So he looks like he could actually be a boxer. But did you have. Did you have, like, the. I'm obviously the. Filming it for telly. Did you have the production crew saying, right, stop. Can you just do that? Throw that punch again? No, no. I think people surprised. I think they're going to see it's a real. And I tell you, it's unpleasant. I mean, it's actually an unpleasant. Okay, well, I'll tell you what Carl said. And he said to me, I can't do his accent. He went, oh, no, it wasn't nice. No, it was. It was. I have to say, I was really kind of riled up by it. I mean, I've never been to a fight before and I just was like, come on. I was like, smash his face. I was really shouting. I was just going. Shouting for me, though? No, I was shouting for you. And then I was. Then I just decided to try and freak everyone. So I was shouting, kiss him. Snog him. Lick him. Ask. Ask him out. I was shouting that in a vain attempt to throw someone. And it was extraordinary. But I'd say, I think. Because I think you beat better off. Like, if they sort of brought back wrestling. Wrestling from the 70s. Yeah, exactly. You've got more of the physique for wrestling. I think I'm too young for wrestling. I think I'm 58. One of them. Les Keller. Yeah, but the outfits are fun. Oh, they get. Yeah. A bit too tight, weren't they? Yeah, it was always that kind of shiny. Whatever preceded Lycra, I know. With just a little winkle showing. Little winkle. Little. Little mother with a little winkle in their tight shorts. Why you looking? Oh, I've done you Play record. I've done you well. Answers, please. I'm not. I'm not one of them. You're not looking at right now. Yes. And those are the Red Hot Chili Peppers. And they're still going strong. Indeed. Yes. That's one of my favorite tunes of the year. Yes, absolutely. These are all mutual. We. We love them all. We're not. We're not really. Yeah. We're not annoying each other by putting in songs the other one doesn't like we're like a team today in it. I think that's the Christmas spirit. I don't know what it is. We've come together. We sort of unified. Yeah, yeah, yeah. In the absence of Carl. Yeah. Who often divides us. He often comes between us. Does he? Yeah. Well, I say what it's like. It's like it's like a child. Like, it's like we're a married couple and he's sort of our autistic child or something, you know, and sometimes it just puts a strain on the marriage. You know, we. You know, we all three of us love each other. Yeah, exactly. But sometimes you hear him talking about you in the office. Sometimes, you know, he looks up to. He aspires to you, too, because of. To be on the baby Jesus. That we. We realize that there's beauty in everyone and it's all. It's all right. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. He's never had that before. No. Well, I am. I have to say, I'm really getting into the Christmas spirit. When I was younger, I didn't really enjoy. I was quite cynical, but. But now I'm sort of. Yeah. I walk in a department store and if there's one of the old, you know, chestnuts are roasting on an open fire, which. That classic T, or any of them. Those old boys that stand outside the. British Museum, you know that one. Or is it. How does it go? Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, Chestnuts. Roasting on Jack Frost. Nothing it knows. But I can't get enough of them. I love. I'm in the department store, you know, it's frosty outside. You know, it's warm in there. Have you ever roasted your chestnuts on an open fire? I have never done that, no. Imagine that, just backing up to it like that with your little chestnuts hanging out like a bulldog. What would you be wearing? Probably just. I imagine you'd have your dressing gown on. You've just hooked it up. Just pull it, pop them. Pop them down. Like. Tuck it in like a lovely lady. Yeah, so like a lovely lady from the front, but behind it looks like a, you know, a real. A bulldog dragging a tree. Yeah. And. And you just pop that. You pop them in the grate. Yeah, yeah. And you would, because you want to be careful of too much roasting. So I imagine you'd want to just kind of ease yourself in. Slowly, lightly toast them, and if it feels too hot, get out of there. Get the hell out of there. Yeah. You know, that's if any kids Are listening. Try that. No. What? No, like there's a kid thinking, yeah, I'm gonna roast my chestnuts on an open fire. I don't want someone to do it. And then the parents go, and Steve Merchants told our children to do it. We're probably getting. Ah, we're probably in trouble. Where's the kid gonna find an open fire like this? I mean, it has to be the sort that they use those kind of barrels. It can't just be open fire at home. That doesn't came. That's just stupid. If you can do it properly. Oh, no, we're having such a nice time there. We've lowered the tone. I'll tell you what'll prick us all up though. Richard Anderson has emailed us. Sticky Anderson. He's loving the show. Is he? Well, I don't know if you've heard this, Carl. Carl. I've called you Car. That's okay. I'm Claire. Pleased to meet you. It was the shaved head or the cup inside. Yeah, it was the K sound because didn't I call you Arthur or Jack. Or something last time he called me? I can't remember, I don't know, but it was quite embarrassing. I'll be honest with you. Claire's quite an unmemorable name. I know, I know, but yeah, Dickie Anderson, he's a guy. I'll be honest with you. He's not a big fan of the show, but he's. Well, we're getting into winning round. He says, dear Ricky, the more disappointing your show becomes, the more I seem to look forward to it. Now I see your face plastered across London. Is your show some sort of curse put on me by an old gypsy woman I've annoyed, you know. Good point, Dicky, but, but Randers, as I call it. Yeah, yeah, listen, now, I know what he's doing. Yeah, he's tucked him in. He's backing into the fire as we speak and he wants it. He wants to roast them till they spit. Oh dear. Oh, thanks for. Thanks for listening. Thanks for. Merry Christmas to you. And as you know, you got a lot to look forward to because our first hour is always the best. You're gonna be loving it till 3. Cockers. Oh, dear. Watch me play. Well, this is. I, I every so often I get sent a CD by a friend of mine, Harry, who just sorts me out with tunes that I may have missed. It is a great idea and this is one that I think it came out this year. It's a teenage fan club and they teamed up with Jad Fair. And I think it's a mixed bag, the album, apparently. But this is one of the good tunes near to you. I'm afraid your CD isn't working. Oh, no, it is now. No, no. Oh, it's not me. Steve. Honestly keeps stuck. Looks like it's you. No, honestly, you're pressing buttons, you're fiddling with buttons. No, no, look. Comes back again. Look. Right, you can't play that. Look, I can't. I just. I. This never happens when Kyle's here. It does, it does. You're right. Yeah. Yeah. I tell you gonna do. I'm gonna. I'll swap it into another CD machine. Can we play Oasis? It's one of another. One of my favorites. Oasis back on form. Yeah. Rick, I don't. I'm not discrediting the tune. I just feel like it was a good hour. It was a good hour of radio and it's just been cheap. You're right. It's just gone 2:00 and already started to fall apart. Well, this is. This doesn't bode well for the comedy awards. This is. This is a good anthem. This is a good Brit pop anthem. Older old Noel back on form with the old singer songwriting. This is Little by Little and Oasis. He's a giant. He's like a giant and he's a giant. And he gets. Starts off little and gets bigger little. By little by little. Bit bigger by bigger. I called it. Yeah, well. Yeah, well, that's what makes you so genius. Yeah. Oasis. Little by little. Little by little. Great tune. I'm looking to as. No, I'm Steve merchant and he's XFM 104.9. Yeah. And playing the great sky. Oh. Channel 864. But Ricky, people are saying they can't see on the webcam. You just stick a leg up or something just so they. That. Yeah, yeah. Was it just on you? Is it. Oh, because most. But they can't see me because I'm in camouflage. It's not a very interesting picture. Does anyone log on online? I don't know who. How does the webcam look? I don't. I've not ever seen on a webcam. Is it just kind of. Because normally aren't they kind of really sort of jarring? Does it take pictures like a digital camera? It's every 15 seconds. Seconds. It updates. You get a still picture. Is it Right? I see. Okay. Oh, it. Still pictures. Is it? I didn't realize that. Yeah. Every 15 seconds. Yeah. So they can't actually see you Know, like, if I was to bust some amazing dance moves. No, they would just see if you did it. If you did it every 15 seconds, like, you move. They could then print them off and do, like a flicker book so they could see. Amazing. They can see doing windmills and, you know, King Tuts. Yeah, all that, all that. All that scissor kick. I'm running out of steam now, Steve. Bit tired, are you? So I've got 50 minutes to do, so we better think. Think there's something to say. Well, I was. I genuinely was going to ask you because obviously Christmas is approaching and I've not even started to think about Christmas gifts. I don't know how you're getting on. I never do. You're aware of what Ricky bought his family last year, aren't you? Oh, yeah. Do you know? I am because he told me and I've completely forgotten. It's extraordinary. It is extraordinary. I mean, how much thought do you. How much thought? Right, right. I was pressing how many parents, how many kids were there? How many people were there? This is. This is it. This is it. I've got a big family. Okay. Well, not big, but I mean, they've got lots of kids. So I'm sort of youngest in my siblings. And so they're, you know, they've got kids ranging from like 30 to. To babies. And there's about 15 of them. All my. And you buy them all? Yeah, I'll try and get them. Try and get. Nice. So what is it? Wait. So I got a lift up, down, and I thought, oh, what can I get? I thought, oh, I can't just give him the money. I'll stop you there straight away, if I may. You notice he's on the way down for Christmas Day. All right. So he's on the. Oh, right. He's on the way down. This is when he starts. This is when he starts. Oh, Boxing Day. So this is when he starts to think about buying them a gift. Yeah. On you go. So I was getting a lift and lift down. So just before we got there, I just ran across the road to the. The 7 11. Got 200 quids worth of scratch cards. Scratch cards? Scratch cards. Bear in mind, I think you were describing the family. Then I noticed some of them you described as babies. Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, yeah. So children. You're giving the children the gambling. The gambling cards. But that's lovely. They gave them 10 each, so they could have won thousands of pounds. A lot of them were disappointed when they won nothing. But I said, kids, that's the gamble. That'S the risk you take when you receive a gift from me. But the great thing about getting. The great thing about getting some of. Them one, some of them were laughing. But the great thing about getting kids hooked on gambling as a Christmas gift is it's the gift that keeps on giving. Yeah. Throughout your adult life. It gives and it takes. Exactly, yeah. I don't hand them to children, I handed them to parents. What they chose to do them, they can distribute as they want it. Sure, sure. So what you going to do this year, Ricky? How are you going to top that? 300 quid. Got a bit of money now, but. It'S the most thoughtless and the office pipey gift I've ever. I think they might be getting the office on dvd. Sign, sign. So that's already set it up in value. Oh dear. I know, that's pretty bad. So have you seriously considered it this year? No. I'm going to go shopping. I'm going to go shopping properly. Yeah. If you want any help, I am the queen. You take a small roulette wheel down there, wouldn't you? Genuinely. Didn't you buy like a roulette wheel? No, I had it. That's down there from when I got it when I was about 10. Oh, right. And sometime the banker. I always win. Yeah, of course, I gotta learn a lesson. The banker always wins. It's a valuable lesson when they, when they lose money to me. You should just go down this year and just say, basically, I went to a casino, I put a 10 pound chip on for everyone. Here's the wish. You lost, yours came in, yours was a donkey duck. But Steve, what about you then? Because, I mean, you don't like shopping. Well, it's not that I don't like shopping, it's that I don't. I've got no ideas. You know, I'm running on empty with my parents. They don't appear, as far as I can make out, they don't appear to have any hobbies. You don't like wasting money? I'm not being funny, but you don't like wasting money either, do you? Well, I don't like wasting money, no, but I like, I like to buy something practical for people. I like something that. Which is going to last. Something that's value for me. I don't like novelty gifts. I think novelty gifts are wrong. I've mentioned to you that my grandparents spend all their time in bed, so there's only so many kind of, you know, sort of bed socks, you can buy, you know, and ointment for, you know, bed blisters and so on before, you know, you run out of ideas. What about some of those novelty tickets teeth. Because that. I mean because that would be, you know, a nice jokey present and they could probably come in useful for chewing the broccoli. Yeah. Oh, do you know what? Be nice one of those. I'll tell you when. No, they sort of travel pillows. So you know when you're traveling and. And your head sort of falling down. They travel from vertical to almost horizontal. They're sitting up in their bed. Get on one of them beds that come up. You're not made the money. Heard's bed. Thora Heard's bed. She's just earthy. Ever touch the ground now? Do you know what I mean though? No. She goes shopping in one of those little trolleys. She goes straight into her. She's up the stair lift. She gets lowered into the bath. Yeah, it's herbicus. I just lazy. I mean I'll tell you that. But I mean there's a whole like. Yeah, if you're in the kind of money that, you know that herd is on, you know with her. With her under the same money for old. She's the comedy awards last year, wasn't she? Well, she. I'll give her an award. She's up the stairs like the ground. She can move then. But so I've got no ideas. Absolutely no ideas. Okay, but so any suggestions are welcome. Claire, what are you gonna get your family? You've already. Well, I know I've. Well obviously can't tell you because they will be listening but they're all outside at the moment because my family are coming to meet me after the show and we're gonna swap presents then because. Okay, outside. Are there any offices? No, I haven't. No. Because I should. I should point out that the Office DVD is currently available. I actually did go and buy. I actually went and bought it myself and I am enjoying the scripts by. By the way. Excellent. That's in. I love the fact that we're authors in the top 10. Yeah, we're in the top 10 best seller list. No, no, no, but to be fair, we're in the. We're in. We're at number seven in the paperback non fiction Now I don't understand how that can be non fiction. Yeah, because it's the transcript from a made up. It's not a real documentary. Exactly. Yeah but we. We're. We're beating these poor people. But we're officially best Selling authors. I think that's fantastic. Which is excellent. My favorite bits. My favorite bits are the emails at are. They are. I mean, a lot of people don't know what you're talking about, Claire, but of course, if they pop down to Waterstones or Books etc, they can. They can sort themselves out. Nice. I like your style. Can we have some more music now? Let's have Streets. I mean, street is obviously one of the albums of the year. And this year, this is Weak. Becoming Heroes, I think the last single. And Dynamite it is too. The street. Nothing but gray concrete and dead beats. Eric Sermon and what's the tune called there? It's called React. From his debut. No, not his fourth solo album. Not bad, not bad, not bad. I'm enjoying the tunes. No, absolutely. I'm enjoying the tunes. I'm enjoying the penultimate show before Christmas. Last message from Anders, I suspect for the day. He says, I've just roasted my chestnuts over an open fire. It's a lot more enjoyable than listening to your show. He's pretty snappy. He's. Anders, you know, he keeps on coming. You know, it's a shame that, you know, that we sort of couldn't sort of maybe meet up with him and try and persuade him that, you know, he should come over to our side rather than, you know, come over to the side. Exactly, exactly. Come over to this side. I think we've got him, though, because, yeah, apparently they did this survey in. In America. People who loved Howard Stern listened to an average of like an hour and a half a week, and people who hated him listened two and a half hours. Week. Yeah, exactly. So I think he's probably more faithful a listener. Yes. Than some of the people that quite like us. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I mean, he's got to listen. It's. I'm the same with some people. I got to listen to things that I just think are awful. I can't. You know, it's compulsive viewing. So, you know, I don't care if people listen to us because they hate us or like. No, indeed. As long as they're listening. Actually, I was on the. As long as they're spending money on the advertising. Yeah. I was on the tube the other day, and obviously there's lots of pictures of you guys and as a young couple, and the guy was trying to explain to the girl what. What you did, and he said, no, you should check them out. That they do quite well, actually. Really? That's very sweet. Why was he explaining to her? She just didn't she didn't know what was happening or. I don't know. I, I sort of. As I walked by them. Are you leaving out the fact she went, oh, I hate that bloke? No, no, not at all. No, no, because I would say that. Because that would be quite. He had some Germans laughing at him on the tube because he recognized him. Oh yeah, I think of that. Well, obviously Ricky doesn't travel on the tube anymore. He's too rich for that. I never did. I always thought it was beneath me. Sure. But I used to walk everywhere. Yeah, but I'm still forced to. I'm still forced to take the tube and sat on the tube and it pulled up and outside the window just happened to be on the station was one of the posters with us. So I was kind of there, not realizing it was behind me and these big kind of fat German or maybe Bavarian guys. Ladyhosen eating sausages. Yes, they were. Yeah, they were. And, and I noticed one of them kind of looked at me, then looked at the poster, then looked at me, just, just happened to see it and whittered something to his friend in German. You know, I don't want to try and do an impression. I think that. No, no, no, no. I know what you're thinking. It means. It doesn't mean that. Right, okay. What's a rough translation? Elegant boy. Right, okay. Yeah. And so anyway, he pointed. Goggle eye. He pointed out the poster and that's lanky pissing streak. And his mate burst into laughing after. And. And then we put. I've got a great sense of humor. The German thing. But we rumbled on to the next. We rumbled on to the next station and the post was in exactly the same place. And this time they tapped the shoulder of someone else on the train and pointed me out. And that person also an Italian. Yeah, there was a French. Was everybody with a bare head, a little mustache on the other side? Yeah. Was it united? Did you get on the United nations express? Just. Oh, imagine that it was. It was freak. Look at this freaky goggle eye. Right, where is. I love the fact that before you were at least pretending to be speaking German. Now this is an Italian with an accent. It's just a guy speaking perfectly good English. So you've not even disguised the insult there. Oh dear. That be another. You could bring Europe together if they just. Instead of Esperanto, there was just one common language. The language. I'll tell you what would bring the European together is you maybe representing England on the Eurovision Song Contest. That would Be great with a self pen tune. Should I do that? That would be magnificent. It's got to be worth thinking just. About everyone being the same. Yeah, everyone. And. But and also mentioning the euro. Yeah, yeah, just doing that. I like all different. I like all different cheeses. Oh. J Lab music pop. Yeah. Le baby bell. I'm not a fluent French. Grand fromage. Yeah. I'll be lovely, won't it? And they'll there all in a different. Well, every line could be maybe in a different language. Yeah. And what would I wear? I'd wear sort of like a kilt. But you'd also have on your head one of those. Those kind of big. What are they called? Those big furry hats that beef eaters. Or whatever wear one of them. Is it kind of a busby or something? A busby wear one of those and. Or maybe a policeman's helmet. Bobby's helmet with the kids kilt. Yeah, he'd have the clocks. I'd wear the policeman's helmet under the kilts. They just thought I was really enjoying the show. Yeah, yeah. Good idea. Hey, excellent. We talk. Well, I think we talked for about three minutes without having to mention some kind of genitalia. We should celebrate by playing one of my tunes of the year. Really? What one is it you two elect? I know you're a big fan. I know you're a good choice. Well done. Cheers. Electrical storm, you two. I think that's my favorite of the year. If I had to pick one, that's great. And I do still feel slightly guilty about dissing them throughout the 90s. But you know, don't feel guilty if you didn't like the stuff. I didn't like 90 stuff. I'm loving what they're doing. I think you're a bigger man than them, frankly, for being able to admit your past mistakes. I think you're better than Bono, despite all his charity work. You're more of a noble figure. Stop bothering the Pope. He's busy. Exactly. Rick. My mother always used to say to me that you should write and thank your aunties and so on for their gifts. And I feel like we should take a moment out just to thank all the people that have emailed or written into us during the year because we don't basically we're very lazy men and we never reply. Well, I never look. You never look at anything. Very occasionally you're like my secretary when it comes. You protect me from like people who. Insults and so on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Are there any insults? Oh, there's plenty there's plenty. Yeah, yeah. Do you have to protect him, really? Oh, God, yeah. There's lots of things I don't tell him. It's not very nice. Well, he's not as popular as he thinks he is. Oh, he thinks that when he's like dancing around and making funny faces and squawking and making noises and stuff when we're filming, he thinks that everyone thinks that's enjoyable. What, people think I'm quite as annoying little Pratt, do they? That's not the word they use, but you're near enough there. Yeah, yeah. They didn't say Pratt, but you're on the right line. Okay. But for instance, we had an email here from Graham. He says, please stop the chat and let's hear some more great ads as I'm still not sure what mobile phone I should get the wife for Christmas. Well, maybe this will help you out. Just having fun with the webcam. Sorry? Yeah, we're just playing with the webcam. The webcam. Absolute treat. That's a lovely picture there of Steve on. That's lovely. Right. Keep the ladies happy. That was feeder, if I know them. Great. Yeah. No, that's one of my favorite tracks of the year as well, which is what we're doing. God, it's gone quickly. It's only quarter of an hour ago. Yes, indeed. Yes. Carl will be back next week for our kind of Christmas bonanza. I say that we've got nothing planned. There's no reason why it should be a bonanza. That'll be nice. Yeah. So we'll play some Christmas tunes and no doubt Carl will have some kind of festive game for us maybe. Or a festive. A couple of new games. I mean, he's. He's struggling with Rockbusters, which we've missed this week. Week. Educating Ricky. He thinks there's nothing out there. All he could find was a parrot and a dog in a car wash. Yeah, you can't find any more interesting. Still a little bit upset that we told him about intelligent crabs and babies forcing their way out. Yeah. We stitched him up last week by telling him some. Some what we claimed were facts. All right. Because I was out shopping, so I missed it. Yeah, well, you know. Well, you know, he believes anything that's weird and wonderful. We just made up this story. So. Made up, I said two bodybuilders got married and she had a baby. But it. After six. Six months or seven months, she was in bed asleep and she woke up with terrible agony where the baby. Where it born. A bodybuilder had forced its way out of the vagina, was pulling her along by the umbilical cord. Yeah. And. And intelligent crabs and stuff like this. And he was genuinely disappointed. Yeah. That they were. But he got a new idea. I'm gonna. What I'm gonna do is tell him three things. Yeah. One of which is made up and ludicrous. And two incredible facts. Facts. And it's called that's Rick Ridiculous. Brilliant. So he has to go number three is Ricky Diculous. It's a winner. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Carlos comes up with a title first. You don't have to work the game show out from the title. Have you started work on that's Ricky Dickulous yet? No, I've thought of a couple of things. It is great. It's so much fun to say, isn't it? Ricky Dickulous. Yeah, that's Ricky Diculous. You're correct. Basically, it's like call my bluff, isn't it really? Unlike Cormobuff. It's not unlike bluff. It's not like bluff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, yeah, we've had Oasis streets, we've had YouTube. We had some cracking tunes. Can we get away with playing Nelly Hot in here? I think it's a cracking tune. I really do. I just think again, you know, I'm not interested in what genre you think it fits into or whether you think it's cool or because kids like it. You're not supposed to like it. That's a good tune. And I think we should try to get. But before that, Rick, can I just play one track we did play much earlier in the year? It's from that album Son of Evil Reindeer by a band called the Reindeer India section. And this is a cracking little tune. I just think it's beautiful and nice to hear it. Oh, beautiful Marriott, then. Ah, nice, isn't it? Yeah, Christmassy. It makes me want to wish everyone a happy Christmas. Indeed. Yeah. Do it. No, no. Okay. That's called Grand Parade from the album Son of Evil Reindeer by the reindeer section. It's. Nice tune. It's one of my favorites of the. Year, by the way. Not at all. No, that's. That's my pleasure. It's my pleas, Claire, just big highlights of the year for you as a final roundup sort of things. Have you enjoyed this year? I mean, musically maybe, or maybe stuff, you know. I've enjoyed that band. The music. Okay. And the rapture. Sure. And at the Electric Six. Remember last time I sat in for car, we played Danger Danger High Voltage. Yeah. One of the first. That was the first time I've heard it. Now we're playing it every hour. Because you're sort of a pioneer, aren't you, musically on xfm? You're one of the people who keeps it pretty raw. Ricky, do you remember the early days of the World? I'll take that back as well. Teasing you about them playing the Pin Wakefield stuff that. That latest single I love. And the video is great as well. I'm a big fan of Idle World now. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, it's been a good year. I haven't been out to many gigs, obviously, because I do the evening show, but, you know, all the sessions, which I'm doing the best of next week. Quick plug for the show. Next week. Best of the Sessions. So it's low points, low points, Low points. Do you know what mine are? What? Poverty and war and I always hate it. No, you know you didn't say that. Yeah, no, you. You were going to say. I was going to say. No, you were going to say the Streets or something and I. And you didn't care about the people dying, so don't try. And I'm thinking specifically, you're nasty. You like that. You like poverty. Oh, you like poverty in salvation. Play a record. That's interesting. That's interesting. Near Christmas time. What a horrible. You. You hope kids go lame. Terrible. That's terrible. Things so hot. Yeah. Nelly. Cheeky little bit of Nelly. There's a great deal. Do you do usually? No, indeed. We don't live by the rules, Stu. Absolutely. I was just. As I was listening to you then talk. You got bored? No, no. It reminded me of an email that someone sent in saying that they listen online, but because of however slow their computer is, whatever they. It kind of stutters all the way through. Point out that is the way I said. No. But they said it only happens when you talk and I think they've correctly identified that it's not the computer at fault. Well, that's what you do in this. Boxing match because I've definitely lost my looks and I already slur. Yes. So there was really no danger of any damage. No, exactly. Yeah. You do. Saying punch drunk constantly. Exactly. It's just part of your charm. Well, listen, that's been a lovely two hours for me. I've enjoyed it. The listeners have enjoyed it. I hope you've enjoyed it. I hope Sturgis has enjoyed it. I've enjoyed it. Enjoyed it. Yeah. Well, I didn't really care. Don't bite him when I'm talking to Steve. Yeah. You know you need to press the buttons, but we're gonna play now a Christmas song for the lovely Christmas ladies. I don't say it's so much Christmassy, but it's one of the tunes I heard this year that really. Well, you're a fool. You've embarrassed yourself. You just showed up that there's no planning. This is. I was given away on a free CD on cover of a magazine. I just think it's brilliant. It's a Lamb Chop. Who are an excellent band. Always doing a cover of an obscure Rolling Stones tune. Bloody good meal as well. True enough. So we'll leave them with this. It's Backstreet Girl, Lamb Chop. And see you next week for our final festive show. Yeah. Thanks very much. Embarrassing. It's something embarrassing. Thank you. I don't want you to be.",
