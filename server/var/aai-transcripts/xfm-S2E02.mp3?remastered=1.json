With us, the producer in the studio is a Carl Pilton and he'll be doing this buttons. Yeah, you made a good effort there, but once again you've got bored words. Your enemy and they defeated you once again. Yes. Run out of steam with the sentences. Every week I think, well, I'm really gonna make an effort now. I'm gonna. I've chosen some records. Yeah, that's it. That's it. That's as far as it goes, isn't it? Yeah. Maybe you should write out what you're going to say at the top of the show. Write that out. I like to keep a little bit of, you know, a little bit of. Something, a little bit spark, a little bit of liveliness to it. Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. How are you? Good to see you. Good, yeah, it's great, it's great to. It's great to be out of the house again. Yeah. Oh, yeah, just. I was going to say because we've been doing this for a long time now with a little break, but XFM are bringing new listeners all the time. I've heard four or five a week. Really? Yeah. New listeners. Tune in to XFM1 radio point nine. Beware. Yeah, yeah. And we might take it for granted, the people that know who we are, know who you are, know who Carl is. Sure. Now if, if you, you know, if you're a regular, then you know exactly who we are. But for those of you who don't, I say I'm. I'm Ricky Gervais. Ricky Jaft, award winning actor and writer. Steve Merchant. All those friend of yours. Yeah, yeah. And this is the important thing. Carl Pilkington. Absolutely. Our producer. I say producer. He was the bloke who was lumbered with a job when. Listen, I see I used to run the desk in the old days. I used to press the buttons and run the desk and everything. And now I said, listen, I've been on the telly, I do not press my own buttons. And Carl said, well, I don't really work weekends. And I went, well, you do if you want to keep your job. Absolutely. And we were lumbered with him and then we discovered that he's not just a little like a little dork, a little manky sort of idiot. He's got, he's got nice shirt, he's got, you know, I mean he's got something else. He brings another dimension. Yeah, yeah. And he, he started a little chat and we discovered that he had quite a lot to say. Well, I, I think actually. Right. And I think I was wondering maybe we should maybe play another tune. But after that I just think we should re familiarize our radio audience with Carl and any new listeners just get, you know, somehow kind of let them get to know the real Carl again. Well, if you are new you'll find that we like some old songs. Some new songs, some chit chat. We get serious sometimes. There's some tears and some laughter. We kicked off with the wax, this new one little by little. We're going to go back in time now to Iggy Pop and his Stooges with I'm Iggy Pop on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. Steve Merchant here. Yeah. Little Carl Pilkington. Well, to reintroduce or introduce people for the first time to Carl, I think we should have a. Yeah, maybe sort. Of a kind of a quick Q and A, Carl. And we don't need sort of lengthy answers from you. We don't need lots of detail, you know, can we just a couple of sentences just to get who you are. Yeah. So firstly a name obviously. Carl Pilkington. Age? Carl. I'll be, I'll be 30 next month. Really? This month? No, next. Where are we? I don't think we need to ask any more questions. That's it. Welcome to the world of Carl Cottage, I think. Oh, I thought it would take three or four questions. I thought it was gonna be at least to really explain. That was the first question. Oh, oh absolutely. But you know, we can't really leave it there because we haven't got enough else to do to fill up the two hours. So let' pursue this line of inquiry. Yeah. So age, what was the age, Carl, in a couple months, when were you born? I'll be 72. Right. What month? What day? I'm on the cusp. You're on the cusp of the day? Well, 23rd of September. Okay. 72. So anyway. Okay, right, good. I know you were talking there about obviously a star sign where you're on the cusp. Yeah. You believe in that, do you? No. You don't believe in star signs? No, not really. But you do believe in ghosts, I understand. No, because paranormal. Yeah, but the star sign thing, you've got how many, how many different star signs are they? 12 in it. Right. And then you got like loads of. People yeah, you do the math. So they're saying that, you know, there's only 12 different sorts of people in the world. Exactly. That's exactly right. It's. It's made up. It's made up nonsense. It's non science, it's pseudo science. It's. Yes, it's. It's. It's. It's hairy man and dyed hair woman science. Yes. Annette. All right. Yeah. Anyway, back to you, Carl. Where were you born in. In Manchester. Okay. What GCSE results did you get? I got. Was that an E in history? And how did you find out that information? You found out because you thought you. You didn't. You couldn't remember what you got. You didn't turn up and you thought you'd done about three, one of which wasn't history. And actually, yeah, you didn't. I'm telling you didn't because we checked. You did one, you turned up for history. You did history. You got any? I definitely did. Art, I made a little claim on. Yeah. You've got a register for O levels. You don't just do it and then phone up and say, how was that? And I go, I'm sending you a clay man. Yeah, it's all thing. There's forms to fit out and things like that, Carl. Anyway, who was your closest childhood friend? Closest? What age? Well, when you were young. When you were young. I remember this. It's a fella. So is it someone making in it? There's. Well, he wasn't really a close mate. Darren Buckley was. Me. Darren Buckley? Yeah. Tell us briefly about Darren. I've forgotten about Darren. He's the one who. All the girls liked him. He had permedaire. He said I was there. Like a footballer. Sure. Were you jealous of him? It was a copper. Did you hang around with Darren, like in the hope of getting maybe his kind of cast offs? Nah, it's weird with me. And I wasn't that bothered about having loads of mates and that. I sort of. I had lots of mates, but I could do without them. You had a magpie, didn't you? I was happy playing with me magpie. Yeah. What happened to him? Flew away. Yep. But I wasn't bothered because it was giving me grief towards the end, wasn't. Was popping me grifter tires and that. Yeah, sure. Flying down, pecking me head. Sure. Now, you went to school with a number of different interesting people, some of. Whom were freaks, I understand, had big heads and webbed toes, is that right? Yet they were not related to each other and they Weren't friends with each other? Why weren't they friends with each other? Because that'd be obvious. Did they wear shoes or did they walk around in their. In their web toes? Were they good at swimming? Were they good at swimming? I don't know. I don't think they ever, ever went swimming. Did they ever talk? Did they ever look over at each other and think, yeah, we should hang out more? I told you something in the week as well. There's another lad at school at a pigeon chest. Can we come back to this? He had a pigeon chest. I think we should play a record, Carl, because I think we've hooked them now. I think there's no one switching off now, Rick. No. Play a record. Blur, Coffee and tv, Carl. I said it's not the best Blur song when it was playing. You know, I don't want to diss it, but, you know, it's not the best one. I mean, that's. That's fact. Sure, you know. Car went like the video, though. A little milk carton. Y Bit sad. It's tragic. Is it? He went, and this is all to himself. I'm not even joining in. And then he went, yeah, but it's all right. At the end, he goes to me, finds a little girl, milk carton just lives out a little thing. And is. Is that like you on your paper around that little milk carton walking around like that? I imagine you. Oh, people don't know about. If you just tuned in. Carl had a paper round. It's his favorite job ever and he maintains it's the best job he's ever had. And it's Carl, go on. I don't know what's so weird about that. It's a paper round. Yeah, but look, forget the most fulfilling. Look at. Look at the way it works, right? You. You get out of the way at the start of the day, so you've got the rest of the day to yourself. Same as signing on your own, your own boss, you know, Same as signing on. Well, you're not your own boss. The guy at the news agency. Yeah, yeah. That'S great. You've proven me wrong there. Yeah. Yeah, that's great. N. Yeah. Nah, not really. Would that stand up in court where you were found with the dagger? Nah. Was I. When are we. When are we playing the new game? Oh, Carl's got a new game. Carl's very excited. I was just talking about something before. Yeah. The freaks used to go, you had people with big heads, two red feet, didn't hang around each other. That would be too obvious. You had a fellow with a pigeon chest. Yeah. What's the story with the pigeon chest? Don't know how it happened. It was like it looked like somebody sort of hit him on the back with a big hammer. And it had come out at the front. Yeah. And I've never seen it since. Could that have been the answer? Well, why is. Why he had it. Why had it possibly, I suppose, in your neck of the woods. Yeah. Don't know. Never asked him. It's just come back to haunt you, has it? The pigeon chest? No, it's just that, you know, when you, when you mention about kids at school. I forgot all about him. He's talking about the kids with the web feet and the big heads. Yeah. And I forgot about the little old pigeon boy. Yeah. Pigeon, yeah. Well, listen, are you. I'm a big fan of that TV show. It's on digital tv. A lot of people won't have it, but inside the Actor's Studio with James Lipton. Yeah. And he interviews lots of big Hollywood stars and he always asks them these same questions at the end. Can I just run a few of them past you? Go on. Okay, so if you could do any other profession other than the one you do now, what profession would you do? Can you just change that to Apart from a paper round? Apart from a paper round you do any other profession, Carl. And it doesn't matter about like. Doesn't matter if you've got the skills or anything. In an ideal world, if you had the ability. Well, I think I'm about to buy somewhere so I reckon something, you know, using, using tools and like doing a bit of plumbing and that. So a plumber. Well, sort of an all rounder. Right, right. A handyman. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think, you know, you don't get paid that much but it's useful, innit? So you'd get your own show, couldn't you? With Carol Smiley, eventually. Well, all that, but the money that you don't make, you save by not having to pay someone else to do the chores, right? I can't. I don't know what that sentence meant. Right, right. No, a plumber. How much. How much is the average plumber on. The money you don't make you save on not getting someone else to do it. Now just think of that. No, look, break that sentence down. Are there any. Sorry, Rick, sorry, but people who live in glass houses. Anyway, let's just go back to Lipton quickly. We've got a couple of to get through here. So your, your Your. Your favorite noise or sound? Favorite sound or noise? Oh, is it me? No, it's not me. It's not me. Are you sure? It's not me, Carl. Noise. Elvis. Elvis in the Ghetto. The sound of Elvis. Elvis in the Ghetto. Brilliant. And your least favorite noise or sound? I don't think it should really be records and music. Noises, Things that you hear at home or whatever. Maybe like a sound of a. The least favorite noise. Least favorite. The sound of probably like sound of ghosts, fire engines and that. Right, That's. That's annoying. Except if your house was on fire, presumably. I think it's a bit unnecessary. You think they're just doing it to wind people up. I live on like a busy street and it's happening all the time. And it's. It is like just sort of have a blast of it and people will hear it. You have to keep it going. Sure, sure. So that. That is. Yeah. And if heaven exists, Carl, when you get to the pearly gates, what would you like God to say to you as he welcomes you into heaven? What would you like God to say to you? Who asks these. What shows this? It's a program where celebrities are interviewed by a guy, an American interviewer, and he always asks these questions at the very end. What would I say to God? What would you say to God if you believed in heaven and if heaven exists, when you eventually go up to heaven and you're welcomed in through the. Gates and you, Parker, in your stussy T shirt and your. What do you want God to say to you as he welcomes you in? Say. All right, don't know, just be. Just be friendly. That's the reindeer section. Beautiful. Yeah, Nice stuff. It's a kind of Scottish supergroup. Lots of different artists from Scottish. Sebastian, is it any singer from them? It may well be, yeah. On that particular track, different people. Mole Historical Society, Idlewild Teenage Fan Club. Different people from all those bands get together with a guy called Sir Gary Lightbody from Snow Patrol. And he writes and all that on XFM 104.9. Steve. Absolutely. Let me just name that track. That track was Grand Parade from their current album, Son of Evil Reindeer. Feeder. Come back around on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais, but who are you? Oh, thanks for asking, Rick. Steve Merchant with us. Carl Pilgerton. Well, well, Carl. Now, I know I shouldn't, but I met Carl in the week. I told you you shouldn't do that. But then we start. He starts saying things like, oh, is this love with the people. I gotta save it, save it. And we just sit there and I'm scared to talk in case he comes up. But you did tell me a couple little things, didn't you? True stories that, you know, that I mean, I enjoy. Can you tell Steven about the doctor? Right. Oh, God. What's. Is this something that happened to a friend of yours, or is this. No, no, I read about it. You read about it. Okay, there's this little lad. All right. Okay, first of all, it's years ago, right? They didn't have decent doctors in, like, every town and that. Yeah. And this little kid is dead ill, right? Yeah. And the local doctor, well, there's a phone call involved. So I don't really have the impression that it's like medieval times. Yeah, yeah, but I didn't say that. I just said it's years ago. So this kid's ill, right? Yeah. And he's. He's lying in the bed and he's all, like, all going funny color and that. Yeah. And. And his mom says, I'm gonna get the local doctor around. The local doctor comes around and says, oh, so they know. Don't know what's up with him. He said to leave it with me. Yeah. He said, I'll. I'll phone up a top doctor, okay. Who was in America or something like that. And so he goes to the phone in his office and he calls America. And because it's years ago, the phone line isn't that good. It's all crackly and that, Right. So he's talking to the doctor and he's saying, I've got this kid. He's a funny color and, you know, he's really weak and that. I don't know, he's not giving him much to go on, right? Sure. So the American doctor, right? Yeah. He goes, yeah, what you want to do? And it's all breaking up, right? Because what you gotta do, you go, it's all breaking up. You've got to give him some parrot's blood, right? Some parrots blood. Well, that's what he thought he said. But the line was really bad. He meant parents blood. But he heard that. He said parrot's blood, he said, right, I'll do that. Leave it with me. I can see where this is going. He goes. Goes to, you know, a pet shop. He says, give us like half a dozen parrots. Sure. Takes them around to the kid's house, takes the blood from the parrots, puts it into the kid. Kid's fine. The kid's Fine. I've never. It worked such a load of shite in my life. I've never had such twaddle, such just made up, enhanced, exaggerated. I mean when he told me this, he said, the doctor said, what do I do? And the doctor on the other end said, give him some blood. And the doctor went, where do I get blood from? So hang on, wait, I just need. To get blood from, from his parents blood. Give him some parents blood. Give him some parents and some parents blood. Yeah. But hang on, I just need to know where you were. Where was this? Where I stitched you up. You know what he said? He said, so do you believe that? I went, tell it to Steve. He went, do you believe it? I went, tell it to Steve. Carl, that was on the Internet. What about illnesses? I'm always looking at stuff. I was looking at stuff this morning because of, because of your agela last night, eating, eating all that funny food and that. And also they all got a bit scared last night, didn't they, with a, with a snake. I didn't see that. So is this I'm a celebrity, get me out. Yeah, yeah. I got all worried about a snake getting on the sort of wandering about in between the sleeping bags and stuff. Yeah. And they were all scared and he. Said, leave it with me. Sorry, the doctor says, leave it with me. Yeah, leave it with me. Well, they were all scared because there's a snake and it's so easy to find stuff out before they, before they. Where are they? Where is this jungle? Australia? Went, give it half an hour on the Internet. I found out with snakes you don't need to worry. Right. The deaf, they haven't got any ears. Right. So as long as you, you're really quiet, they'll probably leave you alone. Yep. And also they don't have eyelids, so they were suggesting if one's coming towards you, just like kick sand in its eyes because it can't blink and it leaves it a bit like annoyed and it wanders off. But they didn't do any research before they went. Yeah, I think your knowledge would hold you in good stead. I don't think you need to know any more than you know. Well, we're gonna come back to that because he also explained to me where I'm a saying comes from that I want you to be part of. But. Oh, and also he should mention as well, Carl, you've come up with a competition. Is this right? Brilliant competition. He thinks this can go to television. Is this an idea you've come up with? Yeah, Carl, I'm so looking forward to it. I mean, I'm. I'm looking forward to it. I'm continuing our exposure of myths and. And legends of ox towel. We expose that myth that some maybe older rockers have had it and they've gotten that they were never any good. And the kids today, people like Rod Stewart. Rod Stewart, he's a great artist, this. He's a slightly laughable man, but a great artist. Let's go back to when it was. When he was rocking, when he cut the mustard. Yeah. Rod Stewart. You wear it well. Great shoe on XFM 104.9. Yeah. This doctor, I mean, we should find out who he is, really, and if he's still practicing. Because it. It worries me a little bit that, you know, he did that also. I mean, he thinks he's got away with it, but how could he be sure those parrots wouldn't talk. True, true. You know what I mean? There were six of them. They probably got together and they. They probably put it on the Internet. I mean, I. I feel that that story, Carl, it asks more questions than it answers. Yeah, really, like most of your stories. Yeah, that's the problem. I always. For them, I always feel like I need a little bit more information. Like, did the parrot boy continue to live. Yeah. You know, to a ripe old age, or did he die weeks later after this charlatan doctor who was going around, you know, spirit. Did he break his nose trying to crack a big nut? No, I think he's. He was all right. He lived to a. See, I just shouted. If I was that doctor, I'd have shouted that down the phone. Are you sure you said parrots blood? Yeah. You sure it was parrot's blood? Listen, I mean, you know, I'm not the best doctor in the world, but. Did you say parrots blood? Yeah, but what you're forgetting is you're going back to the time where like, like they used leeches to do, like. No, no, we're going back to the late 70s. If there's a phone call to America direct. Come on, Carl. They weren't calling America like in the medieval times or, or in the Victorian age. Come on, think about it, Carl. You know, this has got to be like the, the, like, you know, 30s or 40s, the earliest. You know. I'm intrigued to know where they say, I think there's someone on the, on the web who's just putting information on there to lead you astray. Yeah. Because you're. Who finds this stuff. Other people are using this to Write. Why are you looking up that then? What we what? I always look at weird stuff. What were you looking for? But what do you type in the search engine to find par stories? What were you looking for? Was this woman with a weird head. Why were you looking for that? What were you doing? I heard about it. I heard like someone talking about on another station, right? About this woman with a. With a funny head. I love the fact, I love the fact you're intrigued with these things. You go in the basement of Waterstones or Dylan's or something somewhere and there's these, there's these medical books that you're loving. This is free on the Internet, isn't it? It's all there, yeah. So what you typed in weird head, woman or. Lady with head? Yeah, weird, weird, weird people or something? I put in, sure, yeah. Did you come up? 7,000 hits. Carl Covington. But it's all there, innit? It's interesting. The one that I was telling you before about. What's the name? The. The lost letter. The lost letter. The last, last postcard that's just turned up. Some woman sent a postcard years and years ago to, to a niece or something, right. And a niece was like 3 years old back then. And just now like I think like yesterday or the day before it turned up, the postcard turned up 74 years late. 74 years later took 74 years. And that three year old girl's been living in the same house that whole time. Well, yeah, sure. There's no way. There's always a question you can ask to just scratch the credibility of these stories. There's always. It's like the apocryphal town. Was this the slugs. Was this those slugs from last week? Yeah. Were they holding back because they're slow? Because the postman slug is useless. His round takes him 74 years, then he's got to go back to the beginning. He's got 74. And they can't carry the bag. That's. They go. That's where they turn to glue. That's why they turn to glue. Oh, it's pitiful. It is. So you don't believe that someone sent a postcard years ago and somehow it's been stuck in the bottom of a post bag or something and it's only. Just stuck at the bottom of a post bag. That means that there's like a 95 year old postman who's still wandering around. Did you, did you have to pay like the, the difference on the charges? Because presumably it wouldn't have had Queen Elizabeth. It was a penny Black, presumably, was it? Yeah. What would be on the stamp? It would have been invalid, surely? Because if it's the postman's fault, the Post Office can't turn off. He was only three at the time himself, wasn't he? He was dead. He is dead. Yeah. He'll be well and truly dead now. But the fact is that the Post Office made an error, right? They lost this letter. It's only just turned up. They can't turn around and say, sorry about this. I hope it isn't urgent. It's turned up 74 years late. And by the way, you owe us 25 pence. Yeah, yeah. They wouldn't do that. Wouldn't they? That's true. That's true. You're asking questions, ac. That's. That's true. You see. So you're interested in that, where stains come from as well, aren't you? Because you told me one of the week. What? That. I don't know if Steve's aware of that. Do you want to tell Steve this one? What's this? A saying. Can we do this quiz? We'll do the quiz. I know you're excited about the quiz. Let's do that later. But what's this saying? Right? What is the saying? Chucking a baby out with the bath water. Yeah. Have you heard that phrase? Don't throw the baby out with the bath water. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. How would you use that? Well, how would I use that? Don't throw the baby out the bath water. I suppose if you've. Maybe you've been discussing something, you've come up with some plans, but you're slightly worried and, you know, you might abandon the whole plan, whereas there might be some ideas in there which are still worth retaining. So you don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water. There might be something you can just change and you don't. Yeah. You know, there might be a few ideas you can salvage from an otherwise worthless one. Well, the saying, right, comes from, like years ago again and pre or post. Phone. Ages and ages ago when, like, you know, the bloke worked in the house, you know, he was like the coal man. And then you had like, it's important then. Then, like, the mom is like, you know, she stays at home making the dinner, looking after the kids. Yep. And. And you've got like the little kid who's just growing up, just messing about and stuff. So what happens is, back then they didn't have like fresh, flowing warm water. Every day. So all they could do, they could only afford to have like one. One full big bath of fresh water. So they'd fill up the bath, right. And then the dad would come home and he'd say, oh, I've had all right, you know, that tough day at work and that down the pit. And his wife would say, it's all right, I'm putting the dinner on. You're gonna have a nice warm bath. Because he gets to bath first. Because he gets the bath first. Because he's the grafter and he's covered in coal. He's covered in coal. So the water's like minging by the time he's finished. Yeah. Right. And then the wife says, oh, after all my cleaning the house and doing the cooking, I'm a bit sweating out. She's covered in dust. I'll have a bath. Right at the end of the line, there's a little baby. Yeah, it's been playing out all day. Also got like little, little grubby knees and stuff. Needs to have a bath. Yeah, it goes in the bath. Right. But because the water is so dirty. Sure. They go and empty the water out of the window. Can't see the baby in it. Chucking the baby out with the bath water. That's right. That's where it comes from. I don't know what the size thing, because I heard this. I just. I'm just. I'm just. What do you think, Steve? Steve? So. So firstly, that. That. That sort of. I mean, that doesn't explain. You're struggling, aren't you? You're struggling. Where to start? First, I can't see how we've now applied this to the example. I've been thinking of this for days, Steve, waiting for you to hear this one. These coal mining parents, deeply negligent. Yeah. They've left their babies in your bath unattended. That's the way around to do it. The one covered in coal. Yeah. You go first. You go first. Don't wash the baby and then get in that one. Covered in coal goes first. That's the best idea. Second most dirty one goes second. And then the clean little baby. I think we should do him last because he's done nothing towards this family. But more than that, Rick, leave him to his own devices. Jack, I'm just gonna throw the water out in the bath. Don't check. Have you checked that the baby's gone? No. I'm not even gonna waste my time checking. You see it? I'd be able to see a baby if a Baby was in here, I'd be able to see it. I'm just gonna throw it out. Yeah, I'm not even gonna look to be. Hon, if the baby's in there, then it should be making. We have lost three children this way. Don't worry. Where did you read that. New single from? Super grass Grace on XFM 104.9. Coming up in the next hour, Carl Pilton's new game show. He's very excited about. I'm excited. I'm excited. We don't know anything about it, but. He'S told me it's gonna be a winner. He's, you know, he said it's gonna go to television. Sure. I need some advert. Adverts, though. Oh, I'd love to hear some adverts. Can we have just two or three minutes of adverts, please? Vines there. Steve on XFM 104.91 with me, Steve Merchant, and Carl Pilkington. Carl's getting very excited, as we all are, about his new. Should we. Should we let him do a little taster for us? Well, I'm very excited about it. So the gist of it. What is it? What is it exactly? Is it a game show or is it a competition? It's just. Just thought it's something that, you know, you can play and also people at home can take part in it. Now, would they phone in about this or they can just play at home while they're listening? They can just play at home. Okay. You mean we haven't got any prizes? No, there isn't. No. I. I think we could get into phone in maybe. Well, I don't know. Let's hear the game idea first. Right. It's music related. Okay, good. And what I do is I sort of tell a little story. Okay. And that story makes up a song title. All right. Well, it sounds ambitious. So is it a cryptic clue? Could be. Say, say like this, right? Oh, deary me. Oh, deary me. Say like this. This woman, right, she's pregnant. You know the answer to this one. So don't be saying anything. This is just aimed at Steve, Okay, Right. This woman has a baby. Yeah. She's pregnant as a baby. And the doctor's there in the. In the hospital going, oh, yeah, you've got a lovely little baby. You told me that this is. Oh, this guy. A lovely little baby. It's just coming out now. You'll be able to see it in a minute. And it's like covered in gunk and stuff. Yeah. And he's going yeah. It's nearly here. It's coming out. See? See, it's a little head and that. And he gets hold of it and it's full of all this gunk. Right? The baby's full of gunk. Yeah. Like they are covered in gunk or full of gunk. Covered in it. Right. And he goes, here you go. Get all your baby. And he drops it. Right. What song's that? There's so much irrelevance there, Steve. I can't tell. It's not a cryptic clue. It's not a cryptic clue because only the gist of it is that isn't the best one. That's right. I mean, there is just. There's. There's things there that you would put. Dwelling on and thinking of puns. Don't just go for gut instinct. What was it? What was that? Let me just. I just need to try and get the basics of this as a woman. She's pregnant. She has a baby. Yeah. The baby's covered in gunk. Right. And because of the gunk, the doctor drops the baby. Yeah. That's all I need to know. Yeah. That is all you need to know. Yeah. The pregnancy is largely irrelevant. Okay. What are the. What are the birth. And the doctor dropping it. That. The irrelevant. And the dropping of the. The baby. I've absolutely no idea. Think about what's happened. She's had a baby. The doctors try to deliver it. He's saying it's a nice little baby you've got. This is all irrelevant. This is all irrelevant. Right. Let me tell you this. So. So just to be fair to Steve, so he gets. He can get into your mind. Right. This is not a traditional cryptic clue. Logical problem. This is. This is. Carl, what song am I thinking of? Right. That is Underworld. Born Slippy. I have to say, actually, that makes textbook sense. Yeah. No, that does actually. No. Sorry. Do you like all the story about. It's all right. You can see it in a minute. Or is just covered in gunk. No, I agree there is some extraneous detail, but I have to say. Yeah. That Bourne was good. Because it was. That's what. That's. Look at it. Was born. Was good. Yeah. And born sleepy. I. No, I'm actually. I was quite impressed by that, Carl. I have to say no, to be fair to you. I'm not just patronizing you. Oh, well, I've got. I actually think that was really good. And I. I disrespect Ricky Gervais for slamming that off, because I actually think that that was Quite cool. Well, let's go ahead with it then. I feel we could, we could maybe open this up to email correspondence or the phone. Okay, let's go for it then. Okay. This is Carl Pilkington's new game show idea. It's what? It's, it's just. What's the song? Carl Pilkington presents what's the song? Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Mr. Carl Pilkington. Okay, I'll tell you. Let's play a record. Let's, let's come back after, give out. The number ready for him. Well, you should make a note of this. You can email us. The email's up and running. Ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk Ricky.gervaisfm.Co.uk what's the phone number? Kyle, have you got 087-008-001234. Okay, 087-00-800-1234. Make a note of that and we'll, we'll have a game of. What song is Carl thinking of after this next track? What do you want to play? What have you got lined up? Oh, oh, continuing again, old fogies who were good once and I won't hear a thing said against them. You kids out there, it's not all new metal, is it? True enough. This is Cat Stevens, a little known album, Mona Bone Jack on. And this one's called Trouble. It's a lovely song. Cat Steven's Trouble from Mona Bone jack on on XFM 104.9. Playing some new songs, playing some old songs, playing some old games, some chit chat, some tears, some laughter. And Carl Pilkington with his brand new show. What's the song? What song am I thinking? No, I'm, I mean, you're nervous about. This, aren't you, Rick? You're worried. Well, because I've heard some of these clues before. They're ramblings that sometimes they're close to ramblings of a fool. Right? And it really is like those. What am I thinking? Yeah. I don't know though. I actually was genuinely impressed by Born Sleepy. I, I have to give him the best. That's one of the better ones because I, I. Because that was short, sweet and it worked. Some of these are. You say they're not gonna be quite as pissy. Some of them are like Emily Bronte novels. Now listen, we're just gonna go for it, then you do it and we just get people to call up because I, I want, I want to see the general public's confusion trying to work. Out why don't we, why don't we, why don't you give us your, your next clue and then we'll play a track and then we'll, we'll hopefully have people on the line after the track to try and answer it and you can recap briefly. So give us your clue. Now for what song am I thinking of? Right, this one, it's about a woman and she's just normal, Nothing wrong with her or so she thinks. Right. But there's the twist. Is this like the towers? The unexpected. She's got like, you know, she's got a mate and she's having a normal life, having a good time and that. And then, then this thing happens, right, and she starts to stink and she can't have a bath, right? And she really wants to have a bath. She's dead sweaty and stuff. She's trying, she's going about her daily stuff. She can do everything else normal. She can eat, she can talk, everything. But for some reason she can't have a bath. Is there a coal mining husband in the bath? Yeah. Is this born stinky? She can't have a bath. So a woman can't have a bath? Yeah, or a shower. She can't. Okay, leave it there, Rick. Don't try and guess it's not faster. Guess the general public can phone up and ask questions. So I just, just go through the can. Can they? I think so. We don't want just people just phoning up. What about this? Why don't. They can ask one question? Yeah, they can ask one question of Carl, then they have to make a guess. Okay. Oh, 700, 8001 2. Have we got someone on the line now? Let's do it. Let's go for one. Let's go for one. This is edgy radio. Let him. Dynamite stuff. Hello, xfm. Hello, I'm ringing about. What's the song? Absolutely. What do you think? Well, I'm going for Dirty Diana. Dirty Diana. See, that works. That's a great guess. It does, yeah. But it doesn't work because why can't she have a bath? Okay, so the answer is. I was gonna ask you. Well, that's your one question. That be the answer? That would be the answer, I'm afraid. What was your name? Shelley. Shelly. Thanks very much. I should tell you that, you know, that you should never take this personally because no one can really get into the mind of Carl. So don't, don't, you know, beat yourself up. I don't expect anyone to get these clues. So. So well done. That is a fine guess. Thank you. Okay, anyone else? That's. Hello, xfm, who's that on the line? It's Chris. Hello, Chris. A question for Carl before you give his. I haven't thought of a really good question or anything yet. You just want to go for the guess. Well, no, what I thought was I'm sure Simon Mayo used to do this when he did the Breakfast show on video one years ago. No, he didn't. So you just pinched this idea? Carl, if you're gonna rip someone off, Karl, do not rip off Mayo. I haven't ripped this off. I thought this was a new idea. I was going to do it with sound effects instead, but that's. Yeah, he used to do that. And he used to get his team to play other characters, you idiot. Well, no, hang on. Not you. Not you, Chris. I'm saying you idiot to Carl. Yeah, but nothing's new anyway, is it? So I'm not getting annoyed about it. What do you think the answer is? Is it Cornflake Girl by Tony Amos? Good answer. She couldn't have a bath because she'd go all. She's all soggy. So it's not, is it Cornflake Girl? No, it's not. But that's a great answer. It could have been. You're already seeing the error of this, aren't you? I think this is like great radio. I'm really hooked on this. I'm genuinely excited. This is really like that. Those so called lateral thinkers that a man got into a field and dies. Why? He ran out of there. No, not the one I'm thinking of. No. Yeah, that was a good answer. Like Simon Mayo, like sue you or something for doing it. Will you stop? Don't mention that. Yeah, listen, I think if you're going to steal ideas from someone, it should be a brain box like Mayo. I mean, he's the man. The only example of one I can ever remember hearing his show, because it was quite young then was some people were pretending to like tap someone's phone or something and then they got caught and the answer was just bugging by. Whistle because they were genius. That was absolute genius. That's the sort of standard you've got to come up against. Thanks very much, Chris. The phone lines are hot. Hello, xfm. Hi, is it Candy Perfume girl? Is it What? Candy Perfume Girl. Candy Perfume Girl? Yeah. Candy Perfume Girl. Is it? Well, who's that by? Madonna? No, it's. That sounds like an obscure album track. One of her songs just Think about it. She stinks and everything. She's a normal life. She's. I didn't say she was a sweet or anything, but she. For some reason, she can't have a bath. Is this a big song just to give him a clue? It's a bigger song than Candy. Sweet girl. Thank you very much indeed for your guess. It clearly is. Thank you. Cheers. Sorry. You know. Okay, one more, then we go to a record. Come on. Okay. Yeah. Is it High and Dry by Radiohead? High and High and dry. Now that's great. She smells, which is another word for high. She's dry because she doesn't have a shower. Carl, if it isn't that, yours will never be as good as that. He's the winner. Whatever you're thinking of, that clue is brilliant. What's your name, mate? It's Richie. Richard. I mean, you can't beat that. That's a bit too lateral. Don't be stupid. It's perfect. He's made yours into a clever clue. He's made high. She smells dry. She never gets in the bath or shower. It's not that, is it, Carl? You don't even get that, do you? Not really. Have you ever heard of the word high being used to mean sort of smelling? No. No, no. Oh, that was where you went wrong there, mate. Richard. Well, I'm declaring you the winner, even though that isn't the answer. I don't think we should give up this. Can we just. Let's play a song and give it one more chance. Because, yeah, if people think about it, it is really easy. So I'm not gonna find out the. Answer, though, because I've got to go out. Okay, we'll do it very quickly. Stay in for 10 minutes. We're just gonna play a new. Okay, tracker. Okay. Let's read a Coldplay and then. Coldplay one I love. That's for Nick, Neil, Olivia in Tower Bridge. Absolutely. And also Nikki from Bromley. You emailed in. She's enjoying the show and she. She wanted a bit Coldplay. That's the B side of the current single. This is a great show, isn't it? We've got great music, we've got laughs, tears, we've got requests, we've got Simon Mayo games. Yeah, it's a bit. It's just. It's just like Radio 1 for less people. Radio 1 for less people. This is great. So listen, Guy, you were so excited about this game, weren't you, earlier? You can. You came in with a hop, skip and a leap in your step. Although I must say, the phones are going mental. We're gonna have to take people. I mean, high and dry is great. I mean, it works. Can we have a very quick. Just a recap in case someone's just trying. Can you make it. Can you make it so high and dry doesn't work? Now give us a bit of information that makes it different to high and dry or Carl. So for those that have just tuned in, Carl describes, in a roundabout way a story which somehow is representative of a song. Is that song title? A song title? Okay, so this woman, she's. She's. She's all right, you know, she has a normal life, pretty much, kind of. Yeah. There's probably a few things, actually, that she can't do thinking about it. But the main problem would be having a wash or having a bath or having a shower. Yeah. Maybe going for a swim, thinking about it. Right. I think water is the clear, isn't it? Who's that on the line? Hi, there, it's Mark. Hello, Mark. Hi, Mark. It smells like Team spirit. Nirvana. No, it's not. That's a great guess. Smells like Teen spirit again. It's all so brilliant. Thank you, Mark. Well done. No, it's not that. All right. Hello, xfm. Oh, that's. That's. That's a dodgy mobile. That's a bit of a clip. Oh, they've just given up. They've all been going for Smells like team spirit. They just hung up. Hello, xfm. Hi. Is it. She's electric. Excellent. She's electric. It makes sense. That's fantastic. She's electric. Why does she smell? Because she doesn't have a bath and that. Because she can't have a bath or a shower. What's. What's your name? Neil. Neil. Neil. Got it. So did you get it straight away? No, only during the song. A process of elimination from all the other wrong answers. Yeah, basically. So. She's electric. Rick, I have to say, you're holding your head in hand in your hands and it looks like you want to shoot off. But I have to say I thought that was quite good. I genuinely thought that was quite good. But it's not a cryptic clue, is it? Because it's not. She smells. There's a few things you can't do. She's electric. Yeah, but do you understand what. What I'm getting at? I always understand what you're getting at, Carl. That's never been a problem in the years I've known you, Neil. Got it. Yeah. I have to say, I think you're down on this idea. I could definitely see that. ITV1 replacing get I'm A Celebrity. Get Me out of Here. Carl Pilkerton hosting Simon Mayo on the phone. Exactly. To the lawyers. Well, well, Neil, there's no prizes or anything, but well done. Well done. That was well worth it. Right, well, you go away with the awards in the knowledge that you've beaten Carl. Yeah. You can get secure in the knowledge that you thought how Carl does. Absolutely. Well done, Neil. I have to say, I. I think you're being harsh on him. I think that's a great thing. All right, let's do it again next week. I thought that was a great game. Brilliant play record. What do you want to play? Oh, you know, I'll tell you, we've been playing some oldies, Rick, and I've enjoyed them all. But. But I think I've been in love with this song for many, many years. And when I saw it reminded of it in Conair. The film Conair. Remember, they stick it on in Conair and it's just dynamite. Lynyrd Skynyrd. I love this. Sweet Home Alabama. Turn this up. Turn it. Sweet home Alabama. Leonard Skynyrd. Strange and beautiful Aqualung. Or as Carl says, aqua Lung on XFM 104.9. Well, it seems that Carl's clue, you know, did go down quite well. Some other people got it. The game show as a whole has been well received. Well, I have to say, the. The email, you know, we've had. We've had loads of emails, Rick. You know, I mean, we've had. Let me just count two. And one of them was aimed at Simon Mayo came to us by mistake. They thought they were listening to Mayo. Yeah. And the other is saying, Carl, they love the game show. Radio 1 with less people. Yeah. And so despite the fact it was a stolen idea, I think we can do it again next week. Let's rustle up some prizes as well. You're just like your little magpie, aren't you? Thieving shiny ideas from Mayo's Nest. Absolutely. We played Lynard Skinner just before the ads and I was just looking at the compilation it comes from. It's a great combination. We took this from Driving Rock. Yeah. Which I imagine is not available in the shop. Exactly. I imagine it's come straight. Straight from the personal collection of maybe Taran or Foxy or Canfield. But there's some great names on here that I'd like to see. Maybe we could play little Vance and he. He's a tiny van, you Know, you're a little Mayo. Canfield's a little Vance. I mean, these are some names just gone. I haven't heard them for a long time. I'd love to hear them again. Alana. Miles Blackfell. No, rubbish. Rhea. You don't hear. Rhea. Yeah. What one? Spin Doctors. Oh, God, Lest we forget. The Spin Doctors. Crash Test Dummies. What happened to them? Don't know. Who else we got on here? Richard Marks. Yeah. Mr. Big. I didn't. He's guilty. In that song, when he goes. I swear I did. And all that. And the police came around. Well, there's no smoke without fire. I reckon he did it, to be honest. I reckon he murdered her. You're absolutely right. Go on. Legs. ZZ Top. She knows how to use them. She knows how to use it. What it is, it's electrical impulse from the brain. How is she using them? She's just. It's. You know. Though the brothers do be on here as well. Oh, isn't that. There's nothing wrong with that. Absolutely. No. It's Starship. Yeah. And Toto as well. It's not actually. What is it? Can you name another Toto track? Hold the Line. It's hold the Line. Let's rock. Put that stuff. Is it good stuff? When session musicians get together. Oh, we got a quick little blaster. Play a little bit. Hold the Line. Yeah, that should be track. Let me see. That's probably track 10. I hope this doesn't annoy too many people. Like, we're worried. Yeah. Yeah. We like to give our radio slick. Is this it? This is not it. Yeah. Giving us his best air guitar. That was dynamite. That was great. We'll have some. I think we should have like a classic rock anthem every week. Oh, do you not think? I'd love to. A bit of Rainbow. Maybe next week. Who knows? Phone in if you want to hear some classic rock. Classic rock. We ripped off Mayo. Let's do that. Absolutely. Let's just steal ideas from other better DJs. Okay. There's some great ideas out there, I'm sure. I mean, if you want to. Like any fix, it's done. If you may want to eat a packed lunch on a roller coaster. On a roller coaster? Yeah. With some Boy Scouts. Or dance with Nanarama. Yeah. Then. Or five star. Yeah. I love the fact. Five star reform. There's three of them. Have you heard about this? No. White Stripes on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Well, I had A good time. I've enjoyed it. Yeah, it's been nice. Be fun. Some good tracks, some. Some laughs. And you're Competition by Simon Mayo. That was absolutely. That was great. Yeah. Yeah. Carl, have you heard the big news that Ricky Gervais is looking to take up? Well, you explain it to me. It's not big news. No. What are you doing? What do you mean? You're taking up boxing. Is this right? No. What is the story? You want to be fighting for money? No. Yeah, Bare knuckle fighting. Come on, what is it? No, all it is. I've been watching this show on cable called Born to Fight and it's sort of like. I think it's on after roadies, which is like. Yeah, it's a bloke, one bloke with the cameras that goes on tour with different people. Like he went with Motorhead, he went with a meatloaf tribute act. He went on with Coldplay, was in one of them. It's that and it's the same. Like all the other channels has been switched off. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And there's one called Born to Fight and they just take a different story. It might be an amateur fight or it might be an unlicensed fight, not illegal, or it might be white collar, which I'm thinking of doing. What's. What's white collar? White collar is just people who want to fight and it's organized. Is it like fight club? Yes, but it's charity. It's safe. It's a charity. Do you have big events and it's just two people that, you know, aren't boxers, aren't amateur boxers, and they get in the ring, they do three, three, two minute rounds and they just. Just lay into each other, got head guards on and. Look, I don't mean to alarm you, but, you know, we work together, obviously, and we make the office and stuff. Your face is my fortune. I can't have that. Must be a bit of a worry for you. It is. I'm not gonna say. Well, your heart as well is also a concern. Yeah. You know, and you're eating and stuff. So when I said I was gonna get fit, you go, no, Gervais, you're only funny because you're fat. No, I agree, this is true. But I'm saying there's a. There's a difference between being fit. Yeah. And. And I would say, for instance, don't eat. Well, don't eat. Don't eat kind of, you know, cheese and bacon, you know, on their own, all for breakfast. So what I'M saying is there's a difference between, you know, exercising and then having your face beating in. And what I'm saying is that you, it. I just don't think it's a good idea. But I might win. No, well, I don't. That's, that's, that's irrelevant. You're still going to take a couple of blows to the face. And the point is this, Rick. You're not going to win. No, because you are delusional. You think that you are probably the world's greatest boxer. Ever since I've known you. You seem to think that that's the case because you've watched all the Rocky films and you think that's fair enough. That seems straightforward enough. But look at your physique, you know. Yeah, you've got some upper body strength, but you know, you've also got some lower belly strength as well. I noticed. And my concern is you're going to go in there and you're not only going to be a broken man when you realize that you're just not as handy in the ring as you thought you were, but also you're going to incur some interest. This is fighting talk. This is fighting talk. The first fight club is. Don't talk about fight clubs. This one's been able to do it more now just because of you. It was the same when Adrian didn't agree that Rocky could beat Club A. Lang. Yeah, she made that mistake. Then she made the same mistake with Draco. At what age she turns up at. The end to take a bit of the credit, didn't she? When you were this kind of thin, nimble youth in your makeup and your eyeliner and all the rest of it, I bet you had no idea, you had no thoughts about boxing. It never came into your mind, did it? So at what age did you suddenly think, wait a minute, I've taken the wrong path in life. I could have been the world heavyweight? I don't think I could. When have you suddenly decided that you can suddenly be a bit street tough? I don't understand why this has suddenly come about in. Well, I'm not putting out a shout, am I? To fight people, it's not like Noel Gallagher and Robbie Williams, but you've got. To find someone else, presumably to fight with. Yeah, but it'd probably be a businessman who, who wants to fight, right? Do you know, there's something really weird about that, don't you think? That's like, have you just listened to yourself? I want to fight another. I want to fight A businessman. Please, may I fight a businessman? I want to fight someone who wants to, you know, it's not. I want to fight them, though. I want to fight somebody. It sounds a bit mad. Bring them on. I want to fight people. No, but it's more that. It's more the effort and the training, the commitment to it. Like climbing a mountain. Mountain. I mean, I think climbing a mountain and doing a marathon is ridiculously macho. It's not the fact that you can. No, that's not macho compared with macho. Isn't it climbing? There's no reason to climb. There's no need to do a marathon if you can run a mile. That's all you need. The fact that you train is to whether you can do it yourself and achieve something. And this is more like the training and the learning skill and then seeing if it works. I don't want to get in there. Aren't you concerned about you might get beaten or you might get beaten up? I should say no. What's the worst that could happen? Black eyes, bruises and bruises. Bruises. Let me just remind you of the time we were working in your flat, right? And you immediately, I think. I don't know to this day what happened, but you started choking. You clasped your chest, you were breathing, wheezing, right? I leapt over to you. I remember screaming. I don't know the Heimlich maneuver. If you've swallowed something, I can't help. Yeah, you gained your breath, you gained your composure. I said, what happened? Did you eat something? Did you go down the wrong way? You said, no, I swallowed some dust. I swallowed some dust. You breathed some dust in. That was in the air. There was some dust in the air. You breathe that in, it knocked you. Out for two days, Rick. You were in bed for two days. I love that. I don't think you. I don't think you're gonna have that job. And that's some dust. What do you think this businessman's gonna do? He'll be permanent. Hurt your poemant. Yeah, he'll hurt your poemant. You found a lump, didn't you, on your testicle? Once we sat in a doctor's waiting room. I remember for about four hours. You've got checked out. It was fine. I think I went twice, didn't I? Yeah. But I said to the doctor at one point, I said, did you check round the back? Yeah. I was thinking he hadn't checked it. Yeah. Oh, dear. Just because I haven't found anything. My point is this. You're something of a Hypochondriac. You know, you're something of a hypochondriac. You know that already. So why do you think this is gonna be any different? Wow. If you take it, when you take the first blow to the head, you take the punch, you'll immediately think that you've got some kind of, you know, brain disorder. No, I always want to do it. But I just thought. I just wanted to make sure. I wanted to know that I definitely lost my looks, right? And I've seen some of the publicity shots. I've got mirrors and mouths. So now, because I've definitely lost my looks, now, I've got nothing to lose. Yeah. So I want, you know, maybe a younger, more handsome man. I want to teach him. Yes. Let me just. I'll end with this, right? For people who listen to this show regularly, you already sound like you're punch drunk, all right? And that's just your natural way of talking. Please, let's not do the real thing. Oh, play a record. Oh, I mean, is it going to be televised? Well, we could get it on dvd, maybe release it now. I'm interested. Okay. Is there money to be made? Yeah, that's the money. Maybe we should talk about it. Okay. On XFM 104.9. And join us now live at Shipyard people's home where TV star Ricky Gervais is taking on his first non professional bout. Ricky, who are you fighting this evening called Pete Smedley. Okay, Pete Smedley. How old is Pete? He's 72. 72 years old? Yeah. And yeah, you're very excited about the fight. I know he's just recovered from a massive coronary, hasn't he? Well, I don't want to get into that. He's deemed himself fit and that's good enough for me if he wants to fight. Listen, right, Someone just called up and said they're fight me. He sounded pretty tasty. I said, how, how tall? He said, Five foot eleven. I said, What'd you weigh? Said 13 stone. I said, how old are you? 27. I explained to him I'm looking for someone a lot older and smaller. Absolutely. A lot, lot older and smaller. Donna Stell, if Donna Stell from what's it. I'm going to show you now. Steve, this is not. It's just a sport, you know. Oh, don't go into badminton. The shuttlecock can hurt your eye. It's just a sport. Okay, fair enough. We'll, I'm sure, resume this conversation next week. But of course, we'll also be playing more of Carl's new brilliant game with prizes. Yeah. Yeah. Simon Mayo's. What is Carl thinking? Absolutely. I'll leave you with a song for the ladies, Rick, if I may. This is by my friend Harry. You may know he sends me tracks every so often that I should listen to. And this is a particular favorite of mine. Pretty pleasing. It's by Kevin Tahista's Red Terror. I don't know if I've pronounced that right, but enjoy that and we'll see you next week. Let's get ready to rumble.",
