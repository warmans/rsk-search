  "text": "Just because Jane's Addiction are back, then. Yeah. Excellent. And so are we. All right, I'm Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington pressing the buttons on XFM 104.9. Well, I'm looking forward to today because not only have I got, you know, a bit of Bowie, bit of Springsteen, Mop the Hoople, Pretenders, rem, an out on John Classic. Don't laugh. Right. But we've taken Dr. Fox's advice and prepared the show and I've got a big list here of amusing observations coming up after the next record. A funny observation about describing your looks. Brilliant. All right. Oh, before I just say, Rick, I've just sent an email. Beach Buggy. Your last chance to see them on Thursday, 4. June. Alright. So don't miss out. The garage 9:45. It's your last chance. Beach Buggy. Well, I know that must be some people's favorite record, Steve. Well, it's only one of mine. Thunder Road. Bruce Springsteen. I won't hear a bad word said against the Boss. A lot of people dismiss him, as we said in the past, as being some kind of stadium rocker, but you can't listen to a song like that and not be moved, surely, Carl? It's all right. Yeah, brilliant. A passionate man. Yeah. So, Carl. No, no, no, that's right. Certain songs like that was. That was all right. It didn't sound anything if it wasn't Bruce Springsteen. If someone new came out saying like that, I'd go, yeah, it's all right. Sure. You know what I mean? Yeah. You're a regular Simon Cowell, aren't you? I don't know if I like music as much as I used to. Now that's what happens when you're working, isn't it? Because Danny Minogue was on the telly. Was it like when you work in a sweet factory and you don't. You don't nick the Mars bars after a couple of months. Yeah, yeah. Donnie Minogue was on the telly in the week, right. And she was doing. Doing a medley. Yeah. Why do people do them? Well, to try and get all the hits. I know, I know what you mean. Yeah. But he was that busy that they haven't got time to listen to a full album or. It'S like a meal in pill form. Yeah, Well, I like most of Danny Minogue's hits, but I don't like the whole song. Yeah, exactly. So if you want to just like pop the best bits down, 30 seconds, put them all together. Yeah, well, I've got a stars on 45 record from the 70s. Do you remember those? Yeah, stars on 45. But it's that, like you say. I mean, this one had a kind of. It would be a snatch of Stevie Wonder, followed by the MASH theme, followed by Layla. Just the intro. It was sort of. It's not music. Yeah, well, we do a bit of that, don't we, though? That's what DJing isn't. It's a bit of everything. But we play the whole song, don't we, Often? Yeah. We're better, aren't we, Carl? So what do you want to talk about today? Do you want to look at the list? Yeah, well, it's. It's got Describe looks. That's our list reaper. So this is a very amusing sort of link about describing your look. I don't know. What's this? I don't remember this. No, I just was thinking, like, you know, everyone's got an idea in the red, right? Don't open yourself up to criticism. Go on. Yeah, everyone's got, like. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? Everyone's got an idea of what they look like and stuff. If someone wanted to know what I look like or what Ricky looked like or what you look like, Steve, if that. Yeah. What would you use to describe yourself? Do you know what I mean? Not really. I don't understand what. What do you mean? Well, like, someone who doesn't know us, we've got to describe and we've. What's. What's the game? To hopefully get. Get some sort of interpersonal language going. So, you know, they've got the same image as you to a certain extent. Just thinking, if I was to meet Steve in a restaurant. Yeah, right. Nothing untoward going on. We're just hanging out. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Who's paying? Because, I mean, is it expensive? I mean, right, So I. I say to you, I'll. I'll see you at 8. Right. In this. In this restaurant, I turn up at the door. It's a bit of a posh place, right? So he's Steve Merchant in. Yeah. On the way to sort of goes, I. I don't know, what does he look like? Right. And where's he from? Just a little French fella. Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah. And what does he look like? So I had the thing I pick up on first. Tall, tall lad. Tall, yeah. And then he goes, oh, you know, we got lots of tall people. Right. And I go, big eyes, big eyes. And then he'd go, yeah, he's over there. I'll be Honest with you. I mean, you can have dinner and you can buy me dinner. I'm not sure you're gonna get anywhere with me if you're slagging me off. I'm not slagging you off, though. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Just using. Using what comes to mind. And can I just. Tall and big eyes. Can I assume that they know, like. Could I say, like. Easiest for me would. I'd say, looks like Reg Varney from on the buses. Would they understand that? Can I use sort of like kick references? It's 30 odd. This. This waiter. So he'll. So I go, oh, yes, Reg is sitting over there. Yeah. So he went German towards the end. See, I describe you more, Rick, I think, as I would imagine. I'd say, have you ever seen that Johnny Vegas on the telly? Yeah. Imagine he was inflatable and he just let out a little bit of air. Well, at least that's what Ricky would. Look as opposed to, like, you know, pumping harder. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's great car. I describe as. You know those little red monkeys that you see on wildlife programs. They're little, they're in the trees and they scream when they see a leopard or something. Shave that. Just shave one of those little red monkeys and put some sort of, you know, old sort of Manchester gear on it, maybe. Yeah. You know what I mean? Banana rack and some baggy jeans. I'd like to see how the waiter would react to that. He's got a picture of monkey, then he's got a picture. He's shaved. He's got no hair. And they dress like some kind of mank. Scallop echo. He's over there. Yeah, he's over there. Carl's over there. That's what I do. So now. Now, coming up, the Verve after that amusing link about gay handkerchiefs. Really, I'm looking forward to this. Lucky man by The Verve on XFM 104.9 on Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl, what's the problem with Guyankes? You were. You played Bruce Springsteen last week. Yeah, right. Yeah. And you said he had got a load of trouble on his hands when he had had a Hank in his back pocket. Did I say that on air or. Well, we were just saying that famously on the COVID of the Born to Run, Born in the USA album. It's just him, isn't it? With just his backside, basically a red hat. I wasn't looking. Well, I just. Well, I did it for research. Purposes for this amazing link. Yeah. He had a red handkerchief, I think, in his right hand pocket. And apparently that signifies homosexuality. Apparently. I don't know. I don't know. Oh, I thought it was. Which way you take. I don't know. These are those myths, aren't they? Yeah, well, exactly. I don't even know if. No, well, I. I read up about it. Okay, Right. Just for research. And it's all sort of, you know, you've got all different colored ankies. Are they? Yeah. Right. And it depends what pocket you put it in as well. So you've got like the different colours, different pockets. Yeah. And so how many variations are there? Different pockets? Is what, your back pocket? Your right back pocket. But what do they mean? What do you mean? Well, what do they signify? You can't just tell us they signify so much. What do they signify? Well, some. Some stuff that we don't really want to talk about, to be honest. What sort of stuff that gays are into. Wait, what do you mean? Barbra Streisand records? Yeah, yeah. Eurovision. No, like a couple of things that were there that I know we can mention. They said something about. I love what he thinks he can't mention. I love it. Decency. What is this, 1956? No, no, no, but I mean, it isn't just, you know, having it away. I love him having it away. You get up to some weird stuff. I love the fact that he didn't want to offend. Offended a lot more people by saying they get up to some weird stuff. Right. In your opinion? Yeah. What do you mean? No, no, but don't. If it's. If. If there is something that I don't know about that it's like you can't say on the radio. Yeah, I'd rather not. But what do you mean weird stuff? Well, one of them. Right. If you've got a red Anki. Right. Yeah. In your right pocket. Like Bruce. Yeah, that's exactly what Bruce had. Yeah. Right. Well, apparently then Bruce is an armpit freak. An armpit freak? Yeah. No, really? No, no, but that's very specific. Go. Seriously. Well, okay. Right, okay. What else is there? Sorry? Is there some kind of homosexual body that sat down and came up with this at some point? Well, you said we've got one where this is getting crazy. You've got like a blue handkerchief in your top breast pocket. I don't know what that means. You need to sit down. As I'm going to sum it, figure out what it means. Yeah, it's Just that you're not. You're not free from it either. So if you were to go in, like, a gay bar, which, you know, you might do if you're straight anyway, because they're, you know, good, good places, I think you can't actually go in there if you've got a cold because every colored hanky represents something. Right. So if I was to go in, had a bit of a sniffle, I could get into all sorts of trouble. Well, pull out a Marks and Spencer's white linen hanky. That means you like to be tied up and whipped. Yeah. There was another one. Armpit freak was covered. Armpit Freak is done. We've covered Armpit freak. I don't really know what that means. Right. Okay. Yeah. There was just one other thing. Like a blue and white one is if you're into sailors. To sailors. Yeah. If you have a little blue and white anki that's in your left pocket. Blue and white equals sailor. So I wanted to ask you something about, you know. Okay, we gotta be careful here. You know, when you wouldn't leave the building that was on fire because you were. You were standing proud. Hang on. We need this. Some people now don't know what you're talking about. You, Carl, you're on holiday. Yeah. On holiday in Tenerife. Right. You'd had a moment of intimacy with your girlfriend. Yeah. A knock on the door. You had to stop and get up. You peeked around the door. It was a fireman saying, get out, but you didn't want to leave because you added. Yeah, yeah. It was little. Yeah, but what I, I. What I don't understand is you maintained that while looking at a Spanish man dressed as a fireman. Yeah. Is that true? Is that, Is that the fact you maintained, I'm sorry to say, you. You maintained a, you know, arousal whilst looking at a gentleman dressed as a fireman. No, no. Is. Is that. These are the facts and they are undisputed. What did you maintain? I'm not a machine, though, do you know? I mean, I can't turn it on. Turn it off. I just thought talking to a fireman, you'd have probably lost it. I don't know. But you didn't. No, but the other thing was, I mean, I was talking to Suzanne about it again, right. I said, oh, it just cropped up. Right. Yeah. And the dilemma was, you see, I wanted to try and make sure that it was a proper fire because that was the last condom we had, right. So it would have ruined the night. So I was, I Didn't want to, like, it was like, you know, what's going on? Is it. Is, is it. Do we need to get out? Yeah. Is it a proper fire? Yeah. And you've been. I'm talking to this man in uniform. Was he. What did he look like? Was he quite. Was he good looking? Did he look like Ricky Martin? Say, was he good looking? Was he good looking in his uniform? I can't remember. Can't remember. Did he have a mustache? Better play a record, didn't we? Is this bringing it back? Look uncomfortable? What, did you just switch this on with your hand? Flaming Lips. And that's fight. Test lips and test lips. Test on M. We were talking there about homosexual people. And I'm sure we'll move on to other topics, but I just mentioned I was talking to a friend of mine in the week, Rufus, and he overheard, he pieced together that, you know, sometimes if you overhear a conversation, you can piece together what's going on. Yeah. You know, and it sort of transpired from what you can. What you could make out that one gay guy had just realized or just found out that his gay boyfriend had maybe been having an affair and was on the phone and had called this person, the third party. The other one was crying, wasn't he? The other one was crying in tears. Obviously they just had a big argument about it. And all he heard on the phone was was the guy saying in a very kind of earnest tones, I'm gonna do everything in my power to destroy you. Well, I just like to think what that was. What was he, you know, no more. Guest list to G A Y. I. Am going to slash your diesel jeans with a pair of scissors. Oh, they're listening now. I know. I mean, it's probably an emotional time for them. Yeah. But they probably don't think we're talking about them. No, not those. It's probably happened quite a lot this week. Well, possibly. I. I do know quite a lot of gay people, but they do, they do jump about when it comes to partners. Right, Carl? No, Freedom of speech. Yeah. Let the man speak. No, I'm not saying that's a bad thing. I mean, it's. It's quite it, you know, they don't. You know, if they get bored, they move on. On that, which is fair enough. But they do. You piece this together and they go. Out like, don't they? Well, we've covered that, haven't we? We've done that, yeah. How have you. So you're. You. Do you know how we covered that? His favorite record is Killing a Georgie. And he went. At the end of the record, he went, see? But how late was it? Yeah, if he'd have been sort of going up at a decent time, that wouldn't have happened. You know what I mean, Steve, though, they're always getting ready to go out about half past one in the morning. You're asking for trouble. Yes, incidentally, I should just point out that. Oh, dear. That we've had an email. I've lost it here now. But anyway, it was one of our listeners saying that we've slightly embarrassed ourselves because, of course, Bruce Springsteen on the COVID of Born in the USA doesn't actually have a handkerchief in his back pocket. It's actually a red baseball cap. So I don't know if that also counts. I don't know if it's any kind of. Yeah. Into eds. Into little round eds. Oh, if Bruce Springsteen. And he's obviously not gay, but if he said, all right, Carl, just, you know, little cuddle, would you turn down Bruce Springsteen? Yeah, well, no, but why? Just like, all right, mate, you know, you hug your mates, don't you? If Bruce said, all right, Carl, like your show, love your head. Little cuddle, little cuddle, a mate cuddle. No, I just. Oh, what you. I say what you're doing. He's just say, look, we're a couple of old friends. Bruce winks. Number of those great songs. I like what you're doing. Let's cuddle. Let's have a little. All right. The only thing is, right, Steve, right. Do you know he likes to squeeze me head? I think he likes to squeeze me head. Yeah. He had an old mate over this week. He's got a similar shaped head apparently as mine. Yeah. Right. He's hardly gave me a call or anything because he was busy with this other fella's head. Oh, you feel quite bad about that. Is he's a better head to squeeze. I'll tell you why. Because he shaves his every day. Right. He's got the same sort of hair problem. Shaves every day. Right. No problem. No, I know. And it's because he's had it every time. Like Carl's is sort of comes through a bit long at the side sometimes. It looks a bit unkempt. Towards the end of the week. I've seen there's a little. There's a couple of little pimples under there, but I really have to do it, just like get there, slap my hands in it, squeeze it. With this one, I can sort of get my Thing. Do you know what I mean? I'll get my. Really, you know. You know you like a guy, the way you jump about from head to head. You like a guy. Just saying. Right, still coming up then. What we got coming up? We got Rockbusters. Is there any monkey news this week? It's been a problem. Why? It's not much has been going on this week. What, in the monkey world? In the monkey world. I don't know if they've caught on to the fact that they're getting coverage. They're keeping their behavior hush hush, being a bit careful. But I found something. Have we got Rockbusters? It's your last chance, don't forget. Is it good? These Rockbusters got some of the prizes. Steve will look at them in a bit. Cheeky Freak of the Week. Have you got a Cheeky freak of the Week? Got that, Got that, yeah. So what deformer is it this week that you're ridiculing? Well, keep listening. I didn't really appreciate the Stones when I was younger. I was always a Beatles fan, but now I can't really listen to the Beatles. I just like. It's like I've used them up. It's about five tracks. I like. Yeah, the Stones just get better and better. And that one's brilliant. And the video's so Good. Amazing. From 1981. That was waiting on a friend from the Rolling Stones. What we got, we got more fun coming up, I imagine. Yeah. Cheeky Freak of the Week. An amusing story about inflatable testing. We've already given you half an hour talking about gay people. Who knows what else will be coming up? Yeah, it's big market. Out Of Time by Blair on XFM 104.9. All right, Carl? What are you thinking? Stinking stuff. You're an enigma, aren't you? Can we just say hello to. We've got an American listener, apparently. Karen. I thought that might fill up four seconds. We're not struggling, are we? No, no. I mean, we can't just consult the list of Dr. Fox esque music. Wet ones. Screwball Shop train. Cheeky freak. Ronan. What was Ronan. Ronan. I just was telling you the other day about, you know that. That song that he does, Loving Every Day is if it's your last one. Right. Yeah. I'm just thinking he's saying that as if, like, I'll have a good day. But I reckon if you knew it was your last day, I don't think you'd be in the mood to do anything. Yeah, but what's true? Well, yeah, I think the point is that it's living a day like it should last. So, God, imagine if it was every day like last. Right, let's go mental. And the good thing is we've got tomorrow. So he's got the best of both worlds. That's what Ronan's saying. He's saying, cram it in because it might be the last. I think it's more like. It's the not knowing, isn't it? Live every day. See, I'd be. See, I'll actually be happy if. If I never knew when I was gonna die. And I was definitely gonna die. I'm asleep. What a brilliant life you'd have. Do you know what I mean? Well, so you don't get an illness, but one night you go to bed. And I know that if you knew you were gonna die in the sleep. I never knew when you're gonna die. It wouldn't matter if it was tomorrow or 30 years time, it wouldn't matter, would it? Yeah, I've lost you oven. I've lost you somewhere I can't work out. That was. See, I thought that was pretty easy, all that. I said die in your sleep and not know when you died. There was no high concept there, no sleight of hand, linguistically. What. Where did I lose you? I think you lost him on sleight of hand, linguistically, just. Then you've lost him again. I think that's the way I'd want to go. I don't. I don't want to know about it. That's why I don't go to the doctors or anything. That's a good, brilliant approach. And he. Do, you know, remember him saying he's going to die of cancer because he doesn't check his balls. He doesn't like the feel, of course. Of course. What do they feel like? Your balls? Like a. Like a wet chamois leather. With two marbles. Two kumquats in a wet chamois leather. No, but I just. Why are they wet, sweaty? No, they're not. I'm just saying smooth. Are they smooth? Yeah. Because a chamois leather's smoother when it's. Do you shave them? No, I don't. In case a fireman pops around. You want to look your best. It looks like your head. The fireman pops around, there you are. And he goes, oh, nice. Smooth. So you never go to the doctors? Well, even I don't. I don't like it. But if you found some buboes under your Arm or something. You. I'd wait for a bit and I'd say to Suzanne, what do you think of this? Just see if it develops into plague. Well, yeah, because you know, don't you? Loud bandages around your head. Yeah. And a bell. Yeah. Suzanne, how can you get me a bell? Exactly. Brilliant. There was this kid at our school we took the piss out of for the. Basically the rest of his time there because when he was about 11, someone said, how would you want to die? Right? Drowning? Fire. That. He said, I want to die of old age in my mother's arms. How old was he? My nephew. Loser. My mother's arm. What? Getting off with her. What was that? Die of old age. To an old cheek. Brilliant. I want to die of old age with banana in my mouth. Yeah. All in the same bed. Oh, damn. So if you. If you. If. If it was the last day, if you had one day to live, okay, what would you do with your day? Now, let's assume that it's. You're not. You're not in a state of ill health. There's not much you can do. It's just the end of the world and you. What do you mean there's not much you can do? That's what we're asking you. It's the last day of your life. It depends, doesn't it? If we're all in the same boat. If someone says, oh, unlucky, without bitterness, like, oh, we accidentally exposed you to some radiation, boys, and you got a day. Or if it was like, there's a meteor coming this way, we're all in the same boat. I think it would be different. It depends whether it's you and the rest of the world. No, I do the same thing. I'd steal a car and go joyriding, but, like, go mental. I'd be smashing stuff. I'd be knocking people over for a laugh. I'd be going crazy. It'd be like Grand Theft Auto. Extraordinary. Brilliant. Driving through parks. That's why I did the Getaway. Yeah. I tried to play it. Seriously. Within about 10 minutes, I was just going around areas I knew, trying to knock people over. Yeah, I. I don't think I'd want to do that much. Seriously, you can watch telly because you. You might not know how the thing ends. Sure. Yeah. You could watch 24, couldn't you, if you had a day? Yeah. On DVD. Do that, then. Do that, do that. Yeah, well, but I mean, let's be honest. You. Let's say you. You know, you can take all the Money out of your bank account, you can fly anywhere in the world, you can do whatever you want. Well, not a long flight. Well, no, but you've got your girl straight that. You wouldn't make it, would you? Why don't you? What? What? Why wouldn't you go to the monkey sanctuary down in Cornwall and just run around cuddling as many monkeys as you can? I'm gonna tell you something now. Go on, go in there next week. Oh, yeah, yeah. Taking my mum and dad away. Because like Suzanne's mum and dad, most. People put them in a home. Monkey sanctuary is cheaper. Second, taking them down the. Yeah, taking them down to Carol. Hold on, I thought you said you'd never go away with parents again. No, no, but that was Suzanne's mom and dad. Oh, this is. Is this to get even or something? Yeah, so we'll do that and then. Then we'll can it then. That was your outing your phone. And both sets of parents goes, right, you won't be seeing us ever again on holiday. We've taken you away. We've taken you away. Be careful that the monkey people don't buy you off your parents. And don't make sure. Make sure they don't leave any of the monkeys food in the telephone box. Cuz your dad'll have that away. Yeah, no, I was talking to him about that the other day about the nicking him phone boxes and he. Did you just explain that they live. In a small village in Wales and it's like one sort of utility store and when it's shut, they leave you shopping in the telephone box across the road. And Carl's dad found out about this, goes now to himself. Yeah. To other people shopping. That's terrible. Yeah, go on. And I was talking to him about that, saying, you know, have you picked up any surprises in the phone books and said, no, no, we were talking about all the stuff he used to do. One of them used to be going in this supermarket, right. In Manchester. Yeah. Needs a new pair of shoes. Yeah. Go in, took a new pair off the shelf, pop them on, leave his old ones there. Really? And walk out again. Yeah, brilliant. Floor. And then you go in after him, buy his old ones back, like an idiot. Yeah. You'd go in the next day. They look nice. My dad's got a pair just like that. I've always wanted some. Can I have bones? It's funny, we don't advocate the stealing. Of shoes from shops or the joyriding and killing people. Unless you've got one day left. Okay. Or phone Boxes. John Fighting M Gervais Merchant Pilkington Rockbusters. Oh, brilliant. Is there a jingle for Rockbusters? I don't think there's ever been one, is there? No. Can you come up with one quickly? Oh, rock bastards. Brilliant. All right, well, the prizes this week, there's not many, I have to say. Carl's not sourced many, but what he's got are actually good quality. Well, I've tried to insert in him that it's, you know, quality, not quantity. Absolutely. As opposed to like 15 copies of, you know, Fools and Offices Christmas special with a giveaway three wheeler car and Primal Screams greatest hits on 11 CDs. Yeah, not Primal screaming. Spiral cards. Oh, that was it. Yeah. Yeah, Spiral carpets. Anyway, yeah, we've got this new Kiss FM hip hop classics compilation. It's got some really good stuff on there. New stuff from the likes of, you know, Outcast and the Wu Tang, but some old classics from Public Enemy and of course LL Cool J's Mama said knock you out. It's worth having alone for that track. Yeah, Yeah. I think this is four CDs. No, two CDs. The best air guitar album in the world, volumes one and two. And a special box set. You've got all sorts on there. Brian Adams is on there, Rob. But also excellent stuff. Beastie Boys, Clash, we got the Kinks, so that's good. Abigail's Party, the. The DVD theme. Alison Steadman. I know you're quite a fan of that, aren't you, Rick?

Is that exclusive? It's not even out yet, is it? Wow. That's the sort of things that Carl can come up with if pushed. It's all about the game, though. It's all about the game. The prizes are just for fun. It's all about the playing the game. Let's see what Carl's come up with this week. This is his last chance. If I ever heard anything like New odor again, that's the end. They did get it though, didn't they? Just have the jingle again. All right. Oh, Rockbusters. Right. If you haven't heard it before cryptic clues that make up a band and some initials to help you on your way as well. So. Well, you'd never get it without. But go on.

Excellent forthcoming single from the White Stripes. I just don't know what to do with myself. Worth checking out the webcam. Ricky's made Carl. Some kind of. I don't. How would you describe that? I don't know. It's like a new thing. It's sort of like a scarf sort of bandana. I just invented it. I don't know what. Talk us through it, if you would. Well, all it is, it's. It's a length of toilet paper. You can use silk, whatever thing, and you just put it around his neck and then round the back and up over the ears and tied to a little bow jauntily on the side. If you could actually stand up just in case they got a webcam shot of it. You can. You can see that there. What would you call that? I don't know. It's sort of like a bandana, but I don't know. Necadana neck chief. A car chief? Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Well, we'll be marketing those if anyone's listening, so. And would you do them in a Variety of different colors for gay people. XFM. Red Hot Chili Peppers. Universally speaking on XFM 104.9. Well, halfway through, Steve. I'm Ricky Gervais. That was Mr. Merchant I was referring to there as Steve. Familiar friends by now. Five years in the making. Carl Pilkington. I know him a year and a half, but he's a good friend as well. All right, xfm. Where paths cross. All right. Oh. So, any interesting things to Talk about, guys? Dr. Fox style? Any amusing observations? Have you taken a sideways look at the week's news or anything? Carl, what have you? So I did here last night. Go on, go on. Five Live. You do, like, a review of what's going on in the week when we've been busy in the week. I haven't always got time to. To follow what's going on in the world. Sure. Someone's made a chicken with teeth. For what reason? Don't know. Because they can. Just because they can. So it chooses food. Yeah. They had a few guests saying, well, you know, where will it all end? I saw you. You sure you weren't watching a Wallace and Gromit video? No, seriously. Right. They're doing it. They're chicken with teeth. Why would they spend millions? What do you mean they've got a chicken with teeth? What the. What do you mean there's a chicken with teeth? Sounds mad, doesn't it? What are you talking about, Carl? That's what they've done. Do you know, like, why? I don't know. He's just messing with science and that. And that's what the people were saying. What? Why are you doing that? Do you know what I mean? Where. Where will it start? What's the next thing. They did the sheep. They did the cloning. Right. The rat with an ear on its back did that. Can hear a mouse, cat coming, can't it? What else were they talking about? They were talking about that sheep again. That cloning one. Yeah. Dolly the sheep. Do you think it's that clever? They do all look the same anyway. What's it got to do with its cleverness being cloned? Is it. Is it. Do you think that's a good thing he's doing? Is that impressive? Because they look the same anyway, right? They could have just put any sheep in there and go, look, they're the same. Yeah, brilliant. So there was a program. People were talking. What are you talking about? A chicken with teeth. That's. It was the latest news. It was like, all about the war and that. And I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then it's a chicken with teeth. Yeah. He didn't really about the war, did you? That was like. They might have been speaking French or just like whistles. What's. And now. Sorry about a chicken with teeth. Yeah. You stop washing up, someone can let us know, you know. Oh, God. Don't open the floodlights. No, but I'm just saying, I don't know the full thing. They're just surprise. They just touched on it. Yeah. Anyway, other stuff I did do proper research on in the week gone. Having testicles done. Having your testicles done. What does that mean? Same magazine that was doing the hanky coverage. You know what all that's about? Feels like a great magazine. How can we get him as a pundit on these new shows like Newsnight? Do you know what I mean? Scottish guy just on there, just asking what they think. Wouldn't that be amazing? Is there a producer out there that'd take a chance on Pilkington? Is Pilkington Raggy? Omar, Ian Hislop and they. A panel of people and they just ask. Ask people. Yeah, yeah. So you can have. You can have your testicles made bigger. Why would you want to do that? Well, that's what I was asking. What's the point? Well, the actual testicles. Or do they just inflate your ball bag? Because you could do that, couldn't you? You could have some air injected. So it was like a big. So they'd look bigger, but they'd rattle around inside. Wouldn't they make a little noise? Wouldn't it? When you're. Manakas, like some kind of instrument. Yeah, that was sort of one of those African instruments. It's like a big sheep's bladder with. There's Pedro on the renacas. Yeah, yeah. Just stripped strip to the waist. Yeah. Just. Yeah. With us hanging out. And then. Then when you're sort of like the neighbors would think, what's he doing? He's. He's been playing those menacas all night. And really, you would. Yeah. You know why? Why? The mouse with the ear on its back. Go and keep it down. Yeah. This is really loud to me. Hey, why would someone have that done? Then you brought it up, presumably, so that they could draw a little funny face on them. Yeah, obviously. And you could let them down after the holiday. Like you do a lila. Exactly, yeah. On holiday you're floating around, you know, like just in the sea with your big instrumental manacas. Right. Just floating. You're having a whale of a time. Like people playing it as they go past. Exactly. All right, Carl, all right. Become a bit of a sort of local celebrity. Yeah. There's Carl with his floating manaka. It's like a big jellyfish. Right. Yeah. And then the end of the holiday or Saturday, if you've got a little. Pair of tight Speedos, he'll be like, Jordan walking around and then he's like, just let him down when he comes. Down for the plane. Yeah. Because they. Apparently they do. They do get bigger, don't they, as you get older when you're an old fella. No, I think I get lower. I think that's it, that testicles and breasts get lower. Is that purely gravity? I think so, yeah. Probably stretching a bit in it. So is it wear and tear? Is the old fellas who are walking about saying, oh, sick of these, they. Don'T tread on them. Well, that's why old people have always got a little sit down, you know. Yeah, yeah. Stick them in the socks. Or they can have them, I suppose you can have like a little ball lift. You can have a facelift, can't you? Have a little nip and tuck or probably a facelift without, wouldn't it? Because that if you pull your face. Up, that's going to bring the skin up. Bring up a little bit. Yeah, don't go too far. You'll have a little knob as a tie, but you can, you know, you can tighten stuff up. Speak for yourself. Steve with his kipper tie. That's a lovely tie you've got there, Steve. And you look so young. Yeah. What's that little sack underneath it, that little brooch? Well, wait. Playing with your little manakas all night, girl. So a chicken with teeth and you can have your balls done. That's Imagine. Imagine Kirsty Ward, whatever her name is, on News Night saying that. And now, two features of the week. The war in Iraq. Let's forget that. Who wants their knackers down? Look at this chicken carefully. Bite. I think we should send this link to Dr. Fox and see. See if he thinks it's an improvement on what he heard during the service. Record player. Record, yeah. Get this link, send it to Dr. Fox, he'd love it. All right. Plus he'd be offer. Able to offer some kind of medical explanation. Yeah, exactly. Teenage Fan. One of Kurt Cobain's favorite bands, apparently. Teenage Fan Club. And that was the song Radio. He loved them. We've just had a. An email here. It says apparently the. They created the chicken with the teeth in order to prove that DNA can be reverse stimulated the theory being that if you can revert chickens to a state in which it has teeth, I don't know if it ever had teeth, you can alter someone's DNA to stop them going bold. Carl did that. Does they mean that because birds came from reptiles that had teeth outcrops and then changed into a beak or whatever, that they revert? I don't understand the revert DNA. I mean, there's not. Not quite enough science here for me to be able to answer it in detail. Not for us, maybe. I think Carl's probably grasping. What do you think that means? Yeah, What. What does he say? Okay, moving on. Oh, dear. Oh, life's too short. What else is that? You got monkey news coming up soon. Like I say, it's been a struggle. We'll. We'll. We'll do that. We'll do Cheeky Freak of the Week. Do you wanna. Oh, definitely. Should we do Cheeky Freak? I can't wait. I'll always do these. I'd start off with these. All right, well, let's have the jingle for Cheeky Freak of the Week. Oh, no. Do you remember it? No, I remember it. Oh. Oh, Cheeky Freak of the Week. Brilliant. Something like that. I want some more, though, because that was slightly halfway. Oh, Cheeky Freak of the Week. Excellent. Right, this. We're going back again. Yeah. 17th century. Well, it was. It was 1829. Right. Oh, I'm impressed. Now, the problem is with Cheeky Freak. Of the Week, not so much the week, is it? If you're going back to 1829. Well, not even of the century. You haven't even done Cheeky Freak of the Century. There's. What's the problem with Cheeky Freak of the Week? Just because. Other than the sort of moral implications. Yeah, yeah. Well, last week it was a fellow with two heads. Yeah. We've done Siamese twins. It's time in these twins again. It wasn't a fellow with two heads last week. It was Siamese twins. Conjoined twins. Sorry. They're two different people. This is what I'm telling you. But this is the problem. They're going to crop up quite a lot just because they've got double a chance. All right? Oh, please don't write in and complain. He knows not what he does. You understand, don't you? Carl will actually feature one day in this section, so. Right, we're going back to 1829. Yeah, all the way back there to 1829. Retro conjoined twin link. A couple of guys set up a business. They Were called Chang and Angel. Oh, they're the first. That's why they're called Chinese twins, because they weren't. Wasn't that what it was based on, those two, Chang and Ang? Was it the original? Yeah. That's why there's called Siamese twins. I think they were Siamese. So these are the first ones. Well, one of the first ones, but they're the ones that got to fame, I think. And why people started calling them the fit. Because Calling conjoined twin Siamese twins. I think I'm right there. Anyway, good. Well, the. The sort of setup business sort of going around the U.S. well, both of them. And Europe. Yeah, yeah. And what they used to do. People were amazed by it. Anyway. People wanted to know how they get through life doing certain things that. That you. That you think about. When you think about Siamese twins, you think about, you know, how do you get through a day like that? Yeah. And the thing that cropped up the most were people was how they take a bath. So they used to go on tour around the US And Europe and sit in a bath, have a wash on that. Did they ever wash each other by mistake? They go, oh, oh, that ends there. That ends there. Like those things in supermarkets. They put one of those down, we go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. That there. What do you mean? You know the things on the conveyor belt, the little. The little dividers. Yeah. They wind me up, those dividers. I. Sorry, I said a complete tangent, but I. For some reason, it's my own psychosis, but I get so annoyed if I'm in a supermarket. I've got my shopping, I'm just about to get served. And you can always see there are certain people who stand behind you getting edgy, itchy, worried that I'm not going to put the divider down to separate my shopping from theirs. It's like they're terrified that I'm somehow gonna deliberately pay for their shopping. Their onion. Yeah, well, I didn't get an onion. I'll have that. And it's just. But what annoys me is it's not so much that obviously it's a practical thing. It's the fact that they get a little bit edgy. You can actually see, certainly, kind of, dare I say it, certain breed of woman and a certain breed of fella will just get a little bit itchy, a little bit edgy. And they just. They just look at. You can just see them sweating. Especially if they can't. I just lean over and do it myself. Well, I know, but it's. The thing is that it's like they almost feel that they. They ought to wait for me to do it, as though somehow it's my obligation. And I just annoyed for some reason. It's. I know it's ludicrous, but it really annoys me. And I actually deliberately don't put the divider down just to see them sweat. I like the way that they're actually quite well made. There's some that are brass with like a felt bottom. Yeah. Like you really care. Like a twig would do, wouldn't it? But I just leave a slight gap. And then when it gets to the. When the woman's putting it through the tail or the guy, I just say, that's my stuff. Do you ever look at the people shopping and go, oh, I should have got that often. I'll tell you what it is. It's the same thing. And again, it's my psychosis when people. If you're on a bus or a train and we're pulling into the stop, but there's a good, you know, kind of 35 seconds before we're actually going to come to a halt, they leap up and they're straight by the door. Yeah. But it's this fear that something. They're gonna miss out. Oh, my God, what if I fell over now and broke my ankle? I'd never get out. To be fair, I've never had that. That commuters worry. I've never commuted. But every second counts, doesn't it, because you miss a train, it can make a difference of half an hour. So that's why commuters literally run to get their connections. But the thing is that with a bus, yeah, you, you know, there's often. You'll be people who are sat right next to the exit, will get up and stand up for a while, waiting to go. It just. Again, I'm not saying it's not. It makes perfect sense to them. It's my psychosis. They're going to be mowed down in the streets. They will just be a few of you. You're going to be in a lovely Chrysler. Exactly. Yeah. Well, I will be going straight through a branch of Waitrose. Yeah. Taking people out in the. In the. We do not condone going through Waitrose in a. Now it's changing. They're in the bath, they're washing their own bits. They've got one of those dividers, right? They go, well, that's. That's definitely yours. I marked mine. That's definitely mine. Don't wash that Chang. I won't. I wouldn't hang. I wouldn't wash that. Right, so what are they doing? They're in the bath. Carry on with the story. That's about it, really. I mean, that's. That's the. The fact that people. So two people, two little Oriental fellas joined in the hip, had a bath. No, no, that's your story. They didn't have a bath. They sort of. Everybody. They must have done some sort of research. Right. Who Changarang. Right. And they said, well, what do people want to see? Isn't that basically roller song? But it's an idea that people have queued up, they've paid them, whether they're in a tent there. Well, I hear they're gonna have a bath. They're gonna have a bath. How would they possibly do it? Well, I've heard they get into a bath, but that's. I don't know what. They wanted to see them nude and where the join was more than. How do you get in the bath? I don't know. They just. That's. That's what they picked. They said, what. What would be good to see. What. What? You know, what do you want to see him do? Having a bath. How'd you get into trousers? Was there. Essentially, this is all part of it. And that's why they picked having a bath. This is all part of it. Well, they watch me get dressed afterwards. Yeah. It was the best out of Chang and Ang. It was your favorite. They both look the same, to be honest. There's a surprise. One was a short ginger woman. Oh, dear. Is there anything you. You know what. What would be better than having a bath for you and you seeing them? What. What would sort of make you go, I wonder. One of them pulling and the other one going home alone. Yeah. Okay. After. She's definitely up for it. I'm taking over again. What am I gonna do? Can I watch? Definitely not. Definitely not. Look, you go to bed. I wanna. I wanna wine and diner. But if they're. If they. If he's got back to their place and they're going at hammer and tongs. But only so many. One of them and Tongs were their cousins. Right. They lived. They lived miles away. Yeah. If one of them gets knackered, can the other one take over? I think we play a record. That annoys me. What? That sort of being at it all night. What do you mean? Let's put a song and I'll come back. What do you mean? No, no, come on, seriously. Because. Okay, Rem. Yeah, well, after rem Night swimming, being at it all night and why it annoys Carl. Night swimming deserves a quiet night. Night Swimming by rem. Well, before we played that track, you remember, Carl was on the right of teetering, on the cusp of telling us why he's annoyed at going all night. I assume you. You mean relations? Yeah. What do you mean? What annoys you about sexual relations all night? The concept or people keep you up. Is it your next door neighbors or something? No, just. Just that thing of people who say, oh, that's it, all night last night. Who says that to you? You know, lads who think that, you know, think they're a bit of a lad and think that that means it's good. What, like Sting and his tantric sex? Yeah. Well, to be fair, it goes for eight hours, but only three minutes of that is going for it. The other sort of, you know, seven and a bit is sort of laying next to each other, isn't it? Right. Sometimes in a different room. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is that why it's called Sting? Hey? Well, if you're at it all night, it's gonna sting. So what's your problem with this notion of going at it all night? It's just that thing of, you know, get it done right the first time. Do you know what I mean? Get it done? Yeah, get in, get out. Like the sas, Once you've done it, you've done. You know what I mean? Yeah. No funny around, no messing about. So, yeah, it's just that, isn't it? It's like, do it right the first time, once you've washed up, right, you put the pots away, you don't dirty them again. What a lovely analogy. That's one of the great. Is that what you say to Suzanne? Come on, love. Once you've washed. I've already washed up. You don't dirty the pots again. What a romantic. Hello. Is that a fire? Oh, hello. Did he have a mustache? The fireman? Radiohead. They're there on XFM 104.9. I'm looking Gervais. Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington with the answers to Rockbusters. The. The biggest quiz on radio probably. Do you want to remind us? No, no. You mean the crappiest quiz already? Yeah. All right. First one was that fella likes sucking on iron. Yeah, right. The. The initial was M. What was the band? It was Metal Liquor. All right. No, wait, wait. I've never heard of a band. Metal Liquor. Metallica. Yeah. You said Metal Liquor. I don't understand. Yeah, Metal Liquor. Metallica. What now? Say again. Say again. And try and make Metallica sound like metal liquor. Metallica. Metallica. Metallica. Is he having a fit? Say it again. Make Metallica sound like metal liquor. Metallica. Metal liquor. Okay, next one. Second one. The Jamaican fella spots a boat. That was easy. That was D. That was Divage. You got that? Make it sound like the band DeBarge. Make it sound like a Jamaican fella saying spot in a boat. DeBarge. All right, so you've got that one, the last one. Draw a game of tug of war. Well, it's up to you. You own it. Right, that was E. That was your rope. Europe. Europe. Right, who did the final countdown? Yeah. So that's the. What? We've let that go. That's the three answers for this week. Who's the winner? Steve? Well, again, I mean, there are lots and lots of people who got it right, Rick. So I don't know if it's just us that think this is rubbish, but who's the winner? Well, you know, I'm always a fan of people with just something, a name. I don't know, that maybe tickles me. And sadly, I did want to give it to. I wanted to give it to Daniel Jowett because I just. For some reason, Danny. But sadly, I just realized he got it wrong. So I'm going to give it to a different dad. So not only did you ridicule his name, he's not even getting the prices. But better luck next time, Danny Jarrett. Instead, I'm giving it to Dan Mason of Ilford. So he got them right and he wins those prizes. All right, well, okay, More of that next week. I mean, what. What do we think? We'll do it next week, then. Yeah. Okay. What are you doing now? Got a record or. Not? The Hoople. Yeah, Monkey News next. Not the Hoople. Roll Away the Stone. Classic Little Ditty on XFM. 104.9. All right, play the jingle. Oh, is it. Is it brilliant. Oh, chimpanzee that. Monkey News Extra. Is there Monkey News? I'll tell you what, I've been having a bit of a problem this week. Why? It's just been a struggle. Normally I can come into work on a Monday and there'll be something that's happened over the Saturday, over the Sunday night, you know, I mean, over the weekend, the monkeys have done something. Been very quiet. I thought, I'll be all right. Let's see how the week goes on. I don't know if they've caught on to the fact that we're giving this coverage now or. I, I don't, I don't understand. Normally people are emailing me stuff all the time about monkeys. Been very quite weak. I've been checking. I was looking in books last night and stuff. So is there any monkey news? I, I've, I've got some, but just because it's not that good. Something else I found out that I thought I'd share with you. Go on. I was looking in the Guinness Book of Records, right, Because I thought they'll have something in there about monkeys or something, right. And there's a little monkey, I think it lives in Asia, right. There's loads of them live in Asia. Might just be traveling, but. Yeah. And something they found out. I don't know if they've got it right and that's why I want to bring it up. Apparently it's the mammal, right, that's got sort of the, the pointiest eyes. Eyes that pop out in the red. Steve. The thing is, right, I thought that's interesting. Yeah. Apparently it's the biggest with the sort of goggle eye type thing. Right? Yeah, go on. Apparently they, they come out of their head 1.6 cm. 1.6 cm? What do you mean they protrude? Yeah. The truth on the head at 1.6. Okay. How long have you got a ruler? Right. 1.1.6. I'll tell you, I'd be a little bit annoyed if the monkeys beat me. Well, I don't think it has. That's what I'm hoping. Is there anything we can. I mean, what's 1.6? Can you. It's about drop your trousers. It's well, oh, about three quarters of an inch. What do you think? I don't know. Have they got it right or what? Maybe I should come down to Monkey World with you next week. So anyway, so that's, that's not the monkey news. That's just something that cropped up and. Sure, I do know once when we were playing Paul in the office, I think Lucy was your partner. Yeah, it was me and Ash versus you and Lucy. And then you were having trouble because his glasses kept slipping down. So Lucy pushed his glasses up his nose, but the glasses touched his eye. Do you remember that? Yeah. He started it. He started it. We are the one who joined in. I know and I feel, I feel bad now. Yeah, he makes me nervous when he goes. Yeah, it's like play record. No, I'm just trying to think about which part of your fat middle aged physique I can pick on the tits. Would be a good. Yeah, yeah. Oh, the belly, sure. Oh, what do you think of that? Oh, that, that's. What is that? Play a record. Is that monkey news for this week? Have we not got any other monkey news? Well, it's just. It hasn't been that good. I mean, the one that I found out here, because we've covered so much in the monkey world, right. The fact that we've done a monkey that was a sort of half man. We've done a monkey that got a. Got a decent job in a train station. Can you think of any of the other. Well, that's just some of the great monkey news from the past. That's what I mean. So that's what you got to compete with. So even though this is quite amazing. Just tell us. I know the monkeys got married. Oh, not another monkey getting married. What do you mean? It's got another one. You know, it was knocking about with some woman monkey for a bit. A woman monkey. They decided to, you know, get married. Yeah, they did. What do you mean they decided to get married? Was it pressure from her parents? They had a. They had a good do and. I love the spread. I love that. Just peanut volavons. Yeah. Celebrated in a pub and then they both went off to the cage at night. That's. That's what I mean. Even though that is quite impressive because. Not true or it's a joke. It's nothing. It's not on an over website. Official sort of news website. Two monkeys have married in Romania after a whirlwind romance. Well, that's after a whirlwind romance. Yeah. Yeah. A quick one. Hanging onto the rope. Yeah. She was in the tire. Yeah. He saw it. Yeah. He went, I'll have a go at that. They go, we got a Maria now. Yeah. Her parents came and said, do you just. Did you just sh. He was in a zoo knocking one off. She went, I can do that for you. Yeah, yeah. Gu. Say the monkey bridegroom was scared by the number of people attending the wedding and refused to get out his cage. Not bloody hello. Magazine again. No, it was. No, I think it was like last minute nerves. Right. Like, you know, I'm single now. It's like, you know, it's the big step. Yeah. But his bride enjoyed every minute of it. She was loving it. She looked lovely, by the way. She looked lovely. Did she have good reports? She only appeared to have problems with her violin dress. Do you see? You know, this is the guest. I hope they didn't Ruin it like Anthea Turner and maybe get sort of sponsorship, PG tips or something with strong plum brandy. So they got them drunk as well. So they carried on the celebrations at the pub and the bride was taken to her new husband's cage at night. I, I really. Well, I apologize. Play record. I'll tell you what winds me up. What? Monkeys getting married. I know. And I'm not getting any action. And I got bigger eyes. Little by little. Oasis on XFM 104.9. Well, that's the show. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilgrim. Carl, it was a good show today. It's all right. When it was some. What is it? What do you think the, the, the. The loyal listener has gotten from today's show? What do you think? What do you think that, you know, we've added to the world? Well, I think. I think they know what they've got. Right. But if someone's just tuned in, I can tell them they've missed out on some. Some good stuff. They've missed out on Chang and Ang. Yeah, they're the, they're the two who are the one. The ones who invented, you know, the Siamese twin thing. Yeah, that's it. They invented it. Yeah. You've got. You've had, like. I would spend our last day running people over chicken with teeth. Oh, he says it like, you know, there's no other show that could give you all this. Yeah, go on, Gay Ankis. We've done that. Yeah. No one will be having a problem there tonight. Yeah. Another monkey marriage. It sounds like the end of the news. Yeah. You know, I mean, the headlines on Sky News and headlines and. And another monkey marriage in Romania. If you've thought about having your testicles bigger. Yeah, you sort of covered that. Yeah. And the monkey that had big eyes. If it's listening, you know, his position might not be safe in the Guinness Book of Records. And, and of course, Carl stays hard by looking at firemen. Indeed. We've also learned that. Well, that's, that's not. That's not true. Well, you did. All we know is that you saw a fireman and nothing. See, it didn't seem to affect your erection. We avoided saying erection. If anything, it prolonged it. From what. We've avoided saying erection for two hours and then he just, you know, healthy young man. Yeah, no, sure. I'm sure he was. I'm sure he was, but firemen keep Carl hard. Amy, man, to end with.",
