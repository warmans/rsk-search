  "text": "Foo Fighters all My Life on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais, with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Indeed, Genius Carl Pilkington, as Heat magazine said. Really? Is that what you refer to now? Yeah, yeah. Genius saying about people tuning just to hear his games, such as Educating Ricky. Have you got some Educating Ricky for me? I need some education, Carl. I desperately need some education. I want to learn about Chinese kids that are born hairier than average. I want to hear about deaf girls that can hear after their mum hits their head against the wall. These are the things I need to know. I mean, I don't wish to be disrespectful. He doesn't look like a genius. He doesn't look like genius. But then I don't know what a. Genius looks like exactly. So I don't want to be. Look at Einstein. Yeah, yeah. His mum thought he was mental as a child. Where'd you get that information from? That was in the Einstein. In the Einstein book. Then it's really true. Which Einstein book is that? The Big Book of Einstein stuff. Oh, yeah, yeah. The big bumper Book of Einstein stuff. It's a coach trip and you have to fill in the equals. MC one squared, two fish or three. Hello. And then it's multiple choice and you feel it's great. Did his mum think A, he was a genius? Some. Most people go for A, but it is, in fact, B, she thought he was mental the age of 28. Oh, Carl, you never let me down. You never, never let me down. So have you got Educated Ricky for me? Educating Ricky coming up. You've got Rockbusters. We've got Rockbusters as seen and talked about in Heat. It's got really tough this week now we're not messing about anymore, right? Got some good prizes. Absolutely, yeah. We'll talk about those later. Yeah. Because, I mean, was it last week that you had the classic? Was it. I can't remember. I'm paraphrasing, Carl, apologies. Something like, I'm here in Texas, I've fallen in a puddle and my knee has got wet. Yeah, Wet knee. Houston. Whitney Houston. Whitney Houston, yeah. Also it was last week when there was a little bit of confusion over the one for Holly Valance. Of course, I don't think it was confusion. I think it was your error. Yeah, no, it wasn't. And it was Holy valance, and you meant pelmet. Ah. Then Becky, who called up that time and said, oh, if you. You get mistaken with pelmet. Right. She Sent me an email in a week saying, I've done a bit of research, it was my fault, I've made an error. It is a valance. Okay. And I know about valances. As I told you last week at the very end, me auntie loves them. Yeah, Right. She makes them. She started off just like, putting them on top of the sort of window around the curtain. And then she thought, oh, I can do more with this. And she had a little coffee table that had magazines underneath. And she said, I'm sick of seeing them magazines when I'm sat down. She sounds like a pilkington. So. I'm sick of seeing the magazines when I sit down. So she put a valance on the table. Just got balances on everything. Then next step, she tapes everything. She never actually watches telly. She tapes it all because she gets sick of listening to the adverts and that. So she tapes everything. She's got loads of videotapes and that. And the video used to get on her nerves when she was watching a film. She'd see the clock changing. Oh. And it distracts her from the film. So she put a valance. That's genius. Or is it mental? Only Mrs. Einstein can tell. No. She's even made her little Jack Russell look like a hovercraft. It's great. So everything's got a balance. If you go round and you stand still for too long, the chances are. This is the. This is Auntie. Who? Auntie Nora. And this is the one that farted for five minutes, lest our listeners forget. Farted for five minutes. Called his mum. Say I'm farting two minutes into the fart. She said, about two and a half minutes in. She said, I'm about two and a half minutes in. Mum said, how long going on for? She said, well, it was about 2 1/2 minutes before I called you. Yeah. And then it went on for a further two, two and a half minutes or something. And then it stopped. She could. She couldn't type. Right. Because there was a balance over the clock. Yeah. Because it used to annoy her when she was on the phone. You put her off. She was guessing. It was five minutes. This was one consistent fire. Yeah. I mean, it wasn't making a noise. It was just. Oh, it wasn't making a noise. Just gas. Endless gas. That's fantastic. Well, we started off with a new one. Little bit of Foo Fighters. We like new and old on this show, don't we? We like to mix it up. I'd like to play to the Smiths from their. From their debut album. I don't owe you anything I don't owe you anything. The lads from Carl's hometown. Indeed. The Smiths. Brilliant, that one. Wow. I went to Manchester, didn't I, the other day? Went up to Manchester for a little corporate. It was all right. He went, wait till you get out. You see, because it's better than Houston, Right. It was, you know, it was. It was nicer. I went outside and there was a ridiculous queue and sort of one cab, right, yeah. So horse drawn. Yeah. And so I walked and it was okay. It was only down the road a bit dark. It was wet and raining. Of course. I know, yeah. The hotel was very nice, but no minibar. I've never seen that before. I've traveled all over the world seeing them in the hotel without a mini bar. So I don't know what's going on then. I thought it was going on there and then I. I did this corporate gig in Old Trafford. The pitch was out. I don't know what they were doing, but, you know. Very impressive. Big impressive. I think they're Richard's football club, aren't they, Carl? Yeah. You did a gig at where? Old Trafford. It was. It was in a function room. Oh, well, I thought it was the stadium. No, no, I'm not. I'm not that big yet. No. But I mean, you know, I can't really comment on Manchester. I do know that Liverpool was voted most important music City via Parliament, so. Carl, you're making noises while I'm talking. Yeah, but you do this all the time, trying to wind me up. And I'm not. I'm not saying Manchester's the best place in the world, but what I'm saying is there's bits of it that I really miss. Yeah. Like last Sunday, right, when I'd met up with Ricky, we had Spaghetti's, which was all right. And then I said. I said, I need some soil. Damn, I wish you'd invited me. It sounds amazing. So they need some soil. What do you think? You need some more soil. Soil, Yeah. I need to repot a plant. Right, yeah. So you need to repot a plant. Yeah, fair enough. So I'm like, where. Where? You can't see these shops in London. I mean, there's nothing. I took him straight to one in my street. Yeah, but near your street, and that's probably the only one in London. Wow, you say that, Carl. No, it does annoy me around my way. It's like, you know, you can't move for soil. Shops there's earth. You can just pick up handfuls walking down the street. Incredible. People just lean over into someone's front garden. No, you can take the plants as well. No, what I'm saying is Manchester, there's loads of decent hardware shops. Yeah. Here, you know, if you're a panini in a latte or whatever, you can't move from. But for soil, I had to go virtually how many miles away from me to carry that soil home and stuff. Yeah. It's not good. I mean, London's all right, but if. If cities were sort of mulched. It's neglecting the peat market, really. Well, there's barely. I mean, there's barely any mulch available in central London. I'm sick and tired of not getting a good, decent compost of a Sunday. Indeed. So, you know, I'm thinking of moving to the north where there is loads of soil and gravel and animal shite. Whatever. Yeah. So, sorry, you were going to say, if you're marking Cities out of 10, what would you give London? Well, if you're marking them on, like, you know, on. On what they have. Right. As opposed to what? Well, as opposed to. How do you spell it? Say, like, I think the greatest city in the world is Rome. It's pretty amazing. Yeah. Have you been? What? Yeah. Why do you think that, though? Just because, like, you turn a corner and there's something there that's really old. Right. Like you're going down Normal street in. A Derby and Joan club. Yeah. No, no, no, but. But it's like you're going down the road and then you turn a corner and like, the Colosseum's in the middle of a. Like a busy road. What's that doing there? Yeah, yeah. And just when you think there's no more, you turn another corner. It's almost as if that was there first. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. But you know what I mean, London. Yeah. What have we got? You know, Trafalgar Square is world, sort of world known. And you go there. What's that? Yeah. Do you know what I mean? So there's a lot of space there. Get one big B and Q intra square to cater for the whole of people who live sort of central London. Ish. Yeah, yeah. And then I'd be happy. But what I'm saying, what would Nelson? Just popping up through the middle because you can still see it, couldn't you? Yeah, yeah. It's a great idea. So B and Q could be like the whole sort of flat thing and make it sort of gray. So it looked like rock. And then Nelson. Make it classy is what you're saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Stone clad it so it looks like you've made an effort. And then you can pop in and you can go out and go, look, Nelson's column. Oh, look at that. Isn't Nelson. Oh, look at that. The victory defeat us. Fantastic. One of the greatest living. I need some nails. Yeah, Perfect killing. Two bridges, one stone, you say? But why don't. Why isn't there more than. More than them shops? Because when I went into yours, every time I've been in there, I've been in there twice now. The first time was to get a shower head. Right, right. And I went in there, couldn't resist buying something else. I ended up getting some super glue as well. Hey, big spender. And then last Sunday we went in there, got two bags of soil. Not one. I bought two. And I bought some scissors to cut plants with. Secretaires. Well, you don't. You never know when you want. You know, you might need more soil, I suppose. Well, I've got stocked up now. Where'd you keep it? Under your bed? Sorry. This isn't going out, is it, this conversation? It's not going out on air. I got a feeling it might be. You're joking. We better play a record. Okay. Play a classic. Yeah. I hate to say I told you so on XFM 104.9. I'm looking Gervais, obviously. With me, Steve Merchant and Carl Genius Pilkington. Absolutely. I was watching Carl the Brain Pilkington, the Brain Brains. I was watching a bit TV last night, Rick, go on. And I had a little Need. No, I didn't watch Children Need. I think it was last night. It was a bit earlier. A little thoughtful lads that might be out tonight, you know, on the. On the rise. Yeah. Maybe they get a little bit success with the ladies. Yeah. This was something that struck me as I was watching it. A lot of gentlemen, you know, when they're. When they're engaged in, you know, an act of, you know, relations with a lady, they like to sort of, you know, think of an image or something that will prevent them from. You know, and you get. You catch my drift. We're men in the world. Grandmother's funeral is a cliche, isn't it? Exactly. And I'll tell you what, I think it should be Rick Waller, jogging. I was watching Fit Club. I have never seen anything. I like it when Harvey lost it with him. Oh, man alive. I mean, I. I know I slag him off, but I do. I don't really like him either. I just think he comes across appallingly and I think, you know when he. Just walked away with that in that mid conversation talking to that bloke. They're doing it for his good really. But he's, he's, he's how. He's like 31 stone. I think he lost a bit. I think he's 29 now. Don't exaggerate, Steve, you're making sound like a fat. But. But, you know, I mean, yeah, I. Was close, wasn't it? When having sex, you know, apparently thinking of Rick Waller helps. Oh, don't look what's happened. Oh, no. Me and Carl. If you're with a lady. If you're with a lady. Apparently that works. I know he's out now, Eddie. He's out. Did he walk out? I think so. I think that's it. From what I can. No, no, I think next week they kick him out because I read something about to get rid of him next week because of his attitude and first time I read it I thought he'd actually ate someone's hat. But it was me got rid of him. Cuz then he has to eat you. Oh, everything you think of now is puns. You can't get puns out of your head, can you? Oh, Carl, you're great. Look at his little face. He's. So how long have you been working on that? You got to love. You've got to give him that. That was a real joke. Look at his face. He knew it was funny. It was meant to be funny. He said it to me funny and it was well done. Well done. I'm just interested. I just want to dissect it because it was brilliant and I'm wondering, how long have you been working on it? About two weeks. Good stuff. It was worth the wait. Can I go on now? Well done. The Hattie Tune. Well, I don't think there's only one band that can top that. Another band from Manchester. Oasis. Vines. Ms. Jackson on XFM 104.9. I'm a Gervais. Steve Merchant. Carl Pilkington. Right, getting towards that time where Carl really kicks into action. We've got the quiz. We've got Rockbusters. The quiz that's a bit like Blockbusters, but mainly around music. Yeah, And a pun scenario based in wordplay by Carl. You know how good he is at that. Can I tell you what the prizes are this week because they're worth playing for? Please do. Okay. We got on DVD the Manic Street Preacher's Greatest Hits on dvd. The videos, I'm assuming. The film Human Traffic. It's a remix DVD version of that. I think we were giving this away last week. You've obviously got a bulk stock of these. Groove Armada's Love Box. An album from them. The best air guitar album in the world ever. That's got the likes of Queen, Adams, Palmer, Leopard Idol. I don't see any. I think the Smith should be on there. We got Purple Wolf, Cooper, Top Flo and back Nickelback. There was another. There was another one around, actually. I seem to have lost one of the prizes. Oh, here we are. This is. You might see this advertised on tv. The Best Bands Ever album. And just. Just imagine who this is aimed at. It's got Oasis on their Nickelback, Coldplay, the Dandy Warhol's Bohemian like you in brackets. As featured in the Vodafone TV ads. Smash Mouth Walking on the sun. As featured in the Ford Fiesta TV ads. It's for people who didn't know they liked indie. Exactly, Exactly. I don't like India. But you do. Do you like this advert? Yeah. Do you like this advert? Yeah. Well, you like Indy, then? I do. I love Indy. Can't believe it. That's great. The Mock Turtles. Can you dig it? As featured in the Vodevone TV ads. I really like Indy. Do you love the T Mobile TV ad? Yeah, you'll. It's got Royce cup on there, which is. So. So that's. That's. That's. That meet an album for people who don't like music. That's great. That's coming up. Rockbusters. But I also have a movie because, you know, last week I gave away Executive Decision. Yeah, that was on TV last night. Yeah, you didn't receive my copy, but. But they probably watched it before. A few days ago, he was clearing out. Rick. Last night I found another one, which might be just to entice people. Go on. What is it? It's coming out the bag. The Pelican Brief. Oh, another arbitrary film choice on vhs. Pelican Brief. Roberts Washington, you know, get it now on VHS. VHS is around. It was 6.99. I'm giving that away. That's great. And that's his personal collection. That's from my personal collection. Did you see that picture, Carl? I don't think it's even rewound from when I watched it. Really? No, it's not. You can rewind that yourself. Brilliant. That's a little touch. Of Steve Match in there. Exactly. Did you see that picture that you brought in? I have actually. Can I see it again, Carl? Yeah. This is a picture of. This is. You carry it with you. Do you know what? He found it last week I was. Sorting it because I'm moving. I'm sorting all me files out on that and because this is the only school picture. He had one school picture taken when he was that 10 in 1981. I was about 8. Okay, tell the story. Why is that the only school picture I'd taken? Just because. No, I had them all. I was always had them taken. Right. But my dad thought they were overpriced for what you get. Because really he said the whole idea of a good picture is like not only the person that's in it but like the surroundings. So like if you're on holiday it'll look at me and they'll go, oh yeah, you're looking well, what's that hill in the background or something like that. Whereas with. That's Rick Waller, catch it up. But all you get on these school pictures is like a blue background in it. So it was like, I'm not paying for that. Sure. And it was a big one. You get a bigger one than that. But that's just like a little passport size, isn't it? Yeah, yeah. That was £1 60. He wasn't really happy paying that because he said you could get like some done from True Print for were a. Lot cheap he could take himself. Yeah. So and so did he tell you at the time that was the last time he was playing for a school. He said, I'll get you one because it's good to have a picture of you at school. Yeah. Because they hardly ever went and all that. What's that in the background? That's my school dad. I don't recognize it. You got any interesting stories about it? Not really. So I was good looking kid there, weren't I? What are you doing with your mouth though, Carl? It looks like you're sort of. It looks like a bit like you're a ventriloquist dummy. What do you mean? Well, it looks like you're sort of scrunching your mouth up or piercing your lips or something. Do you not think? I mean now you've got, dare I say it, very kissable lips. Look how thin they are. Look at those little thin lips. It's like you. I'm smiling. That's a smile. That's what. I didn't recognize that either. Is that what you look like when you Smile. Oh. Oh. What's happening with the head? Has your dad seen you smile before, then? Well, I think that's why he wanted to buy one as well. That's like. So he can remember what it was like. Right. When did you stop smiling? When did you. When was the last time you had fun and you slightly like happy go lucky. When. When can you remember when you had no weight of the world on your shoulders? I often think that because I don't sleep like I did like when I was. When I was a kid. I had really good sleeps and now I don't. Right. So I think you've got a lot. Of things on your mind, you know, where can I buy soil? Yeah. How can I confuse a computer by tapping in Y in the search engine? Probably when I was 14, I was stress free. Were you? Yeah. When was the pipe around? Probably when I was 15. Right. That's when it started, was it? I reckon that's when I started getting stressed. Yeah. I'm just looking at the haircut you've got in the. Because obviously I've not seen you before with hair and it's an interesting mop. Did you. Do you have that done at Barbara's? No, my mum. Mum used to do it. Yeah, she cut out. Yeah. What she used to do. You can't see it in that picture, but there was one where she did a bit of a mess of it. I mean, it looks quite. I can't offer this picture. That's one of the better ones. Oh, really? Yeah. Right. Were you bullied much. On one of them? She used to, like, use a better newspaper in front of me. I. So she didn't like stick these scissors in the eyes. So newspaper stops scissors every time. Yeah. Because I think they use that for bulletproof vests. Yeah. The tough fabric of a reconstituted newspaper will stop the scissor anytime. No, definitely. I remember because I know a lot of UN guys, when they're on patrol, they use some old copies of the Sun. They put it in their pocket. Sorry. Yeah, okay. Yeah. So she. She used to. Used to always be on a Sunday night when like Songs of Praises on or something. Nothing was on the telly just before Last of My Wine or something. And she used to get the. What a depressing time that was. It was having your haircut and listening to Songs of Praise, Waiting for last Summer wine. Yeah. I always used to get depressed on Sunday nights. And it wasn't because school was the next morning, it was because the telly was so shy. I think it was because school was next morning. Because Antiques Roadshow still does that for me. I see. The Antiques Roadshow. I love it. But I'm just thinking I gotta go to school or work tomorrow. Yeah, the Roadshow. I wish they put it on the weekend. I know. I've never. I've never really had that when I worked. I suppose I work now, don't I know. Oh, not giveaway. What? Give away? Sorry, you were telling us. So anyway, so she'd get the newspaper, right? And she'd stick it in front of me eyes. And what does that say? Go on. So. So she. You inherited a lot from your mum, didn't you? So she'd cut me fringe, right? Yeah. But then she'd go, oh, it's not straight, it's not very good. So she'd go again and she'd keep going. And the problem is that what you're. Balding, I was gonna say is this, that you have got hair, but she has to get it right. It takes her to. Of your neck to get it. Even she. She sort of removed the newspaper and she was like, oh, God. I said, what? She goes, oh, I'm sorry. And like, what, did this happen every Sunday? Can I ask you, Carl, when she was cutting your hair in this picture, was. Do you think she was maybe sidetracked by an interesting article in the paper and really wasn't paying attention? Favorite hymn. Come on. Yeah. Was Rolling down the Hill in a bar. So. So yeah, I ended up with like, you know, a fringe sort of on the back of my head because she just kept going further and further. Sure, but when did you start? Barber? That was on the railway station. Must have. That's when I started work. So, you know, sort of 16, 17. And is he the one that said you have the hair of a Chinaman? He's the one, yeah. He sounds like a wise man. Well, can I just stop? Maybe we should play a tune. But maybe you could bring in some photos next week, Rick, and we can talk about them on the radio. Yeah, And I'm just gonna do a card trick, right. Take a card, any card. Yeah, right. Look at it. Is that your car? Boy with the Arab strap? Bell and Sebastian. Coming next, Educating Ricky. You too. Electrical Storm. Steve, am I mental or. We've been playing some great tunes. We've been playing some great tunes. You're not mental. Yeah. Our next FM Wonderful with an Army Gervais, would be Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl Pilkerton in the chair. Now, the. The talked about the acclaimed Educating Ricky, right? Well, just in case anyone's new doesn't normally listen, basically, I'm educating Ricky. Do a bit of research in a week, find stuff. News, history, anything that's interesting. Three stories, I give them a nice little headline. You take your pick. Between now and three, you're going to learn three things. Yeah, yeah. So the headlines are, I'll be no buying one of them. Give us that again. I'll be no buying one of them. Nice. Okay. Yeah. We've also got hippopotter news. Okay? And chicken. You believe it? Chicken. You believe it? Well, I'm your favourite part of news, right? Well, this one, it's. I'm not going to take the credit here. I heard Christian talking about this on breakfast. Right. Because it's a good, good, good story that happened, basically. I don't know if I told you about it last week when we're having our spaghetti, but I think you did. I know what it is. I know what this is. I've not heard this. Right? There's a little midget. All right. There's a circus going on somewhere. I think it was in America. Is that present day or old times? I'm talking like in the last three weeks. Okay, Right. Little midget circus, really packed out. Show people are loving it. Steve, you'll ask the same question I did. I know. So there's a little midget jumping up and down on a trampoline. That's not a circus. It looks good. Money, dessert. So everyone's clapping and he's getting carried away. Because he can't believe. He's like. He can't believe they're loving it. I didn't know they'd like a little person on a trampoline, but they love me. But you know what it's like when if there's a crowd of people sort of encouraging you to sort of go higher and stuff. And I'm sure he knew he was. He was getting out of hand, but he was jumping and he was coming down the road going higher, and he's going really high in the air, right? So he's doing this. Crowd are clapping. There's a hippo, right. Just sat next to the trampoline getting ready to come on and do his act. Oh, right. I thought he was in the audience. Getting ready to do his act. Steve, he's a ventriloquist. What do you mean? He's sitting by the trampoline waiting to do his act. Because why do they sit in the dressing room and they go, Five minutes, Mr. Muss. Five minutes, Mr. Muss. So anyway, right, so the hippos there. He's getting annoyed, Is he? Because this. Because the midget. How can I follow this? This is really annoying. They're gonna be. Oh, no. So he's thinking he's already done the trampoline. My pogo sticker is never gonna work. Yeah. Come on. So there's a hippo waiting. See, It's a great story, and I just know he embellishes it. Or it gets slightly wrong. Go on. So. So there's a midget jumping up and down. The hippo's getting annoyed. The crowd are going mad. The midget's loving it. Can't believe his luck. Although we think you think he probably knows he's dicing with danger. Yeah. Yeah. So next thing you know, they're all saying, hi. Hi. Hi. It gives it one big blind, like, heavy sort of landing on the trampoline. Goes really high, but goes off at a funny angle. Oh, hypotenuse. Okay. Yeah. And sort of flies up, flies off at a funny angle. Hippos there. Swallows him whole. Crowd are clapping, thinking that's why the hippo was waiting there. Rubbish. Rubbish. It's not rubbish, though. No. Maybe there was an accident in a circus with a midget and a hippo, but at no point was this hippo waiting to go on going, come on. The midget flew off at hypotenuse and landed in hippo's mouth and was swallowed whole. This is. This is what you embellish it. That is great. I have to say, though, Rick, when I heard midget, trampoline, hippopotamus, I was thinking, accident waiting to happen. Yeah. So maybe. I mean, you should never put those three together. Never. It's a recipe for disaster. Everyone knows that. Midget, trampoline, hippopotamus. Are you mental? You're asking for trouble. Well, you know, when he told me it, he said, and the midget. He didn't mention the hippopotamus. And he said, the midget went on and soon he fell off and the hippo ate him. And I said, sorry, what was the hippo doing there? He went, it's a circus. I've never heard of a circus having a hippo. No. What? A hippo. What can they do? You can't train them, can you? Aren't they, like, very deadly? They're huge. Aren't you? You can't out here f. In a circus. Hey, sure you're not thinking of Zippo? He's neither clown. Yeah, no. You know, and it wasn't it wasn't. It wasn't some sort where Zippo was eating a. And it's. It's some sort of horrible sexual act. No, it was definitely. I heard it on breakfast. Right. Oh, okay. Sorry. No, it's definitely funny. Yeah. Okay, good. Well, let's play a record then. I'd like to play a classic Springsteen. We're both fans of Springsteen. This might be his debut album. I'm not sure. Greetings. Raspberry Park, I think it is. Yeah. New Jersey. And this is Growing Up. It's great. It's classic Springsteen and Growing up off of Asprey park album. And. Great. They make you feel good. He's a joy. He's an absolute joy. Rockbusters. This is what they're all reading and writing about. Absolutely. Before you get the clues, let me just remind you of the prizes you're playing for. We've got the Manic Street Preachers Greatest Hits on dvd. We've got the film Human Traffic on dvd. We've got the best air guitar album too, on cd. Groove Armadas. Is this their current album? Yeah, I guess. It's not selling very well. They're still trying to promote that. You can have that as well if you are a fan of the Ford Fiesta TV ad, of the Vodafone TV adverts. You will love the. You will love. You didn't think you liked Indy. Well, you do. Exactly. And that's got Feeder and Travis and Badly Drawn Boy and all sorts on there. Plus my own copy, 6.9. Cost me the Pelican Brief, starring Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington. If you've not seen that panned and scanned on vhs. Pelican, I read the other day, that has to turn its head upside down to eat. Give us the clues. So, Rockbusters. Well, let me just explain. A bird. A bird has a gullet, an esophagus and a gullet is all in one thing. It hasn't got peristalsis, which is the movement that we have have that can make food. So a bird has to. Can only rely on gravity. So it has to have its head up and has to shake. It can't eat. You were going to say that, weren't you, Carl? Yeah. So, Rockbusters, you mentioned it earlier. One of last week's was. It's a cryptic clue and then some initials. I was in Texas. I fell in a puddle on my knees. Knees got wet. Wheel, wet knee. Houston. Yeah. That's the sort of thing we use. Of the word knee twice there in the Cryptic clue. And in the final, which is wit. So fine. Good. So there's three of them. It's email only. Ricky. Gervaisfm.co.uk sure load of stuff to win. Here we go. Right, the first one. Writing these down. Go on. Making it. The fella has only got one badge left. The fella has only got one badge left. What are the initials? That's just E. Just E.

I've got one and I, I, I, I, I'm struggling with two, but I know one of the words. But I can't think of the band that fits it unless the clue's wrong and I've got no idea where the first one is. Give us a quick recap. Number one, the fellow has only got one badge left. That's E. Second one, the unmarried lady is a friend he out with. That's md. And the last one.

Christmas. Yeah, exactly. This Christmas. I can't believe. Oh, I thank you so much for the Pelican Brief. I noticed you'd left the price on. And it's on VHS as well. Oh great. Brilliant, brilliant. So perfect Christmas gifts, isn't it? Yeah, it's great. Okay now, so that's going, that's going, that's going on. That's a big, big, big prize. It's a big weekend prize on xfm. Educating Ricky part two. Right, what's the, what's the clues left? Well, we've, we've, we've got left the headlines. I'll be no buying one of them. Yeah, and we've also got chicken. You believe it? Chican. You believe it. So they're the two that I left. Which one should go for chicken? You believe it is not that picture, is it in that, that we saw? Which picture? The bloke with it. No, no, no, no. Okay. God, that was bad. Right, okay, so just better explain that. We can't really discuss this on air, can we? Well, we can. Steve brought in Carl the best book ever, which is. What is it? I found it when I was moving house. It's an FHM publication and it's kind of like lots of grotesque pictures and stories and like the Book of the A Book of Freaks and Weirdos. And Carl opened it and the first one was like at the back. Well, you couldn't believe you luck, could you? What was it? What was, what was number 50? A bloke with two heads. And he said what's number one? Yeah. And then number six, there's a bloke who's a squid or something. Octopus. Yeah, yeah, he's loving it. At number one he said that's just a fellow under a rock. And I went, oh no, read on. I think I know about this. And it's the fella that was found. He caused a landslide while having sex with a chicken and they pulled him off and there he is, the chicken owner. So Carl could not believe his luck. So it's not that, that chicken. You believe it? I love that one. You're going for that one. Yeah. Right, well we've talked a lot on the show about. We talked a lot on the show. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. About animals without heads. We haven't. We haven't, no. We talked about cockroaches could live without a head for seven days. Yeah, we talked about that. And then of Course there was the, the well known one about the, the fellow who had his head cut off. And he blinked and he said to his mate, count how many times I blink when my head comes off. Yeah, you told it to me. You said his head came off. And he said as he said, quick, count how many times I'll blink. And it was Nick Frost. I had to go, no, Carl, no, he. He said it before I went. And that was, that was lovely. So, yeah, we've talked quite a lot about things. Heads coming off. Go on then. Well, this one, yeah, back in 1945. He looked up the date, got a specific date, mate. Jonathan sent this one. You know him as well. It's a lot at the BBC. Right. He emailed this one in, so thanks for that. Chicken. It's called Mike. There's a chicken called. Sorry, I missed a bit there. There's a chicken called Chicken called Mike. Okay, yeah. What happened was it was living on a farm, right? Loads of chickens knocking about. And the owner of the farm is like, you know, getting ready for tea and his wife says, go out and get a fresh chicken because me, my mum's coming round. So he thinks, well, I want to get a good one in because I want to impress her. Because back then, even then, they wanted to impress the mother in law on that. So they said, all right, I'll just nip out and get one. So he sees, he sees Mike Chicken running around. Is this during the war or after the war? 1945, I'd say. That was after. No, ended well, it ended in 1945. September. Gone. So Chicken's running about, he thinks, that one, look, you know, that looks all right. I love that one. He picks it up and he cuts his head off. Oh, puts it on the block. Cuts his head off. Runs about a bit like they do. He thinks it'll stop in a minute. Keeps running about, what's going on here? Right? He's now like chasing a chicken without an ad. Yeah. Saying he should die in a minute anyway. Doesn't die. Chickens walking around with no head. Lives for 18 months. Yeah. Chicken with no head. Yeah. Well, I'll tell you, I've heard this story before, Rick, and the explanation, as I understand it, was that certain vital cords, spinal cords, weren't severed when the head came off. So that was why it continued to. To live. Yeah. I don't know if that sounds plausible. It's fine, Absolutely fine. How did it take on protein and energy? The fella who owned it, he said, well, hang on a minute. He said, I could. I could kill it now, but I've. Got a wonder chicken here. But he's thinking, it must really want to live. Sure. Right. If it survives that, they sort of got something here. Yeah. So we. What he does, he gets a little eye droplet thing that he used to use on it. Obviously not, not anymore. Right. And he filled it with grain and water and it had a big hole in its neck where its head used to be. Incredibly. And he dropped. You know what, there's this. I mean, that, that is possible then if it, you know, without. Without infection, if he was taken on things. It is. It is possible. Right. Why? Why what? Why did he do it? How cruel is that? I mean, it's not cruel because it's the chicken, obviously. You know, he said, he said if. He thought it was a bit fed up, he would have killed it, he said. But he was running around quite happy. Well, it wasn't fed up at all because it had no brain. Well, what do you mean? Wow. I'm just saying. What. It was nothing. It was just. It was just sinew and nerves and electrical impulses breaking down energies. Right. That's all it was. It didn't have a brain. So it was. But I'm worried about the psychology of keeping a pet without a head. I'm worried more about what the farmer was thinking. I tell you this. What I'm. The question I'm asking is, was the mother in law impressed? I mean, that's why he said. That's what he said. This is lovely, but it's just the head where you don't kill a chicken like that all at once. I thought, we're having chicken for dinner, come and look at this running around the yard. Yeah. Oh, dear. There you go. You've learned something there. Yeah, I have learned something. Yeah. Yeah. So one more. That farmer. I've learned that farmer was very strange indeed. I have to say, to be fair to Carl, I have a feeling when I read it, the reason he kept it alive was as a novel he sold. He, you know, he got charged people to come and see the incredible headless chicken called Mike. Right. So there we are. That's great. So. Tune, Steve Tune. Yeah. I just thought I'd like to hear a little bit more from that Nerd album. We played some of this from. From there when it first came out, many, many moons ago. Since then it's gone on, it's won awards, all sorts. And obviously Nerd now, Nerd as sometimes known, kind of big producers, they're producing Justin Timberlake Britney Spears, all kinds of people. But this is a track from their album. I've heard that they are indeed. And this is called Things Are Getting Better Nerd from their album In Search of. And that's things Are Getting Better. After the break, we got more educating Ricky and the results to this week's Rockbusters. And Richard Ashcroft. Oh, dynamite. Richard Ashcroft. Check the meaning on XFM 104.9. I'm looking to buys with me Steve Merchant. Carl just remembered a little story he was excited to tell you. Okay, go on. Oh, are you going to tell him? Oh, okay. When we went into this cafe last week after Carl had got his soil, we got two big bags of soil. I was going get a bag. So I mean it was an Arkham walk home. After about 10 yards he was going on my arm it. So we had to get a cab. So we stopped in this cafe. He had spaghetti bollock. Nice. You're loving it, weren't you? It was good. It's a good little day out. And there was a woman that worked there and she sort of, I could see her sort of looking at me and she said. And then she came and said, are you off the telly? And I went, yeah, yeah. She went, yeah, Chris Miles. Oh, beautiful, beautiful. And I just laughed and we both started laughing. She went, no, sorry. I said, no, I'm not Chris, what's your name? And I went. And I had to say it. I went, Ricky Gervais. She went, oh. She went all the thing in the office. I went, yeah, yeah. No, the funny thing was she said, she went and said, oh, no, I saw you on Jonathan. Jonathan Ross. That's it, yeah. So she'd obviously watched the Jonathan Ross show thinking Chris Miles has, you know, lost his looks a bit or whatever. That's what I found funny, the fact that she must have watch thinking that. Now I saw you, I saw you the other day. Yeah, yeah. She went, oh. And then we were still sort of laughing. I was thinking, she went, I was sorry. I was going, no, it's fine, it's fine. I was thinking, imagine that. Just like great. There's not a better one to pick. That's just appalling. Oh, that was lovely. It's the second time as well that. You'Ve been mistaken for Chris Mor. Yeah, yeah. Oh man, you've got. I've had Miles. I've had Vegas a few times, Johnny. Vegas, yeah. So do you think like people are going up to Miles going, you, you do that thing about working in office. Yeah, well, don't know. I don't know whether I hope that or not. I don't know. It depends what he answers. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, I. Like, I thought you were going to say that. Are you Chris Mors? No, no. What's your name? Ricky Gerda Few. Brilliant. So, yeah, okay, right. Educating Ricky number three. Well, we've got the emails in. We've got the emails in. Yeah. People are finally. They're finally trickling in. I think people have got the full three. Right. But I mean, it's still worth emailing him because we never know who we're going to pick us away. I'll tell you what, we've still got 50 minutes before we give the prize out, so let's give this. Give them again. Just give us a quick run there because I think these are. These are. These are tantalizing. They really are. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So the first one, the fella has only got one badge left. Yeah, that's E. The second one, the unmarried lady is a friend to eat out with. M D. And the third one, I really, really love that woman. I love everything she does. That's m. Ricky Gervais.fm.co.uk you can win all kinds of prizes. Educating Ricky number three. No. 1, you've had news, you had chicken. You believe it. And the. The last one is. I'll be no buying one of them. I love that one. All right, Interesting one. This, this. I mean, I spent probably three days looking for this stuff, right? And another one that I came across, right. And I was going to use, I. Was, what a great life you've got. I was just, you know, going on the Internet and that. And I also look in magazines, found a story about a bloke who, I don't know, he was messing about with a chainsaw. I don't know the chainsaw. He was juggling a. Taking his alligator for a walk and. Go on. And his arm come off, right? Come off? What do you mean his arm come off? The chainsaw took it off. Yes. Okay. Oh, again. Oh, no. Oh. So there's a picture of him on a exercise bike, sort of just with a little stump, sort of balancing. But he's getting on with his life. He's happy and everything. Everything's fine. He's not complaining. It's his own fault. He's got no one to blame, right? So anyway, he goes to the doctors and the doctor said, I can do something there. So he goes, well, it's all right, you know, I'm getting by all right. Don't worry about it. And he goes, no, no, we've got an arm in, right, we can, we can attach that, a real arm from someone who's, I think they passed away or lost an arm or something and. They lost nothing, didn't want it back. Yeah, I love. Are you using that? No, because I know someone. Because I know a bloke, actually. Well, can't you just put this one back on? Wow. It's first come, first serve, really. I was just, I listen, I was just building a bionic man. We've replaced one arm with a robot's arm. So we got a spare one. So the doctor's going, let, let me put it on. He's like, well, all right then. So, so he does the operation, everything's fine, he's loving it. He's happy again. Because he said he can brush his teeth, right, okay. If this is, if this is gonna be so like. Because now he can brush his teeth. Right, if this is gonna be. And it was a leg or it was a chimp's arm or it was. The arm of a killer. It was, yeah, it was two left arms. Right. I'm going to kill you. Oh, let's, let's leave it then. What is it? What's the answer? No, it's not that. I'm just. Okay, right, right, so. So he says, go on and do it. So he sews it on and like I say, he's happy, he's brushing his teeth, he can have a pint in the pub, he's lifting a pint with it, all his mates are happy for him. It goes on for about two years, everything's fine, then it all starts going flaky. Oh, and you. It would. Was it made of chocolate? All right, so it all goes all like, gummy and then the army goes gammy. And it gets longer. Of course it does. So there's a picture of him, right, stood in the magazine. He stood there with his arms by his side. One arm's normal, the other one is like past his knees. It's really. He can pull his socks up without bending over. So is this going to be. They gave him, they gave him the arm of an eight year old child who would have been the tallest man in the world. No, he just said, oh, what am I going to do? And the doctor said, oh, there's not much we can do, and left it. Wait a minute, you can't leave that story, Carl, you've got to tell us the explanation. What, what was it? An incredible plastic arm, an incredible Expanding arm. Did he fight crime later? No. Well, that's the end of the story. You've got no scientific explanation as to why. That's why I didn't pay it. But you just told it to us anyway. Yeah, but I'm just saying, the sort of knowledge I come over when I'm looking for the good knowledge. Yeah. So that. Why did this arm grow? He must have had an adult arm. They couldn't have given him an arm. I don't know. I don't know. It's just one. It's rubbish again. Is it? Well, I thought. It's an interesting story, but you should have not. And it's rubbish. It didn't happen to the end. There was photos. Yeah, but you should have read to the end of the article, Carl. No, I didn't. Did. And he said, you know, he's not happy and he wishes he wouldn't have had it done and all that. And, you know, he's sure this wasn't entirely unexpected. No, seriously, he was saying, you know, his teeth are nice and clean again because he could brush him and that, but his arms getting in the way, ruining his shirts and everything. So leave that. Let's play. Let's play tune. Let's come back with the next one because I love the fact that this is like Ronnie Corbett telling one of his jokes. That wasn't even the story he was gonna tell us. That's all right, Travis Level come through quite like that on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington in the chair. We've had the. We've had the answers in. It's Rockbusters. It's the results. Carl, give us for winning answers. Right, Steve, you search for a winner. I will slip into that. So the first one was the fellas only got one badge left. I have no idea. The initial was E. Go on. Will I get the answer now? Yeah, give the answer. I think you should. That was Islastica. Yeah. Elastica. The band Elastica. I'm not sure it works. The word. The word sticker and the. And a badge are not interchangeable. And it's not his last sticker, it's Elastica. Yeah, but like Islastica. So someone's got it. Oh, so. So say a different word and it works. Oh, so if the band is Islastica, then it works. God, if only Justin would have named it different. If she just gone, let's call it Islastica, then we'd have. Yeah. Second one. What was the clue? The Unmarried lady is a friend. They eat out with God. One that's Ms. Dinner mate. Ms. Dynamite. Doesn't work. Yeah, but it's been running for four weeks. We've done. We've done the obvious. Doesn't work. Doesn't work. Miss Dinner Mate again. If she'd have called herself Miss Dinner Mate, it would work. She didn't see what. What's happening is pop stars are letting you down by naming themselves incorrectly for your clues. Those don't work. They don't count. And the last one. I really, really love that woman. I love everything she does. That was M. Yeah. That was Madonna. Yeah. Madonna. I'm gonna give you that. That work? Yeah. Right. That's the end of that feature until you can get ones that work. Okay? So you won't hear any more that. Because it's rubbish. You wrote it now already. Do you just think of the first three things that come in your mind and make them fit? Just think of three bands and make a clue and if it fits, it fits. If it doesn't, it doesn't matter. I just. I just went through again. Rubbish. It was r. Rubbish. Whatever. Right. Play a record. Hang on. We've got a winner. We have, actually. You say all this, Rick, but lots of people got them right, which. So I don't know what that proves, really. I don't know if that says, you know, you're the tosser or they're as stupid as goal one or the other. Okay. But I'm gonna give it to Simon and Daisy and Hitchin. They got the right answers and well done to them. They get the Pelican Brief and some other treats. You're right for understanding Carl Suede's new one Obsessions on XFM 104.9. Well, I'm Ricky Gervais, obviously. Steve Merchant. Carl Pilgson. Well, Carl, that's. That's about it. And we got sidetracked on the last educating rookie. You telling me about a man whose arm grew? Well, something. Something went wrong. I'm not saying it's. It grew. Just saying. What? What? The restroom shrunk? It went long. Long. It went long. What is that growing there? What do you mean it went long? Did it grow or what? Did it come loose? That's. That's what I was thinking. Oh, so it was hanging by a thread that's made it look long within the skin. It's like how you can stretch a pair of tights if something is too heavy. Arms are very much like tights. So the one. The one that we didn't get round to on Educating Ricky was. I'll be no buying one of them. Go on. Are you familiar with the. With the same white elephant something Is a white elephant? I think so. Hold on. You phoned me last night and said, what does white elephant mean? And I told you. Yeah, I know, but I know where it came from, but I just was wondering what it was about. So how. In what way is Educating Ricky. You calling me up and asking me some. Well, do you know how it came about? You've given away some of the secrets of the show there, it would appear. I didn't realize he was phoning you for information. Well, he just asked me what the term white elephant meant in sort of like colloquial. Did he say why are you interested, Carl? No reason. No, go on, go on. What? It is ages ago. So what do we understand white elephants mean? Well, some of the shoes list. It's like a bit of a, you know, you know, something that you wouldn't want around that's just stood there doing nothing. Yeah, I'm looking at you, Carl. So. So years ago when. When people used to use elephants. Years ago. Go on. When people used to use elephants. More than they do now. Right. More than they do now. This doesn't involve a midget, does it? So. So, you know, they use them in the workplace and stuff. Factories. Yeah, yeah. Security guards. Yeah. Can't trust them with the buns, though. That's why they stopped using it. Oh, God. Go on. So there was loads of. Loads of elephants knocking about. And the thing is, right, you couldn't move from. If you have a lot of something. You also have a lot of demic ones, don't you? A lot of what? You know, sort of demicky ones. Ones that aren't right. Really? Well, you know, like, they weren't. They weren't. Weren't properly. They weren't. They weren't properly. What are you doing? Right, I'm getting to the story. So what I'm telling you, they were a bit demicky. So they weren't properly. You started making words up. Yeah, you. Stanley Unwin reincarnated demicky. Yeah. There was a lot of albino elephants knocking about. Where? Where is this? Africa? Yes. Should we say Africa? Yeah, yeah. If an answer's got a question mark at the end, I might. It's either Africa or India, but I'll give you a cl. Elephants. Do they have big ears or little ears? I didn't sort of notice the side of the elephants. I noticed what I noticed is they were white because there were albino elephants. Okay, Right. So that's why the heading, I'll be. No buying one of them. Okay? So what would happen is people who didn't know what they were doing, like, you know, you get people making a mistake buying cars that are full of problems and that. Back then, when people were buying elephants, they'd go up to someone, say, I'm after an elephant. And the fellow would say, yeah, I've got one here for you. This is a nice one. And it was all white and stuff and it had, like, blue eyes. You should never trust a used elephant salesman. With blue eyes. Right. This is great. So, yeah, so a fellow who didn't know what he was doing would buy the elephant and he'd get it back and it'd be all sort of lazy and stuff and he'd say, what's. What's up with this? And his mate, who's a bit of an expert with elephants, and go, oh, where have you bought that from? And he said, oh, I got it off that fella. And he goes, oh, all this embellishing nonsense with the story. You shouldn't have bought that. So he goes, why? And he says, it's only albino, innit? And he's like, what does that mean? And he said, oh, it's. It gets tired. It's not that good at doing work and that. You shouldn't. Steals from you. But elephants back then were like a God. You know what I mean? Right. You couldn't. You couldn't say, oh, I'm sick of this, then I'm going to abandon it or anything. Because elephants were seen as, like, pretty high up on the chain of things. So they'd end up being stuck with an elephant that's an albino. Yeah. Couldn't do much. Gets tired, basically. Gets in the way. So they said. That's where they're saying, like, you know, but a bit of a white elephant there. What do you reckon, Rick? I. I feel. I don't. I feel like I. I haven't been educated. I feel like I've lost something so at a time in my life I could never get back. I feel like I've sort of been soiled and I. I don't know where to start. I'm angry. Do you know what I mean? I'm angry. Sure. Yeah, I can see that. And all that rubbish around. Look at his little face. What was all that about? A secondhand elephant salesman and his mate knew about elephants. What is it? What? They had blue eyes. What are you? Well, albinos have red eyes for a start. Oh, that's it. We've run out of time. What? What? I mean, what are you gonna do about this next week? Are you gonna actually do some educated next week? And what about Rockbusters? Are you gonna make the clues proper cryptic clues? Well, that's the teaser, and that's what we're leaving with. Will it be any good next week? Tune in and find out on XFM 104.9.",
