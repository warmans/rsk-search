  "text": "104.9 XFM. All right. This is Carl, producer of Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant. They're not about today. Ricky's on holiday. Steve couldn't be bothered. So I'm left here with all the DATs. That's a digital audio tape of all the. Of all the shows they've done since I've been here over the last, I don't know, year and a half or something. So we'll play some of the best bits. All right, so here's the first bit. I. I just wish we could maybe tape the bits we're not on air, just because that's when Carl comes into his own. Yeah, he just said to me, I was. I don't know what I was doing. I was sort of like pottering around, dancing around, doing something annoying, probably. And he just looked at me. I don't know, he was looking at me and I look back and he went, have you ever used a wife front properly? Genius. It's a great question because the answer is definitely no. Definitely. Does anyone use their wife front properly? And by that I mean get your winky out of the little sort of slot provided, as opposed to, like, put it to one side or pull them down or whatever. Has anyone used a Y front properly? I don't think I've ever done it. I don't think I've ever done it. I've never seen anyone in a toilet doing it. Rick, you should be looking. I wish I hadn't said that. I caught you. Really? Yeah. That's actually how you prove people are gay. Yeah. Get him into this conversation. Yeah, yeah, It's a trap. Yeah, it's a trap. It was the trap. I'm not gay, by the way. Yeah. You didn't prove I was gay. I double bluffed you because I knew the old gay trick. I thought it was the old gay Lord say no thing. That is another method. Yeah. There's innumerable methods of doing it. That's how Oscar Wilde was caught. Yeah. Yeah. What happened there? Well, the judge went to him. Did you see that film last night? Gaylord say no. And he went, no. And they went, take him away. Yeah, take him down to the cells. Yeah, take him to reading. It is true. Well, it originated in America. Yeah. So many of these things do. It's a brilliant point, Carl. I'd like to hear from anyone, anyone listening who's. And I mean, well, they'll just lie when they. Yeah. I don't even use sort of flies. No. Usually I sort of just sort of sort of pull my wife on my sort of tracksuit. That's why I wear sort of like elasticated waist rant all that time. Just sort of like. Yeah, yeah, you gotta get in there with the minimum of effort. Yeah, we and out. Sure, sure. Often I won't shake no to my detriment because it often leaks out a little bit later. Ever been out on a date with a girl where it's just trickled down your leg and you wish it hadn't and you're thinking, what if she gets my trousers off later? She might smell. I'll see it. What? What? What? I don't know. I don't know what I said there. Right, Rick. I had for Christmas something which I think might excite you and interest you because I know you're obsessed and interested by facts. Y Don't fill it with the microphone. Well, I was just looking at what it was underneath it. So this is a book. It's just facts and trivia. It's edited by Sir Isaac Asimov who I think's dead. So I don't know when my parents bought this book. I assume it's from a second hand shop or something. Right. But I got it for Christmas. I keep meaning to bring it in because there are generally the facts are quite sensible in here and I like to think if Isaac's been involved, they're probably substantiated. It's not like kind of just this nonsense on the web or this is probably. Or up in Greg's the Bakers that Carl gets most of his facts from. The ancient Egyptians trained baboons to wait on tables. Carl fascinated. Brilliant. That's fantastic. My point about that is why did they stop? Yeah, it's g. That's a genius idea. Would you not want to go to a restaurant where they have baboons serving? No. I'll tell you what happened. It might have been like the planet the apes and they sort of rebelled. One of them could talk, one of them could take his order and one day when it went do you want fries with that? And the bloke got really annoyed and said answering back. And then there was a. Some sort of rebellion. Right, right, right, right. The part of the apes isn't true, is it? It's not. It's not documentary. Right, okay. I wonder because what I like the idea of having baboons is the fact that I reckon they're like, I have difficulty and I'm sure you do, Carl. Like working out that sort of 10, you know, on a bill. Yeah, I reckon Baboons would find that particularly hard. I reckon you could get away with under tipping them all the time. Yeah, exactly. Not leaving enough in this leg. In it. Exactly. They go away and you go, yeah, exactly. So I'd love to see some baboon restaurants. There's any restauranteurs out there. So if you do go to a restaurant and you're waiting on us, please don't order the banana daiquiri because it comes off eaten. They can't help their little selves. They really can't. They're okay with like, you know, beef and steak and chips, but there's a little bug. I go, do you. Can you imagine that, though? Baboons serving at waiting tables? It's genius. Just stop to think about that. It's absolutely incredible. Yeah, it's absolutely dynamite. Yeah. These zoos would be a lot more popular if that was like the canteen. You could go if they were serving tickets to two. Yeah. One child row. Okay. Go through there. I think they should do other things like in, you know, in the Flintstones, they used to mix cement in that. Bird'S kind of pelican. Yeah, yeah. We start doing that again because that also happened in ancient times according to the Flintstones. Yeah. Before they had proper cement mixers. That was how they did it. Definitely. Yeah. Just animal facts. I remembered one in the week there was. Do you know them two gay American men who have. Have tigers? Okay. The two gay ones. Yeah. Let's not worry about libel anymore then all. Yeah. If you shave a tiger's head. Whoa. But okay, you gotta treat that sentence with a lot more reverence than you did think what you're saying. If you shave a tiger's head. Not just his head, its whole body. If. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Yeah, so I thought you were getting weird. Go on. If you shave a tiger. Yeah, go on. It's still stripy underneath the skin. The skin. Is it like rock? It goes all the way through. Yeah. That's amazing. Where did you hear that one? That's. I remembered that. I was that drunk just shouting it in the street. I shaved a tiger. And it's still striving. Get out of here. Yeah, well, you know, a polar bear. Polar bear's skin is actually black and its fur is transparent, not white. And it gives the illusion so it gets all the radiation possible from the sun, but still camouflaged. I didn't understand that, Rick. Sorry, you lost me. If it's skin's black. A polar bear skin fur is translucent and it's translucent. So why is it white? When we. Well, it's just because the light hits. It and the sun reflects on it. Yeah. And it makes it look white. Yeah. If you look at each individual hair, it's actually translucent. So at night it would be black. Well, everything is. Is it? Yeah. Oh, not bright stuff, Rick. You've embarrassed yourself. Play a. XFM 104.9. Lovely, that one. Now, again, I broke the rules. In the week I met up with Carl, I had lunch with him and we were chatting and having a. Having a cup of tea. And it got onto. One of Carl's favorite programs was the Tales of the Unexpected. Oh, of course. And all I can think is that he's probably the only person in Britain where they were unexpected. I mean, to him, when that. That twist came and you go, gee, I can't. Yeah. Oh, God. So it was the tree that did it. I mean, he was probably the only. And we were telling all these stories of horror and he liked horror stories. And I told him this story. And I don't know if this will come across the way, but I told him this story. It was. It was a short. It was a horror short. This was a film you saw, was it? Yeah, yeah. And what it was, it started off just had been a car crash. This is a horrendous wreck. And you saw it from the point of view of the person in the car. And he was calling for his mate. And he was going, dave. And he sort of. He sort of looked over and saw a body without a head that had been thrown at you. Oh, no. Dave, Dave. And then into the field of view came Dave, his mate, and looked at him with a look of horror. And then it sort of went black and you realize that he was just ahead and it had been his body. Wow. Right. Yeah. And I said. Then it came up at the end, at the executions and the French Revolution. People experience consciousness for. You know. And he went. He went, oh, no. He said, you wouldn't. It wouldn't be for that long. And then he went, if it was a chicken, it would work. Imagine remaking that film. But it's two chickens in horrendous car crash. Their own fault for driving. It would work. No, no, he wasn't having that. No, it was too long. I think he said, how long was this film went about five minutes. He went, no, it would work if it was a chicken. I like the way that Carly. And something like when you relate an incident like that, he's appalled and offended and annoyed by the people that made it, even though he's never seen it. Oh, he's getting. He's annoyed. Yeah. Do you have a favorite Tales of the Unexpected, one that you remember particularly, that shook you up? Yeah. We were talking about the one on where there's some woman in prison. Have you seen that one? No, I can't remember them. All right, this woman's in prison, yeah. And she gets a bit friendly with the guy who takes the dead bodies out, right? And he says, I can get you out of here. So what you got to do, right, you've got to. I don't know, at midnight when you. Hear the bow toll, that means there's a bit of. Yeah, a dead body. Yeah, there's been a dead body. So what you got to do is go into, like, the place where all the dead bodies are getting the first coffin on the right, and then I'll come along and carry you out and you can run away and escape. Yeah, Right. So she goes, yeah, all right, then. So she is the Belgian. No, I'll. I'll bury you, right? And then I'll come. I'll come back later and dig you up, right? Yeah, but that's the point. It doesn't matter. It does matter. Trust me, Carl, it really matters. Listen, I don't know if I'm going to ruin this for people at home. Yeah, Can I just skip to the end? I would imagine that she gets buried and he doesn't come back and she has to get married. Better than that. So she gets in the coffin and she's lying there for ages. She's buried. Feel a bit of movement going on. So she's obviously, you know, being carried somewhere. So she's thinking, this is it, I'm getting out. And she's lying there for ages and thinking, why ain't someone coming and lifting the lid off this? Do you know what I mean? Letting me get out. So she's really bored, she gets a lighter out, right, Lights it to have a look at who she's lying on. It's only the fella who said she'd it help escape. Oh, how bad is that? That is. How bad is that? So it is quite important that she's buried alive then, isn't it? In retrospect, you realize that the jeopardy is that she's buried alive and can't get out. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Makes it so much worse, doesn't it, than just like lying in the morgue and going, actually, I'm getting out of here. Yeah, this isn't gonna work. Look at Carl's face. Having told that he's so pleased. His face is lit up, he's beaming like a child. Is that your favorite horror thing ever? What was that one you told me about with the, with the pawn? That was a good one. Oh, this was fantastic. Right, right. There was this, there was this. Sorry, can I just check? Now we're just remembering classic episodes of the Tales. No, this is, this is, this is important. Well, I saw one, right. I saw one on Towers and Expect. Right, and it was this. These two gents, what they used to. They look down the obituaries and they'd blackmail the. The wife or the son of a dead eminent person, like might be a priest or a doctor. And they'd go, and they say, he bough erotic stuff from us before he died and he owes 100 guineas and all this sort of stuff and. And they'd pay up because it'd be so embarrassing. I just didn't want to say, just pay him, you know. And this one bloke said, who are these people? I'll meet with them. And he goes around there and he goes around and they go, your father. He goes, my father could not have bought any erotic material from you. Now he did it. He goes, he couldn't have. He's blind. Right. And that was the twist. And Carl went. So it was magazines, not videos then. Yeah. Now think about it, Steve. Is that so stupid? Well, presumably it was set in olden times because people, professional pornographers don't tend to call it, you know, erotic material. Yeah. They tend to call it, you know, juicy jugs or whatever. But more than that, I don't understand how a video is going to be any use to a blind person either. I know that you can hear the sound. Carl nodded like he caught me out. Yeah. What sound will you hear? Your meter needs looking at. Yes. Cut. What's then, what's that then? It's just noises. Occasional groans. Yeah, right. You could listen through the wall at your neighbors. He does. I mean, that's why I save a lot of money. But I thought you were going to point out, Carl, that they could have had a braille porno. Now have you thought of that? Feel the lumps on that. Exactly. Think about it, Carl. Think about it. You're excited now. Yeah. Your girlfriend's away, Carl. Yeah. The cheese GR is only under the cupboard now. She's a good looking lady. Have you ever been hated or discriminated against? I have. I've been protested and demonstrated. 104.9 XFM. Hello, I'm Carl Ricky and Ricky, Gervais and Steve aren't here, so we're. We're playing through some of the best bits. I say the best bits. It's the bits I came across first. I mean, I'm not, I'm not wasting my time. I'm. I'm a busy man, you know what I mean? So here's another bit. What do you make of the first genetically modified baby? Oh, are you worried about this? Do you know? What did they do? What. Let me see what it says here. What is it? Just choosing. Choosing the, you know, eye color. Well, this is. This is. This is the concern, isn't it, that in the future you'll be able to decide whether it's a boy or a girl. What, how intelligent it is, what it looks like. Is it handsome? Is it ugly? Obviously, no one will choose an ugly baby. And so on and so on and so on. And so it means that, you know, where will it lead? Where will it end? Carl, are you concerned? I've thought about this a lot because. What will us three look like in the future if they're being, you know, genetically modified, beautiful people? What will be we be like? How will we be considered in society? But we've talked about this before, aren't we, about the cloning thing? Yeah, that's a bit weird, but I don't think it matters because at the end of the day, right, you might look like some other kid, but it's the way you've brought that you brought up that will change your features and the way you are, you know, your personality. If you lie, you get a long nose, don't you? Well, no, but listen, right, because I remember when, when we, you know, I was growing up on this estate. This is going to be good. No, no, it's not. It's just an example of how this doesn't work, so we don't need to worry sort of thing. Sure. Okay. So growing up on this estate and there was a. There's this woman about four houses down, right. It's a bit rough. All right. Didn't fancy her? Oh, God, no. Right. But she had a baby. Well, tell me about her first. I'm interested in this woman. Why was she. It was a very like being a man. I mean, I didn't grow up in a posh house or anything. I'm not saying that if you live in a bit of a rough house, you're a bad person. What does she look like? But anyone can clean up like Tony. Green with a fag on. They didn't clean up much. Right. Oh, which even if you've not got a lot of money, you can still try and make it look nice. Yeah, right. But she didn't. And a kid used to take a horse into the house. Sorry. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah. Whoa, Neddy. Whoa, Neddy. What do you mean? A kid used to take a horse into the house when they get a horse. Must have nicked it from somewhere. Must have done. You've seen horse do it? No. What is that from outside the Saloo in the corner? Yeah. Was it just tied up with a bit of le. Oh, that's great. Big Jake for it. I've been out. So let me get this. This was before the lynching stopped or after? Where did he get a horse from? What do you mean? He must have nicked it. His mom said. Where'd you get that from? I bought it. All right, then keep it out the kitchen. I don't want you going cattling rustling. Where did he get a horse from and how long did he have it for? Was he leading it or riding it? Mom, open the door. I can't stop it. I can't stop it. Open the patio door as well. It looks like we got us a runaway. What do you mean? I don't know. But the thing is, they couldn't afford to buy one because they're not cheap. So I'm just guessing, maybe that's wrong of me, but I think he had a horse. Yeah, right. So that's why the family didn't have any money. They'd spend it on the horse. That's what I'm saying. I don't think they would have bought it. So anyway, to whisper, Carl, in case they're listening. Yeah. They could be in the room next door buying it. He's keeping it as well. So I was, like, in the car with my dad coming into the avenue, and you used to have to drive down it to turn round and, you know, sort of go back to our house. You had the traditional method of transport. Yeah. The horse was in the lounge reading a paper. Just like walking around. Oh, God. What? And when I was doing. I tried to earn myself some money once by flogging little flowers in plastic cups. What? This is genius. It just keeps coming. What do you mean you're trying to flog little flowers? What do you mean? Let's play a record. Let's play a record and come back to this. Wait a minute. So it's gonna just unravel and unravel. It's gonna go for hours. Let's play A track. We've created a whole world here where there's a man living with a horse. Just walking around the land. But I come from the West Country. I've never heard anything like that. I just think of a big sort of like orange carpet and a rediffusion telly and this horse going, I'm fed up in there. Exactly. This is really. I'm not taking the rubbish out again. Yeah, Right. Play a record. Let's have Velvet Underground. We got that lined up. Yeah. The classic from the first album, I'm Waiting for the Man. Let's come back to the horse in. A little flowers, in part. What do you mean? From that classic first album, Velvet Underground and Niko, which apparently peaked at a disappointing 171 in the US charts. Think of that. And that's obviously Louis Devil Underground and. And Waiting for the Man. Yeah. Great track. So we were talking. We're doing White Van man, and we got onto. We got onto genetically modified babies and. Somehow started telling a story about someone with a horse. And then he got onto. He was trying to make money selling flowers. Just do the flowers. Well, hang on, I just want to recap slightly. So there was a family and who had the horse in the family? It was because you lived on an estate in Manchester. So the mother. The mother was a right pig, apparently. I don't know. That's right. You don't need to go that far. But you. Well, what I'm trying to do is, like, make a picture for you so you understand. Who did she look like? Bit of a. And no disrespect to her. Bit like Pauline Quirk. Quirky. Yeah. Okay. I knew you were gonna say that. I knew it was gonna be important. Did she have any tats? I never got that close to it. Okay, so. And so who had the horse? Was this her son or her daughter? Her daughter had stolen a horse. Yeah. From. I don't know where. There was a. I think it was some stables down the road or something. And they. They kept the horse in the house with. They kept it in the house. They didn't have it for long. No. So. And you said you were in the house one day and you saw the horse. Was. I was. They did this thing at school about raising money for charity. Right. For some local charity. And they said, you can do anything to. To raise money. And they came out with all these ideas, and I thought, that's good. What was the charity? Forget. Well, I don't know. I thought, forget the charity. Yeah. That's just a good way Making your charity. So. So I asked me ma'am for some because she used to have a lot of flowers around the house. Sure. I said, can I just take some snippings off them and I'll go and buy some plastic cups and got some soil out the garden, planted the. The bits of plants in them. Yeah. Got a tray at about 25 plants on it. Selling them for 25 pence each. Excellent. You sell any? Yeah. So loads. Did you just cut. You didn't just cut them and stick them in? Yeah, survive. Oh. But I think people sort of thought, well, good on him for trying. But anyway, so I went around to theirs because I thought their house could do with a better color and stuff. Yeah. So it's a bit rough. So as I went, the horse went. Thank God for that breakfast. They've been feeding me kitty cat. So I got up to the door and they opened the door and it was one of them houses where no carpet. Yeah. A horse in the living room. You know, we've all been there. And the horse was walking around the living room. I look quite happy and everything because I always say that about. That beauty was on. Yeah. Well, think about it, right? If you were a horse, where would you rather be? In a little wooden hut with a load of hay or in like a house with a central heating, three piece suite and an Italian that tell you that? No, but I was saying this the. Other day and an Atari. Right. I was walking through London. Commodore 64. Rubbish. Exactly. Walking through London with Suzanne. Right. And you know, like homeless people always have dogs. And she said, oh, I hope, I hope she looks after it. I said, they've got. That dog is happier than most dogs. Right. Because people always walk past and give it a pat on the head. Yeah. With its owner all the time. Yeah. It's out in the open. It's not locked up in a house. Yeah. It doesn't mean. But other than that. No, he does eat, though. They're always all right. So that's what we're saying. I think this horse was. Was doing all right for himself. Well, not many horses have got their own house. Exactly. Yeah. But anyway, that's, that's, that's by the fire. Yeah. So anyway, this family who's a bit. What we were talking about, it was. About clothing, modified kids and all that stuff. Yeah. Right. Now what I'm saying is you could say, you know, right, Steve, you could have a baby. Right. And Ricky could see it and say, good, I want one that looks like that. Yeah. Right. It could Happen Rick. So come on, work with him. So you take it to the doctors and I don't know what they do, they inject it with something or whatever. Yep. That's how it's done. Yeah. And get a little baby and there it is. It looks the same. Now, the thing is, you separate, you both go off and do your own things. Yep. Right. Now you look at Stephen. This is. You look after your baby. Yeah. You treat it well, you give it good food and all the vitamins and stuff. Yeah. Ricky just gives it cheese. Right. So then it changes its looks, it goes a bit fat, you know, it gets tired easily and that sort of thing. Now when this family. Why am I just feeding a baby cheese? Right? This, this, this, this. This family had a horse in the. In, you know, in their house. Yeah, they had a. A little baby. I mean, Mum went round and said, you're not going to believe this, but it's a beautiful looking baby. Right? Yeah. And I was like, well, you know, and the weird thing is it was a good looking kid, but as time went on, they didn't really look after it. And I'm not saying like abusing it, but it used to run around. It used to play out to like 10 at night. Yeah. It used to chase cars. Right. It was a bit. Did it have hooves? Yeah. No. Chase cars. Right. What? So good. Chase's cars. Oh, God. Was it called Rover? Did he catch stick? It's Liam. It was called. Right, right. Now, the weird thing is it was a good looking kid, but as time went on and all that, like, not eating properly and its hair was all patchy. It's not Liam Gallagher, is it? And chasing cars on that and it became an ugly kid. It's definitely Liam Gallagher. That's what I'm saying. Right. You can clone all you like, but at the end of the day. Yeah, you brought up. Wow, that was a hell of a point. Oh, God. But am I right? You're always right, Carl. All right, this is Carl, the producer of Ricky Gervais and Steven Merchant on XFM 104.9. We're playing out some of the best bits. Hope you're enjoying it. Here's another one. And now it's Carl bit. It's Carl's. It's the re. Education of Carl. He's like Liza Doolittle. And now he's. He's coming. Or Lawnmower man, if you've seen that film. More like Law Merman, if you've seen the film. You know what I mean? And his homework Was to just study quotes really on. On happiness and stuff in general. Well being. He's not a big happiness quote fan eyes, Carl. Not really. So what have you done? You do come up with something, right? Yeah, I told you. Right. Because a lot of these are just things you say every day. They're nothing special. So what I'm doing what you say them every day. The sort of things you come out with and you don't even think about it. You know what I mean? Yeah. They're on the TV all the time. People on the radio are saying these sort of little quotes. Sure. And what I've done is. Remember that program on channel four? Faking it. Yeah. Where they got some like, posh kid to be on a door and all that. What I've done, I've. Imagine if that was the pitch for the show. Dear Channel 4. Just gonna get a posh kid on a door or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. TV producer. Yeah, yeah, go on. So what I've done, this little book of quotes, happiness quotes. I've. I've picked two that are real. Okay. And I've made one up. All right. And we've got a guess. And you've got a guess. Okay, then. Well, I'll tell you what, Rick, why don't we. When we've heard them, we won't confer. We'll write down yours. Yeah. A, B or C. And I'll write down mine and we'll see how. Okay, Carl, off you go. Right. And just because I'm looking at this book, it doesn't mean I'm actually reading. No, I know. Don't worry, we're clever. No, no, we know, we know. We can't see. Yeah. Like call my bluff. Yeah, go on. Eh? Nothing is worth more than this day. Okay. Yeah, all right. Yeah. The way I see it. Oh. Oh, God, my head's gonna burst. No, hang on, my head's gonna burst. No, no, this might not be cold. It might not be. How do you know? I haven't tweaked them a little bit. Yeah, good point, good point now. Good point. The way I see it, if you want the rainbow, you gotta put with the rain. Yeah, okay. All right, all right. Yeah, okay. No, it's not. Yeah. Come on. Cat food. Cat food. Go on. It stinks a bit, but if you don't put up with the smell, the little kitten will die. Steve, I don't know what to say. I don't know. What's this? Even faking it? Imagine their faces when he says that. And they're Going. Oh, my God. Oh, Carl, play a song, mate. We'll have to confer on this one. Well, that. That's just amazing, Carl. Just read them again. Two. Two were real, one was fake. Go on in. Right, first one. Nothing is worth more than this day. Excellent. Next one. What does that mean? Well, cherish, cherish now. Cherish your time. Okay. Because you. You can't get it back. And, you know, carpe die and whatever it is. Seize the day and all that. Okay. If you want the rainbow, you've got to put with the rain. Yeah, of course, yeah. Rough with the smooth, you know, it's not all plain sailing, but, you know, rainbow is beautiful, but it comes because of the rain, which you might not like. So, yeah, make the most of everything. And yeah, good cat food doesn't smell good, but if you don't put up with it, then the little kitten will die. Right. Now, Carl, that is a good effort. Now that one's yours. I mean, obviously. Right, right. No, no, but it's a good effort, right? I mean, it slipped seamlessly into the others. Yeah. Don't think it didn't. No, but it's this good. I mean, we knew it. We knew it was that one. But what I will say is it's good. But what you don't know, maybe subconsciously is. I mean, it. It. It's very similar to the putting up with a rain and the rainbow. But why do you think that? Well, what, what does mine mean? Well, well, even though it smells bad, it's good for something. Right. So I didn't look at it like that. What would you look at that I. I kind of thought was yours more. Specifically about cat food generally, because, you know, normally they like. It's an analogy. Yeah. Or for something, you know. Well, no, the way. I mean, Dolly Parton, who I think did the rainbow rain thing. She wasn't specifically concerned about weather conditions. No, it was a sort of general idea. Well, that's. That's what I've done. I've used an everyday thing. Yeah. And put it with today's problems. Right. So like my girlfriend. Yeah. She might like to go shopping for clothes. I hate it. Right. But because. Because I love her, I put up with it. Ah, that's nice. Yeah. Yeah. So you love that little curtain. You can't stand the smell of stuff. You got to feed it. But because you love it, you go, well, you know, I'll put it with this just for a few minutes and then I can, like squeeze its head later and give it a little. Sorry. Squeeze its little head. Yeah, yeah. That's just the thing that I do. Put it in a bag and drown it in a lake. I can feed it and I can. Throw it against the wall. So you didn't see it like that, did you? No. That's very good. So it's, is it. It's about putting up with the bad things for something you love. Yeah. Well, that's nice. But, Carl, you seem now to be convinced and rather smug that you've tricked us and that you fooled us and that we didn't understand it. Well, I say that's your fault, not ours. No, it's not, though. I mean, look, that man in Forrest Gump, he was a bit of a nutter and he came up with the life as a box of chocolates thing. Yeah. Now, if that was in this book, you say, oh, yeah, brilliant, you know, good bit of work. But if he was sat here doing the show with you. Yeah. You'd be taking the mickey out of him. Sometimes I feel he is. No, Carl, I could. In fact, if people are out there, we're too lazy. Could you write down everything Carl's ever said? Because I think we could publish that. Yeah. He said one today. He saw my salamander. It's not a euphemism. He saw my salamander and it's just sitting there in the tank. Your exotic pet. Yeah. And he's worried about there's not being a lid on. And he said. I went, what were you worried about? He said. He said. Well, he said it sits there for 24 hours a day, obviously planning to get out. Well, he's got nothing else on its mind. And the daft thing is, he has actually got the lid ripped up a little bit. I'll be looking up there. Yeah. It's going to get out, but what's. The worst that could happen? What's it thinking? What do you think it's thinking, this salamander? It's got its eye on the DVD player. I can have Ian be down the market. Class. I love the fact you had at least three minutes to get that right. I know. Pair and get that right. I know, but my mouth was full of Maryland cookies. Yeah. You know, last week this had. Oh, this will blow your mind. He came in, do you know what he'd bought for himself? About 10 penguins. Who buys penguins still? No. Or Wagon Wheels. Oh, I've never liked Wagon Wheels. Have you not been a fan? No, no. But I'm sorry about that. It's the Clash and Rock the Casbah. Talking about records, if I told you that time, my brother in law, he was moving out of his place, I think, moving in with my sister. And I was about, like, I don't know, 13. And so he's about 30 and I moved it. And he brought around all his records when he was storage to leave him at our house, right? And he had all these old sort of records, 50s and 60s records, right? And. And they put him upstairs and I was looking through them and it's just all like Elvis stuff and Beetle stuff. And there was a mate of mine who loved Elvis, okay? And he. Loads of chemicals. Yeah, he had loads of chemicals and I was into chemistry and he said I swapped me some chemicals for them. So I sort of nicked about five Elvis singles and I got all these chemicals and. And then the guilt just hit me. I just thought, well, he's gonna notice that. And I just. One night I just came downstairs and I confessed to my mum and she went, all right, well, I won't tell him, but you've got to be good. And it's sort of like I was just really, really good for a year. And then I remember when I was about 18, my brother was talking about it and he said, did you ever play those records I left for you? Brilliant. He told my mum, he said, these are for Ricky. She just didn't. She was sharp, wouldn't she, she. Opportunism there. Oh, that's genius. And that was it. That's. That's why I was good. But you've never, you've never stolen anything since, have you? No, I don't, I don't, I don't. Except that spate of, of shoplifting after that. To teach your mum a lesson. Yeah, yeah, well, I went round and. Arson. No, no, I did. I. I just couldn't believe it. I just. Oh, I remember. I think all kids go through a phase of shoplifting. Well. And when I was going through it, I used to just. Just little things, just like magic markers and magazines, Mars bars, that sort of thing. Yeah. And one day, right, that me mate Anthony, his mom called up my mom and said, I've got to. I've got to meet up with you. I've got to have a word with you. And she said, what about? She said, I don't want to talk about it over the phone. So she goes, all right, well, yeah, come around tonight then. So anyway, my mum sees me, she don't want to be in an awkward position and like, be a bit embarrassed and what have you, so she sees Me. And she goes, right, Anthony's mum's coming round. What have you been doing? Yeah. So I go, oh, God. I said, I've been nicking stuff. So she goes, like, what? So, not. Not big stuff. I've had a few calculators and Mars bars and stuff. How many? I just work it out. Hold on. Works out at 7.2 per day. So how many calculators do you need? So it was when that failed. You failed math, didn't you? Everyone wanted a calculator. It was like a trendy thing, wasn't it? Right. Oh, yeah, In Manchester, a couple of years ago. Yeah. So, anyway, so I told her all this to confess to Computers Will Make It There. Won't Confess Magic in the Back of battery. Go on, confess to Nick and all this stuff. She comes around, she only wanted to borrow some money. Brilliant. I don't like asking. I was a bit embarrassed to ask you over the phone, but can I borrow 20 quid? Oh, that's fantastic. And there's me. That's great. And it's similar sort of thing to yours. Did you. He went, hold on, I'm literally working out the interest on that. I bank 10%, she'll owe you £4,40. So your mum was a loan shark? Yeah. Yeah. And did. Did. Did she mention stuff with you, with that other. Yeah, because what I'm saying is, presumably you got your mate in trouble. No, no, no, that's great. Anyway, should we have some more music because. Yeah, what are you gonna play, Carl? We've got the Cooper Temple clause. Brilliant. Please. Cooper Temple. Claws. Who needs enemies? Good question, lads. Nobody. 6 FM 104.9. I'm Ricky Java. Oh, they should print a little book of those. They're great. Oh, how you can relate any song or artist to anything else. Easy, easy. Well, yeah, so me and. Me and Carl went out for a beer and it was. It was great, wasn't it? Yeah. We started off and you met my mate Robin, didn't you? Yeah. And some of the stories. Do you want to tell Steve some things about Robin? Robin. Do you know him well? Yes. Well, do you know about his. His worm problem as a kid? Go on. Right. He. What I can remember is, he. He had worms as a kid. Not sure how you get him. He never answered me. He was getting a bit touchy about it. This is like the second time I met him. I think he was a bit annoyed that Ricky told me about his problem. Now, straight away, you not being there instinctively. What do you think went on with this story? About worms. My suspicion, yeah. Is rather like when you told a group of people that Robin had once suckled milk from a cow's udder. Yeah, yeah. Did you mention that as well? Yeah, yeah. My suspicion is that, like the cow story, the worm story is not true. Why would he get so sort of uppity about it? Well, imagine. Imagine if he. That wasn't the first time he'd done it. Imagine if he did that every single time he was with somebody for the first time and Robin just met them. He tells that. He will tell that story to anyone. But they do say there's no smoke without fire. I also, I told him that the way Robin cured these worms was because the doctor told his mother, right, to hold a piece of ham or cheese near Robin's anus so the worms would come out for the food. And he believed it. I said, why, though? I said to Robin used to sit on Spam to try and get the worms out. And he believed it. But Steve, right, do you remember that story about three or four years ago where there was some bloke in the army, he went away to somewhere, Vietnam or whatever, he was messing about in the woods. Shouldn't he have been fighting, whatever? Yeah. Right. And he walked through some lake and I think he'd cut his toe or something on. On something. And some worm of some sort crawled in the. In the gash. Yeah. And it was in his body. And the doctor said, we've got to get this out of your body. So what they did was, they said, right, the thinnest part or something of your body that things can crawl through is on the top of your head. So they wrap where the skull is. So they wrapped some bacon. No, they didn't. It did. That's. So he's gone in by the toe. So what we do is, I'll tell you what, that worm's probably heading straight for the head. We put a bit of bacon on it. The thinnest part of the body is that the skull, of course, is not the thinnest part of the body. It's where your brain case is, isn't it? It's the hardest. The skull there was. There was a reason for it and it was like the. They stuck some bacon on his head. As ever, the vital piece of information, I. E. The reason Carl seems to. Have forgotten, because the worm was in. In his body. And they said every, you know, everyone likes the smell of bacon. Even. Even a Vietnamese lake worm, they. They love. Last week. Remember last week when I said about the little fella with the bow with no brain. And you were proved wrong. No, please. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We were saying it wasn't a little fella. We were saying it was a stillborn child. It wasn't a little. You're changing it now. You weren't having any of it last night. Right, hang on a minute. Let's just. I'm getting confused. There was a Vietnamese. There wasn't a village. There was a Vietnamese snake that went inside of a soldier. A little like maggot or some sort that you have to get out your body because it causes problems. Yes. And so in order to get it out of the body, they strapped bacon to his head. That is great. This doctor. And did that work? I think so. They had a picture of him smiling. Oh, what, the worm or the bloke? The bloke. Oh, honestly, I hope someone knows a story. And. Right. Just. It was about three years ago, I reckon. Okay. Yeah, it did work. GI Bacon. So this is why I. I went. The worm burrowed out of his head to get the bacon to the bacon. Right. That's great. So this is. This is why, when Robin was telling his story, I was a little bit disappointed if it wasn't true. Right. Because in a way, you know, Robin's. Never been to Vietnam. No, but what I would. Do you really think that Robin. Well, as Robin said at the time, Carl, why would I sit on ham then tell Ricky Gervais. It's a very good point. Because if he was a kid. You do daft things like that as a kid. Right. It's the telling Ricky Gervais, though. Yeah. And then. Oh, bless him. Okay. And then. Anyway, then Robin left and I tried to chase him, but he got away. And he knows that we. Yeah. And then we had a few pints and then Carl embarked on some of the greatest stories ever told. Have you. Can you tell the story about your dad? Let me run it. But I haven't spoke to him all week, so let me run it by him. Okay. Play records. You know what we got? We've got one of Steve's. Yeah. Well, bizarrely enough, this comes from the Teachers 2 soundtrack, the soundtrack to the. The current TV series. There's a slight whiff of nepotism in the air. Yeah. Rick, would you like to explain why? Well, that's why you're doing it. It, though. My girlfriend worked on it. But you were going to play this anyway? Well, I was actually, bizarrely enough, I was going to play some. I am Clute. And this is from As I say, the. The Teacher soundtrack. This is called 2U. It's a good track. That's I Am Clute. And a track called to you from the Teachers soundtrack. That's also got. I noticed the Electric Soft Parade, the Hives Star Sailor Feeder Train Break, Smoky Rev on there. It's a good little collection. Lovely. Carl has just had confirmation. He's looking smug because someone phoned up and went, it is true. It's a Lao guy Chi worm and you wrap bacon around your head. That's all the bloke knew as well. Yeah. And his name was Gary. Yeah. So I'm not having it. No. And he said. He said, see, that's why the Robin thing isn't so weird. He said. But when you said he tried it with cheese, he said, I was having none of it. He's got standards, strokes, Hard to explain. Like Carl, really. Yes, yes. So, Carl, concentrate. Yeah, go on. So we'll. We'll leave the worm with the bacon wrapped around the head, shall we? Well, if you're ever caught in the jungle. Yeah. Always carry some bit of Danish. Good advice. Lovely. So would you like to start on your. To Steve? Because I've heard all these. We won't do them all. Well, we'll start off with the. The Mr. Freeze. Tell Steve the story of Mr. Freeze. This is the first time he nearly died. This. This is the most serious of the lot, really. So what it was, do you know, like. I don't know if your mum and dad did the same thing, but, like, they do the weekly shopping on. On like a Friday. Yep. So when. When you got to Thursday, there won't be much stuff left in the cupboard. It'd just be like, you know, your Jacob's crackers and St. So when they'd. When they'd been to the supermarket and they came back, I was like, you know, what's that saying? Like a pig in. You know, I loved it. It was like, loads of food coming in, loads of biscuits. What is that saying? He nearly said pigging. Right. It's not the same. Yeah. Right. So. So, yeah, all this food comes in. Thank God he didn't. Otherwise he'd have been in trouble. That's true enough because he's. He's culpable for our actions because he's a producer, so technically that twat in charge. Right. So anyway, so there's loads of food and I'm like, oh, yeah, look at this. And chocolate biscuits and, you know, penguins and stuff. Bacon. So I'm bacon. Just in case you never know. So. So anyway, my mum. Dad's putting the food away. Me and our kid are like, he's already grabbed something, gone back upstairs. It's like feral children. It's like a quest for fire and then they run upstairs. What, did he just sit under the bed? Head gnawing at some sort of pig strotter. So. So I saw. Do you remember Mr. Freeze Pops? I do, yes. Well, they're kind of like popsicles. Icicles, yeah, but really long, like a foot long. Right. So I thought, I'll have one of them. So I grabbed it, went for the nutritious stuff first. Absolutely. And. And like my mum. Dad are pointing this stuff away and what have you, and I. I rip it open and knock it back. Right? Straight away. Just right back. But it went down the wrong way, right? So I was like, oh, God, can't breathe. And my mom and dad didn't. Didn't even know what I'd at, do you know what I mean? It went. I ate it so. So quick. Yeah. And I'm sort of tapping my mom on the back going, she's going, oh, God. You know, he's choking again. Because I was always choking, if it was one thing. I don't know if I've got, like a small throat, but, I mean, even Ricky knows I can't drink that much, can I? Yeah. Or eat pebbles. I'm not a quick drinker. I'd always. I think I'm scared of, like, swallowing stuff. Yeah. And it was like bottle tops and mint Imperials and stuff. I was always, always choking on stuff. So anyway, she's going, oh, God, what's he picked up and at. Now. Drop it, drop it. Hit his nose with a stick. So I was going, I'm choking at this point. My dad had, like. I think he'd put his. His share away, you know, his food away, and he'd go, his share, I love it. Yeah. He'd gone to watch like. Like Winner Takes all or whatever in a lounge and I. I was in the kitchen and I was starting to, like, just. I didn't care anymore. Do you know what I mean? I hadn't. I just got to that point where I wasn't struggling anymore. You just thought, I'm done. Just like falling to the ground. I mean, Mum's going, you know, getting here. I think it's serious. My dad comes in and sort of starts shouting at me, saying, that's what you get for being greedy. He didn't even know what I'd eaten. Well, it was. It was the Moment to teach you a lesson. So he's there like that and my mum's going, oh, look at him. I mean, lips were going purple, purple. And the eyes were rolling into the. Back of my head like Marilyn Manson. And so anyway, she grabbed me from behind and did that. That fireman thing, the Heimlich maneuver. Yeah. And, you know, winded me and it came up and I was all right. Well, the whole Popsicle came flying back out. You see, that's what I don't understand. Because there was nothing there. A little bit. No, it swells up, doesn't it? Because it irritated it. So you went down your. This sort of like your epiglottis. It went down the wrong way. Like it went into your air canal instead of your throat and it sort of. Sort of spasms. And that's the. That's the fear. You just got to calm it down and relax. So in time, I would have been all right. Well, no, you might have. So that's. So, so, so that's. No, but the weird thing is, like, for like, three days after that, I felt like a sort of a special person. I was. I went to school, I've done nothing. I did full days. A special needs person. Yeah. I went. I went to school the next three days after that. That. I didn't, like, wag it or anything. I did full days. I love that. Three days turnover. Exactly. After three days, you thought, screw it. Yeah. Did a quick history exam. Right, next one. That's Popsicle. That's Popsicle. Hell, we'll call that. Right, next one. Which one's the next one? Oh, what about your paper round? Right, the paper round. One paper round. I'd still say it's the best job I've ever had. And he means it. No, I really enjoyed it. It's like, you know, you don't have to work with anyone else. Right. So you make your own rules. Just think of that, you know, you. Sort of spreading information. Yeah. Giving a service and no one else is around. You know, you can just do what you want and think about stuff whilst you're cycling around on your bike. It's really good. Yeah. So. So anyway, imagine the stuff he's thinking about when he's riding around. Oh, so getting in the head of a salamander. So anyway, loved it. And even though I only got like 50p a day, right, no matter what the weather was like and stuff, I used to get up at half past four and go and do the round and why'd you get a bar pass for? Because I wanted to watch the Pink Panther at 5:30, so I wanted to get me paper round done. I said, why didn't you watch the Pink Panther? And then he went, oh, I can't sit there thinking, I've got on my paper round to do, it'll ruin it for him. Yeah. So is it a good job or not? 4:30 I was up, up and about. And this morning it was like winter, really bad winter, bad snow, you know, freezing cold, really windy and all that. And my mum said to me before I went to bed, she said, don't be getting up tomorrow, I'll give you the 50p. I said, it's not about the 50p. So, you know, people want the papers and stuff, so conscientious. So anyway, I went to bed thinking, you know, that's it, I've told her I'm still going, so, you know, whatever, go to sleep, get up in the morning and put all my kit on, on. And I used to have layers of clothing on because it was really cold. They had like a big anorak on with the fur on and like waterproof pants. And I got me paper round bag and I went downstairs to get out and tried to open the door and it was locked, so she'd locked it so I couldn't go out. So I'm searching around the house looking for the keys. She must have heard them somewhere. I thought, oh God, you know, I've got the papers to do. So I thought, how can I get out? So I went upstairs, climbed out of the bathroom window. God, right. And to try and jump out the bathroom window onto the porch. But the problem was I had so much gear, I was like the Michelin Man. So I could hardly. I could hardly move as it is. Yeah. And I'm trying to get out the window and I. I'm like trying to stretch down like that, get me foot on the. On the porch and my bag got caught on like the hook of. Do you know, like how you have a hook so you can put the window open? Right, yeah. Goes on on your bag. I got caught on that. I was holding on to the, like the, the wall and my foot on the thing so I couldn't sort of pull it, pull it away in case I pulled it away. And then fell on my head. Yeah. So I'm stuck there dangling. Dangling. My dad comes back from working nights. Yeah. He thinks I'm a burglar. Gets out his gun, so he's shouting. And stuff, going mad and going, dad, it's me. And he had to Give his hand using a. He's heard that wily trick in Manchester before. He had to help me using a washing pocket prop thing, a big stick. What did he do? Well, he said, just hold on for your dear life and I'll sort of push the paper bag off the hook. Why didn't he go upstairs and sort it out? It was at that point where I was in the middle. There was nothing you could do. Do you know what I mean? It's at that point where you've just got to make a decision. Yeah. And by the time you go upstairs, who knows what might have happened, you know, I mean, you've got to act there and then around. Yeah. So. And you could hear downstairs now. Here he is, the Pink Panther, dad. Ever so pink. Oh, so that close to death. Cuz I must have been about 30 foot in the air. So it's cut a long story short, he gave me about four or five near experiences and he went. And the whole point of this, he went, so that's why I think I'm going to die of something horrible like cancer. And I went, why? He went, right, you ready for this? Yeah. He said, well, I don't check my balls. Wait. He said, I don't like the feel. Carl, Carl, always check your balls. Why don't you like the feel of your own balls? They just, I mean, you know that I don't like bodies anyway, Right? Do you know what I mean? It worries me a bit that you've got all that going on in your body, right? And your skin's keeping it all in place. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. We're going down a whole other avenue of discussion. Let's play a track, let's come back to it. With grace. We will suffer. Right, this is Carl, the producer of Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant on XFM 104.9. We're playing out some of the best bits. Hope you're enjoying it. Here's another one. His homework was to come up with those stupid lateral thinking problems. We might. We maybe should give an example of the. Oh, Romeo and Juliet, right? Romeo's asleep on the bed, Juliet's on the floor covered in water and broken glass. What happened? And you ask all these stupid questions and it's, Romeo's a cat and Juliet's a goldfish. What am I thinking? Yeah, yeah, go on in, Carl. Right, yeah. There's a bloke lying on the floor, right? He's cut his head, blood's coming out of his head and all his mates come Running up and they're all stood round him. Yeah. And they don't take their hats off to. As a mark of respect. That's outrageous. Why didn't they take their ass off? But it's probably as good as the bloke. Absolutely. A bloke's fallen with his. Yeah. He's lying on the floor. Yeah. He's dead. Yeah. His mates come running. Wasn't it. Was it important that his head was cut? I don't know. Would have been okay if he'd have been wearing a hat. He wouldn't be dead if he was wearing a hat. What's your answer? No, you meant to answer question. You don't just go watch your answer. You say, where's the sensor? You go, no. And I have to guess, it's obviously like sort of motor motorcycle stunt team or a parachute team. Why didn't they take their hats off? Because they're probably still on the motorbikes or summer or. Yeah, but if you mark. Mark a respect to someone, you could take your helmet off. Getting angry. What? They're parachutists. Why can't they take their helmets off? Because they're still coming down from the skull. But he's on the floor dead. Yeah. They can look down and see him on the floor. Are they on the floor, Carl? They're on the floor as well. They're walking, aren't they? Yeah, well, they sort of stood there looking at him. They stood there, they're stood on the floor looking. They're soldiers. Why? But why, if they might be in. A battle zone, they might have their helmets on and they've been shot in the head. No. Well, that does work. You see, this is my point. That one works. That one works. Unless you give us a piece of information where that doesn't work. What? What, what's the difference? Why? Why is yours different to he's been shot in the head in the trenches and they're looking at him and they keep their helmets on. I just don't think it matters as much. If they're in the trench, they're already guarded a little bit, so they could take their hats off. It's the best mate, for God's sake. Okay, he's dwelling on this. Are they normal hats? I'll go ahead and give you the answer. No, don't get ratty. What kind of hats are they based on? If I told you what sort of hats they are, you'd have the answer. Wow. Okay, I've got a guess what sort of a hat it is then. Have I Right. Is it a trilby? No. Is it a bomb? I know what it is. What? They're spacemen. No. Oh, that's a good one. That one works as well. This is my point. I like that one a lot. It works. He's fallen on the moon and there are not. The moon happened. It was set up. We know that. Yeah. Okay, Carl, what's your answer? Builders on a building site. Why is that different to soldiers? Because bricks don't fall in wars, but bullets fly. All right, let's play a record and we'll come back to it. Carl, while you think about what you've done. Oh, yeah, you've been embarrassed. Let's play some classic suede. Yeah. And this is for David and Kieran. I think you wanted a bit of a bit of Butler. Xfm 104.9. I'm actually Bayes with me, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Steve. Well, we were talking about the news just now and there was a story I heard in the Week, I think it was on the radio. And I don't know all the details, but what I heard was that a number of. I think it was Falkland, maybe Gulf War war veterans were, I think, suing or complaining to the government because they wanted compensation for post traumatic stress disorder. Now, I don't know all the ins and outs of it, but it seems to me that if you're in the army and you're a soldier, a certain degree of trauma is kind of inevitable. I mean, after all, if you're any good at your job, you are going to see people getting killed. So I don't understand what the ins and outs of it. I don't know why nobody came back and Tony Blair met him and go, all right. Well, not really. No. Go on, what's the matter? Well, if there was people shooting at us and everything. That was all muddy. Well, calm down, don't cry. Well, I will. There was a drill sergeant just kept shouting, saying, look at you, stupid boy. Where's this gun? I just cleaned the gun and it was fine. And now he's telling me to clean it again. Yeah, the boots, they were shiny. You can't do that. It's more. His neck was as big as his head. Well, yeah, but you don't know what they, you know, I don't know what. The ins and outs of it are, but is it. What you got to do is make sure you know what you're going into. That's what I do. You got to check the small print. So if I was, you know, Going over to, like, the fault runs or, you know, the gobs are. I'd put, man, I'll go, will. Will it be horrible? Will be horrible, yes, it will be horrible. There will be shooting and lots of death and everything. I go, right, I'm not gonna go. Okay, then that should be fine. Yeah, fine, yeah, just like that. Does anyone else scared about this? Pretty much all of us. Okay, then we won't send anyone. My brother went into the army, right, because he couldn't get a normal job. And my dad said, you know, if you don't get a job by such a day, that's it, son, you're going in the army. When was the Falklands, was it about 8? 81. Right, right. And he joined back in, like 81 or something. And it. I don't know, it was an older shot or something. Oh, yeah. And he wrote back to me mum saying, you know, a bad time to join. Bad time in this. So she wrote, what? Bad join. That's so sweet, Carl, isn't it? That's like, Dear Dad. Yeah, well done. Don't know if you've noticed. Yeah, I was on the doll, that. That's for sure. Thank you for joining. A month before the Belgrano. Anyway, go on. My mum called up, spoke to the sergeant and said, can you leave him out of this one? Can you leave him out of this one? What? The Falkland War. He's only just joined. And she called him Chuck, which he got done for, like, she. She's one of them. I think it's a northern thing, like saying, how are you, Chuck? Yeah, and she called the sergeant, Chuck. And he. The sergeant said to me, brother, your mom, you know, she's called up and asked if you can not go, which, of course, you know, I mean, we'll see how it goes. What do you mean? Why did Sergeant even entertain this? Well, Pilkington, come here. Your mum's been giving me a bit of earache. Now, listen, tell her I've told you, but can you call her? Because she was really. She called me Chuck and everything. Can you call her and say you don't mind? We're not. Oh, please, because I've promised her. I'll say you want to go. No, please say you want to go. Why was he entertained in this phone call? Because he was new to the army, I suppose. I don't know. Maybe they do that. So what happened? Did. He didn't go in the end, so he didn't go. Now he can't it. I love it, though, going over the Top. I've got a note. Yeah. Is this. Is this really your mum? Yeah. Okay, now this seems to be you. Because I noticed it says, I do not want to go into the army. I don't want to go and fight. And it's crossed out and it's good. My mum says, don't. Yeah. You didn't write this yourself. No, no, my mum wrote this. Okay, Definitely wrote this. Your excuse. You're gonna have to fill envelopes. No, I'm sure if he was needed, he would have had to go. But I think they made a bit of a special effort. They sort of said, oh, well, it wasn't conscription anyway. Oh, no. Where are the other soldiers? Going around. Just going. To. No, he ended up being a mechanic in there and he got kicked out for going for a packet of fags in a tank. What? Now wait a minute, wait a minute. Do you mean he nipped down the shops in a tank? Yeah. I don't believe that car. You've. Honest to God, that. And he went off with the sergeant's wife, so that didn't help and he ended up getting kicked out. Sorry. Your. Your brother's a genius. I love this. I love this. First of all, he gets a call from his mum going, let him up. He goes, oh, God. Then he goes, where is. Where's Pilkington? His mum's on the phone. He's. Where is he? He's near your house, Sergeant. Near my house? Well, why is. No reason. Well, when he comes back when he's finished, tell him his mum called and can you get me a packet of hags? Tell him to walk this time. So the sergeant phoned out that he was sleeping with his wife? Yeah. I don't know. I mean, did your mum phone up. And say, let him off. Time. Can he? Yeah, yeah. That's fantastic. But he misses it. I mean, I haven't seen him for about 11 years, but ever since he came out, he's just kept getting into trouble and that. In the army, you know, people slag it off, but I think if you're a certain type of person, it's. It's good for you. It didn't straight in me. He was going down the shops in the tank. He was shagging someone. It's really weird. It's like back then he was like a proper adult and he had a house and he collected crystal with his wife and that. And now he ain't got any of that. Has he got the wife? No. Has he got the crystal? Don't think he has. Seriously. I haven't seen him for about 11 or 12 years. Carl's stories always start off nice and funny and then they just leave me empty and slightly depressed. I don't know whether to hug him or shoot him. Put him out of his misery. Can we take Carl to the phone in? If you think I should take Carl to the vets and have him put down because it's just too stressful. This is what I'd like to leave you with. A song for the ladies. Darkness on the Edge of Town from the amazing album of the same night Name Springsteen. See you next week. Bye.",

And so he's about 30 and I moved it. And he brought around all his records when he was storage to leave him at our house, right? And he had all these old sort of records, 50s and 60s records, right? And. And they put him upstairs and I was looking through them and it's just all like Elvis stuff and Beetle stuff. And there was a mate of mine who loved Elvis, okay? And he. Loads of chemicals. Yeah, he had loads of chemicals and I was into chemistry and he said I swapped me some chemicals for them. So I sort of nicked about five Elvis singles and I got all these chemicals and. And then the guilt just hit me. I just thought, well, he's gonna notice that. And I just. One night I just came downstairs and I confessed to my mum and she went, all right, well, I won't tell him, but you've got to be good. And it's sort of like I was just really, really good for a year.
