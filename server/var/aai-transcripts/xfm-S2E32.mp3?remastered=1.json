It's only four minutes past. You have a placebo and you've got us three. So you're definitely going home with that. Yeah, whatever. That's safe. That's. That's on its way to the hospice. Exactly. You've banked that. Yeah. Now, do you want to gamble all that to go on and listen for another two hours? Well, you could walk away now and you're up. Yeah, you're up. You're already up. Right. That's brilliant. You have not wasted any time. Do you want to gamble that against another two hours? It might be shoddy, it might go downhill, but it might get even better. Kyle, what do you say they do listen for another two hours. Yeah. See, we shouldn't have done that. We shouldn't have asked Kyle, because a lot of them now are already taking what they've got. And what they've got is great. Rick. What they've got is lovely. They're loving that. They're going to enjoy that. We have got Monkey News. We've got Cheap as Chimps. That's not the same thing. How many rating stages have got two April Simian Features, Rick. And I point out a lot of people are making that mistake. A lot of people are thinking that Monkey News is exactly the same as cheapest chimps. It's not. Let's keep that clear. It's not. It's in the same ballpark, but it's. It's not. It's not the same. They're involved. They're involved. Yeah, yeah. We've also got some great music. Yeah. We've got an amusing sketch about a fly. And Mystique is dropping in. Let's hope the Mystique ladies are coming in. I want to kick off with a song that is. You know, you've got like half a dozen posing songs that, when you're sort of like between 14 and 18, they were the ones you'd put on to get ready to go out or just pose around or. Or be that pop star or think you're on stage or whatever, or in the video. And embarrassingly, I remember I dug this out and I remembered I used to post this like a mother when I was about 14. Right. This is Street Life by Roxy Music. Used to do. Mine was. Mine was Oops upside your head. Yeah, it was Just me on the floor in my bedroom. One day I thought, one day there'll be other people in this imaginary boat. Yeah, yeah. Elbows going everywhere, knocking over vases. A later, it was black lacy Superman, which is something similar. Do you remember that? That was brilliant. Spray ski. If you out there in radio land got any funny, funny jokes, then call. In, email them in because we need to. Street Life Roxy Music off the Stranded album. That's why I used to jump around. What would you have been wearing while you were listening to that? Well, probably Brutus gold jeans. Classy or green flash pumps. Sure. Any socks? I would have had socks. Yeah. I'd have probably been wearing the shirt my mum got me from Tesco's, which was. Which was again a Brutus shirt. And it had women in bikinis eating bananas on a chaise longue. Of course it did. Lots of small, small ones or just one. Lots of little small ones. Yeah. So, you know, so that was that. I remember when I was. When I met on holiday about that time and I was about 14, but my older brother had this leather jacket and I was on the. I was on the beach just, you know, in, in the shorts and that, and I went to get an ice cream or something. I said, can I borrow a jacket? And I put his jacket on and I was frozen on the beach thinking, they are all looking at me because I look so good and I also a straw Stetson. And I really thought, yeah, I'm turning into quite a man. Yes, I'm quite a catch. Yeah, yeah. Just thinking. They're just thinking they're going there looking and going, who's that dude? Is he American? Is it? Hold on, is he. Has he just come from. Wait a minute, I'm in a bikini and I like bananas. I could be the woman for him. Oh, dear. What was that? Didn't you have a T shirt or jacket or something you wore to university that was pretty classy. Didn't have like some. Some foul language on it or something. What was it? Yeah, I had when I was. This was 18. Right. The Christmas or the birthday before I went to university. Got two sweatshirts, one black, one red had on them and the red one. All my clothes, the first wash, everything was pink. All my white shirts and my white socks, of course, because I just put it and I didn't know. Yeah, yeah. So. So that I was a man at university with all pink clothes except for a rather nice red sweatshirt with on it. O. So again, turning into quite a man. Was that. Was that pre or post? The Time you washed your clothes by getting in the bath and that was pre. That was the second year when I was in to go and digs out Hall's residence. So I had a bath and you had to sort of like pay for a bath, you know, so I thought two birds of one stone. I got in the bath with all my white shirts because I was going through sort of, you know, wearing a white shirt and tie that sort of David Sylvian sort of fine for everything and Daz and I just wriggled around in it. I washed myself. It's quite a good exfoliant. So yeah, I didn't do it again because it was sort of not good for the skin. Quite sore. Is it around? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So there you go, Roxy Music and Street life. Carl, thoughts? I just was. Just. Was working out time really just. We've got. Well, last week we had a lot of stuff that we didn't manage to cramming, which was good. So I'm just looking at. We've got. We have got Cheapest Chimps coming. Songs of Phrase. Oh, we haven't some stuff. Why don't we kick off with that so we don't forget it Cheapest Cheers or Songs of Phrase or the film thing. We did get the film done. Yes. We've also got a new feature, Cheeky Freak of the Week. Incidentally, I should just put down there that someone has Ashley Phillips has emailed in and. Because obviously with Songs of Phrase what Carl does, for those who have not heard it, he takes a phrase that you might hear commonly on the show and then he uses. There's this. Every Chinese kid. You've never seen an old bloke eating a. And yeah, as I say, he uses different chunks of songs and he makes up that phrase and so he has made some suggestions here, Carl. Because he thinks that the more common. Carl, you're an idiot, fool, etc perhaps a little overheard. He'd like to maybe hear Carl Paul's. I don't know where to start. Which is a common one from Ricky. Carl, which bit of that do you actually think is true? And then there's the regular dialogue between the three of us. Carl. Well, you know, it could happen. Me. Sure, sure, Ricky. No, no, no, Carl, it could never happen. Not now, not ever. You're an idiot. Player record. So maybe some of those you could use. Well, we get it going then today. Yeah, this week we're. Do you remember the story about my auntie having win for five minutes? Was it your Auntie Nora? Auntie Nora. She was On a lot of medication and stuff, and I think that's a side effect that comes with it. So, yeah, she had wind for. So I thought we'd dig that one out. Classic line. Me auntie had wind for five minutes. Okay, so I've got loads of songs here. How many is that? Me Anti Ad Wind. Four, five minutes, seven tracks. That's tricky. Okay, so you need to identify, if you can be bothered, the artists. That's what we're after, isn't it? All right. Okay. Just remember as many as you can get, because the winner would probably be, you know, it gets five or something. So don't worry if you. There's a couple you can't get because you could still probably win. Can I just. What's the email address? It's. Well, if they go to xfm.co.uk Ricky, they can just send them through there and that. Send them through that way. Which of these is the. The prize bag? Yeah, don't we get them mixed? That's the one, is it, Carl? All right, so let's see what hot treats you could win as I get them out. Carl, do you want to play it once more? I recognize all them except one. Right, let me see what we've got here. Once again, Carl, you excelled yourself with an arbitrary collection of DVDs. Just hanging around. Were they just hanging around again? I'm always interested to know which of our XFM listeners has tastes as broad as this. Go on. We've got the recent BBC adaptation of the Hound of the Baskerville. Brilliant. Okay, fair enough. We've got. What's this? Is this the. This is something involving air? The band air. I think it's a single at best. Yeah, this is probably worth having. This is the current Flaming Lips album, so you've excelled yourself there. Actually, Carl, that's not bad. An XFM mouse map. They're as common as muck. You can't give away that mouse mat. It's a piece of foam. Now, I was going to dismiss the. The oddball sci fi movie K Pax, featuring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges, but Carl, signed by Kevin. Yeah, it's an actual so that. So win that and put on eBay for £4 50. And man alive, what is that? Just look at their faces. No, Carl, don't give that. No one wants that unless it's ironic. Series one and two on DVD of popular Northern basic sitcom Bread. Buy it, sell it. The game's getting hard because someone's dealing you a losing card. They all had a go. All the actors had a line on that song. Oh, play the clips again. Play the clips again. I really want to win it now. Here we go. I can't believe this hasn't been done before. It's extraordinary because most of our ideas have. Verve. Lucky man. On XFM, 104.9, Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. The emails, I should point out, aren't flooding in. Nobody always takes time when they go through the website, does it? Yeah. So they'll be arriving in a bit. Do you want to play it once more for those that just joined us? All right, then. My auntie had wind for five minutes. Brilliant. Genius. Namely artists. Rick. I sometimes. I sometimes get off at the tube at Tottenham Court Road. If I. If I want to look at the record shops before I come into XFM and I. I always cut through Chinatown. Oh, yeah. And every time I come to Chinatown, the same thought always strikes me. I always feel like I want to just gather all the little locals, all the little Chinese fellows, just gather them round and just go, guys, in what way is this a town? It's not, is it? This is not. At best, what you've got here is a novelty street. Yeah. Gerard street is not a town name. No, it's not a town. You've had this standing. Yeah, yeah. You can't just call it Chinatown and claim it's a town. If I was them, though, and you. I go, I go, what is a town? It is a town. It is a town. It's our town. We've got all. Lots of stuff. Where's your church? Where's your mayor? We needed. We got a. Got a betting shop. Not enough. It is. See, all you've got here is restaurants. No, that's. That doesn't. No, no, no, no, no. Got a little supermarket with snacks. What does it sell? Snacks specifically, I would imagine crackers. Yeah, yeah. Do you want to buy a dragon? Do you want to buy an ornamental dragon? If I. If I wanted to buy one, this is where I. Do you want to buy. Do you want to buy a gold dragon? Is it made of gold? No, it's made of plastic, but it's sprayed gold. Do you want to buy that? It's not a town. It is a town. Yeah. And it annoys me because when I first came to London, I genuinely thought Chinatown was going to be this amazing. Like, you know, like what they've got there is. You'd hear a gong and. Yeah, every time we went in there. And there'd be Rick Shaws and people Walking on those little sort of wooden shoes. You know those ones. They're brilliant. They are. Just clomping around in them, but nothing. It's nothing, just. Yeah, exactly. It just reminds me of. Have you ever been to any of those sort of museums? You tend to have them up north where they've got. Like, you've got. You sort of sit in a little car and it sort of rides you through kind of. I don't know, it might be Newcastle. Victorian era. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Grab a half a pound of those sweets, please. Of course you can. If there were some animatronic men, it would just be an exhibit. Yeah. Although their concession had been 100 years ago, is that there's some scales in the shop and there's a horse outside. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Yeah. The traditional sounds and smells of old England and. And the voice were going. Of course there was no television. Amazing. Yeah, amazing. Brilliant. Yeah. Welcome to Chinatown. So it's not. Yeah, it's a good point. Is that a piece of traditional music? Yeah. Is that some traditional Chinese music? Or is that music that someone in this country wrote, thinking it sounded like chines? I think it was the. Was it the Vapors, wasn't it? Oh, is that. What is that? No, no, no, no. That's the music. Are you sure they didn't take that from. It's that. It's that pentatonic scale, isn't it? What is it called? It's the black notes on the piano. Right. That's the one I can play along with. Eastenders. Yeah. Do you know what I don't get with it? Go on. Chinatown. Yeah, Chinatown. Because I always walk through it on the way to work. Couple of things annoy me. First of all, I think it's bad business, just because if you've got. If you've got a Chinese restaurant, put it somewhere where there isn't any others. It's a good point. Yeah. But it's also a community. They're not just a theme park for other people. I ended up. I remember going out one night with Suzanne, some friends, and you got there and there's so much choice. It's that dilemma of. Oh, forget it. Well, not really. It's specifically fancy Chinese. Well, no, but why don't you go to the one with the dead ducks hanging in the window? That's my favourite thing as well. It's like. Normally you put your good stuff in the window, if that's what's in the window. Yeah, yeah. And the other thing that annoys me, walking through it. Today there's always lard on the floor. It is. Honestly, I'm scared I'm gonna slip over. It's because all the restaurants and that. But why is it. That's another point. Well, it's not. It's not oozing out of the restaurants. But why is it? Why is it. I don't know what they do. Just careful, listen. No, but why is it. That's why they used to wear those little wooden shoes. Okay, that's. We've got. The thing is, as well, they try and wash it with water, which doesn't work with lard and it's like oil, famously. Yeah. You know what I mean? Even I know that. Yeah. You've got to scrub it. So you think sorted that out. Yeah. You think they'd know, wouldn't you? Yeah. All right. Anyway, thanks for your thoughts on China, Carl. Right, I'm gonna play this thing again because it is a bit slow today. The email. Oh, because it's too hard. It's not too hard. There's just clips of tongs. What are the artists email in xfm.co.uk. He'S getting annoyed because he put the work in. And that one's good. He's getting annoyed. Oh, remember, I think Kevin Spacey and the signed K Pax DVD is probably the only incentive to try and have a go at that one. Don't just think you could win by getting one of them. Exactly. They're coming in now. Okay. This is electronic. Electronic Getting away with it, definitely. Do you reckon we'll get away with it? You see, you've worried me now. Yeah, I don't know. He's worried me. My apologies if you're offended at all by my reference to those little wooden shoes. That's not gonna help. Rick used to wear. Don't they still wear them? We've only had one complaint, haven't we? That we got from the sonies. That one about talking about the swan's penis. But yeah, you know, things about complaints is that people complain all the time. It's whether it's upheld because it goes from authority and then they have to go, oh, yeah, look, that was. That was in poor taste or pre warshed or some of the things you. Said on tv, though you must have been stung. Well, obviously I've only had. Again, I've only had one upheld. One serious la. The wrist for something I said. But what was he saying? Can you repeat it? Well, I can, yeah. I was talking about. And it was a true story. I was talking about this little old man who is his daughter was taking him to home because he used to fry up bacon and rub it around his. To get the dog to lick them. Right. And you got a complaint. Yeah. And that was it. That's. That's why you got a complaint? Yeah, yeah. What's up with that? Well, he said it on Songs of Praise. They said it was in poor taste, I suppose. What other complaints? You know, the most. You know the biggest complaint ever on tv, the most complaints ever for anything on TV was the showing of the Last Temptation of Christ. Yeah. Do you know the second? Yeah. The second was, I think Ann Robinson put in the Welsh into room 101. What, because she didn't like him and that. Yeah. She just said, well, you know, they're going in, you know. She said it slightly more eloquently than that. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I can understand. The people or the place? I don't know. I think it was the place and therefore the people. Yeah. What do you mean? Yeah, no, you know, me mum and dad have sort of moved from Manchester. They've retired now in Wales. Oh. Yeah. And it is. Look at his face, turning his nose up. No, but it is pretty depressing, do you know what I mean? It's just one of them places that it's like you go back in time and that when you go there. I mean, maybe the major city's there, maybe Cardiff is. All right. Well, even coming from Manchester, it's like going back in time, it's just. It's like one of them places. It feels like every day is Sunday. Do you know what I mean? It's just depressing and gray and slightly. Walking around going, I'm late. Well, yeah. Here's the sort of attitude they have, right? This. And this is true, because my mom, dad live there and that, Right. And they love it. It's all right. It's an healthy place to go when you get older and that. But this, this is why they don't move on in Wales. Well, I'd just like to make another sorry to any Welsh people listening. We're not saying you don't move on. Carl is. No. But sorry about the little Chinese shoes. The thing is, it's good that in a way that they do do that and they don't want to be like, you know, rushing about everywhere because the way London is, isn't that great either, is it? Because it's totally opposite. Yeah. Right. So I'm not. I'm not having a go. It is a bit dull. I think even people who live there will agree with me. Okay, right. But like one of the shops that my mum, dad use, right, it's only a little sort of villagey type shop. Can't be bothered staying open for hours and hours. Right. Because there's not enough people use the shop. Yeah. So what you do is they get used to what you buy. They leave it out. They put it in a phone box outside. They put it in a phone box. Yeah, so it doesn't get wet. So my dad's loving that. Once he found that out, it was like, brilliant. But that. How is that a bad thing? That's brilliant. Well, it's not for other people. It is for me dad, because he's picking up all sorts of stuff. Oh, no, he's not. Oh, yeah. He's not nicking other people shopping. Well, it's not like nicking, is it? Cause it's not theirs yet. Oh, and you've stitched him up on radio. Well, of course, because they're gonna think, who's that? Who is there in town with a mank accent. Who keeps making phone calls? And it's getting fatter. Yeah, Faster. I love that. I love that. That. Your dad was excited when he found out. I can't believe. I can't believe that he's moved there. He's retired to this little village where it's based on trust and community and he's abusing it. He's using his scally mank ways. Bloody helic bled again. There's old women hungry. The cats aren't getting fed and your father is just. I can't. That's obscene. That's obscene. Oh, I think it's a die thief. That fella from Manchester. I don't even think they've got sky there yet, have they? They can't listen. They won't. They won't know what's. I think you stitched him right up. I hope you have, actually. I hope he goes down for it. It. I hope he's handed out of the community like Frankenstein's monster. Yeah. They should get burning torches, go up to the set fire. He set fire to his cottage. Yeah, exactly. Right, well, he's out of the choir. Yeah. Streets. Yeah, Material. You're listening to the streets down your aal Streets. Has it come to this? Could I just extend, Rick, my apologies now to both the Chinese community and Welsh people listening? Yeah, and I'm sure that list will increase as the show goes on. Forget about tomorrow. Feeder. Right, listener, I'm talking to you now. Have you seen these posters? Around with me and Steve on it. Right. It's embarrassing. Right. We were mucking around at a photo session and XFM want to do some post. We couldn't be bothered to do them again, so we let him have this one. Irony comes back to haunt you and it looks. Look like. I think I'm Simon Templar or Summer. And Steve's all right, but we think that Carl should be in it. Definitely Carl doesn't want to be in it, but it looks like everyone listens to this show for. For Carl's basically, you know, innocent stupidity and some great tracks. They don't listen for us anymore, Steve. So I think it should be a campaign to get Carl on the poster. Yeah. Well, I should point out that I think XFM are more than happy to have him on the poster. So it's just him. You don't want to be on there, do you? There's no. There's no need for me to be on it. Of course there is. Why not? I've got so many emails here as I'm sat during the show reading them. So many emails saying, what does Carl look like? If you go to xfm.co.uk Ricky, we've got those film bits on there, those video mock ups where I'm part of it. You can sort of. That's not enough, Carl. People want to see your face. You're part of the show. You're an intrinsic part of the show. Yeah, we'll get. We'll get you on the poster. Why? It'll be too much on a poster. They can only take in so much. What do you mean they can only take so much? Yeah, it's good with two people. No, it's enough. So what are. What do groups do, then? Well, they haven't. It's like. It's like Ringo Starr is being left off the COVID of Sergeant Pepper. Yeah. Or. Or Rutherford doesn't get in a look in with Genesis. Exactly. Which would be outrageous. Yeah. I'll say. Oh. Oh, sorry, Tony Banks, you can't be in this one. Yeah. It's just me and you will be very. You see, you look like the Colin. So you've got me in there. Yeah. I don't photograph that well either. You're joking. Is it because the shiny look a little cue ball? Because it just shines off the top. A lot of people as well. You should dispel the myth. A lot of people think for some reason that you're fat. A lot people say to me, is he fat? No. But that's because they haven't got much hair so it looks like my head's big. No, they haven't even seen you. They just think from listening to the show that you're fat. That's because you're northern. They think you just eat chips and complain about the weather. Well, complain about the south. I just think you could answer a lot of your critics. But then you see what I don't like about this world. A lot of people judge people on the way they look. Yeah. Oh, like you do. If only more people thought like that, Steve. But Carl, you judge people on the way they look. Yeah, yeah, I know, that's what I mean. But I couldn't with me, could I? Because I don't know what I look like. What if I was listening to me on the radio, I wouldn't be able to say, oh, he's a, you know, and slag me off and that. Because I don't know what I look like and I quite like that. Do you know what I mean? I lost. I don't know. It just believe me, right, I'm right on this one. It's best if you leave it. Well, we're not going to leave it. We're going to get you on the poster. Yeah. I mainly have to see myself on videotape this morning. You know the animal show? I did the show, I'm doing a video and I did behind the scenes footage and I've got a. You've seen it, haven't you? I feel a bit of Carl on those. It's great, it's lovely. He can't believe it. He said, is it playing slow? Because he's so slow. I come into the office going, alright, that's how you head as well. I look like I'm looking into a spoon. I'm not happy with it. I just think that if we're willing to. If Ricky's willing to use his celebrity profile for the sake of the show, I'm willing to look like, let's say a fairly handsome kind of cool customer. I think at least, the very least, Carly, is that you appear on there as well. You could dress up. Are you worried that you'll look the worst out of all three of us? Who am I standing next to? Am I next to Steve? I'm fairly confident. Yeah. I like the way it's so predictable. You pull the string because you know what it is. You pull the string. What are we talking about before complaint? Oh, I wasn't telling. Yeah. You know the, the most complaints ever. The Last Temptation of Christmas. I haven't seen it. Was it Scorsese in it? Smart Scorsese. And I. I've bought the film actually, recently because I was intrigued to see it, but I've not actually watched it. But from what I understand, the reason that it was so outrageous is because it has a whole sequence which shows what it would be like if Jesus had lived his life and not martyred himself on the cross, but lived his life as a human being, part of which is him having sex. And so I think that was chiefly what the outrage was, that it was showing this. This godly man to be, you know, as human as. As he was supposedly, you know, because he's supposed to be human as well. So. So that's the reason. That was the reason that there was complaints there. I don't know. I haven't seen the film. You see him, do you. You see him having sex? I think. Yes. Although it is an actor, Carl. Yeah. Jesus Christ. It's not the real. It's not the real Robert Powell. It's an actor playing Robert Powell. You see, sex on films and all that, right. When I was growing up, I'd be watching. No, just saying. An example of this, really. When I was growing up as a kid and I'd be watching films with my dad, he'd really be enjoying a film. And then a sex scene would happen, right? And he'd go on film, or just behind you in the film, a sex scene would happen. Your brother up to his old tricks. Again, and he'd get up and go make a cup of tea. Right? Right. Typhoon. That he'd stolen from some sort of telephone box. And like, even recently, he thinks it ruins a film. Do you know what I mean? Because there's no need for it to happen, is there, really? Yes. Why, sometimes it's. It. What? It's warranted if the film itself is. Yeah. There's some films it isn't, though. Some films it isn't. Some films. It's hard, I think. I think the films that him and his dad watch together on Channel 5. Probably not. Is it only on Channel 5 in your house? Yeah, if you're watching, you know, I don't know, a late night, Friday night, you know, from 1983. Yeah. Illegal briefs. A beautiful lawyer has to defend a man who may be a killer. She falls in love with him, but does she. Does she know a real man? Oh, you know what I mean, though. Lest you forget, of course, that I. Love Heat with the bloke that is now in. Go On. You know, of course, I. According to The Internet Movie database. I once appeared in one of those films in the film Killer Image, a Canadian film, I believe, from 1989, according to that computer. It's all right. It's all wrong. It's all wrong. Of course it is. Yeah. Apparently I was in that. And I played the role of Kirk. Was it a porn thing? No, no, I think it's just an erotic thriller. All right. I suppose you only had a very small part, though, didn't you? Indeed, yeah. Yeah. But no. Do you know what I mean? Sometimes you don't need to go that far. Say, like in this Jesus program, right? Film. What's it called? The Last Temptation. You know what, what's his name? Is it Ralph in the Simpsons? Yes, I draw the kitty cat. It's like talking to that. Yeah, no, but right. This temptation thing. Right. Do you know. You know, often we don't get that many complaints on this show. We don't get very many complaints. And I think that's either because there's no listeners or B, it's because most people agree with Carl and that turns out to me. Or they let him off because it's like, you know, you can plead insanity, you can go mental and kill a few people where they go, oh, he's. He's a bit backwards. Was it because, like, they're saying that he was having it away, or is it because you saw it what got the complaints? The complaint was the very suggestion. Suggestion? It was a blasphemous thing. Not the fact that you saw an act. Actor's knob. So what about if they just cut it down a bit and you, like, saw the little stable door closing? It wasn't the baby Jesus having sex, it was the grown man. The stable door shutting. No, but do you know the nativity sheet? Ah, that is brilliant. The wise men saying, I can't believe we brought mirror. We should have brought condoms. Yeah, yeah. It's two for one. Offering boots. Yes. I don't know what we were thinking. With my consent. It's just that it's always awful. Should we apologize now to the Christian church as well? So we did. Little Chinese fellas, little Welsh fellas and the little Christian fellas. We haven't said anything wrong. No, no. It's like, you see, when I. When I was growing up, I love the idea that in Carl's world he was born in a stable. Just thought, well, I love this place. Yeah. I'm just gonna stay here the rest of my day. This is good here. Oh, brilliant. Well, when I was watching television, Mum, Dad, I mean it still happens now, right? My dad will sort of go off, ruined, good film ruined, right? If some sex scene happens. But what are we talking about? Sex scene. Are we talking about kissing or are we talking about penetration? Then looking at the camera going, are you enjoying this, Pilkingtons? What are we talking about? What is sort of extreme levels? We're talking about last time I was down there, right? Yeah. What was it? Me. Joe, Meet Joe Black. Meet Joe Black. Meet Joe Black is a terrible film. Film. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There was. It's good film. And then you know it's gonna happen because like the music comes in, Brad Pitt's keeping quiet, a woman's eyeing him up, sure. So I love that. My mom's. My mum's worked it out already and she's going, anything on the other side, love? She knows, she knows, she knows it's, you know, something's. So you can be enjoying a film and you can be an hour and 10 in and then some spidey senses of one of them can go, should we turn it over? And the other one goes, yeah, right. Are you sure it's not them protecting you from scenes of sex? So what they're thinking is, what if Carl gets the idea to have sex, yeah, that could lead to procreation. We don't want any more like him. We've got to, we've got to end the line here. You sure it's not the doctor keep calling it going. You are keeping away from women, aren't you? He must never find out. Are you sure they're not embarrassed because they're watching a sex scene with their son? It happens every time, right? There's two things that my mum does for a right. It's that if there's sex scene on the telly, she'll go, you know, anything on the other side, love? And the other thing, she always says, if ever there's anything on the telly with Elvis in it, yeah. She goes, oh, I like him. Right? And we all know, we sat there, we know what she's gonna say next. Yeah. So you don't even bother saying why, right? And she goes, he likes fat ugly people. He what? He liked fat ugly people. He didn't always go for like the good looking fans in the crowd, what Elvis did. Yeah, right. That was always the thing. I'm sorry. Now hold on, I. I don't know what we' now with our lives, Steve, wait a minute. Right, so your mum says two things, right? She either says, is there anything else. On this Or I like Elvis. There's a pause because you know what she's gonna say next. She says, he liked fat ugly people. How often does this occur? Well, because they've got like, you know, sky. There's a lot of those channels on. They like the music channels. So Elvis always comes on. There's either an Elvis film, there's like, you know, a classic hit by him on. And she go, I like Elvis. He likes fat ugly people. And what do you liked? Fat ugly people. Because there's that special Vegas show, isn't he, where he's dancing about, right? And he's got loads of scarfs around his neck. Towels. Yeah. And like he always hands them down to the fat ugly ones. And I always say it's because they're the fat. You know, we got a sweaty face because they. They can't. You know what I mean? I don't know what world they live in. What sort of world are you going when you watch. And what do you mean fat ugly ones? You mean they're in the front, they're sweating a lot because they're a bit chubby. She thinks, you know, is giving them. A towel because he's really going, wipe your face. You're putting me off, you fat cow. Stop sweating near me. There's another one. What? So airy Chinese kids. Yeah. Jesus. We haven't slagged off airy Chinese kids. We. We slagged off Chinese. We didn't slag anyone off. We just said, they really haven't got a town, as such. And they wear shoes. What do we say? Little wooden shoes. And what did the weather. I just don't know how we got onto Elvis and big fat ugly women. I don't know where we. I don't know how we see you from the Last Temptation across. Did you see that? Fat girls and feeders. Hey, what's on? Patty first. Oh, brilliant. It's a great song. Break down. How many other radio shows have talked about Last Temptation of Christ? China to home. Yeah. Ugly women. 60 Minutes. Exactly. Incredible. Sony Award winning. CHEERING breaks Painkiller on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. I should point out now, Rick, that the general consensus from the. The listeners is that Carl should definitely be on the post. I know that. I know there's an interesting email. Of course they should. I love to see Carl on the. On the poster, especially as I'm watching him on the webcam today and wearing that shirt. Doesn't he look like Charlie Brown. He looks just like Charlie Rain from the Peanuts cartoons. Oh, my God. That's it. From now on, if anyone ever asks me what he does look like. Charlie Brown. Oh, it's great because Charlie Brown has got that thing. You've got less features than morph. It's just a round head and there's human aspects. It's just the bare minimum. When I draw a cartoon of him, it's so easy. Yeah. Ah. The thing is, right, if I go on the poster, this is what I'm worried about. Where do you go from there? What do you mean? Well, it's difficult in it. Do you know, like, before, you were talking about the complaint that a TV channel got about some fella putting bacon. Yeah, yeah, that was me. Yeah, yeah. You were talking about. I did put the bacon on me. Yeah. I was talking about it here. And they got a complaint. Yeah. Right. Now he had to do that to get a kick. Yeah, yeah. Where do you go from there? And it's the same for me on a poster. Once they've seen me. Yeah. And we get sued by the estate of Charles M. Schultz for using without copyright, his most popular creation. It's just that if people don't know, it keeps them interested. They don't need to. They're not tuning in every week on the off chance that we'll. They're wondering what you look like. Like. Yeah. But the ones who are, it just keeps them. They won't let them down there when they see your picture. It won't let them down. It won't be a letdown. It's exactly as it should be anyway. Competition. Yeah. Right. Let's get the answers. Let's get this out of the way. Songs of phrase. Songs of phrase. Just in case you just tuned in. It's a new feature we've been doing. We take songs and chop them up and that. And it's a. It's a phrase that has cropped up on the show a few times this week. We were going back to the classic Me Auntie had win for five minutes. Okay. Right. So what you have there is you had the knack. Yeah. With my Mama Mai Sharona, Auntie was some Manson track. What? You don't even. You don't even know what it was, Auntie. Everything. I think it's called some album track. Right. Then you add Bill Medley, Jennifer Warnes, I have had the time of My Life. You had Bob Dylan, Wind Blowing in the Wind. How blowing the wind was it? What was after that? 4. 4 was 2, 4, 6, 8. Motorway 2468. Motorway. Tom Robinson. Tom Robinson, yeah, that was the 4. Then you had the 5 from Manfred, man. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. We've wrapped it up with a bit of five star for a minute. Something about. Can't wait. Yeah, I can't wait another minute. Wait another minute. So they're the answers? Yeah, we're looking for someone who. I don't think we got anyone who. Had them all right, but nobody got all seven. Although in your little answer list then you only listed six because you got your numbers went out of sync in your own brain. Well done. Once again, smooth. I tell you what, Carl, why don't you next week at least write down the answers for yourself? Don't need to. Well, you clearly do because you just devour yourself. Don't need to. You've proved that you do. Well done. I'm going to give it to Paul Tear PJ Tier because he got five of the seven. Well done. So he gets. And he's getting that signed Kevin Spacey. Yeah, if you can just email us your address as well and get them off to you today. All right, Brilliant. That's what you're dealing with. So you've done that, you've done that competition that's been put to bed. Let's have a great tune, Rick. And then what else we got? We got some monkey news. We've got some monkey news. We've got Cheap as Chimps. We're doing the film thing. Right, what film is it this week? Silence of the Lambs. You can be owning that by 3 o'clock on VHS. Is it about 4.99 from here? Is it there abouts. 20Th century boy? Come on, Mark. Some people want a 21st century boy these days. Mark Bowen there a little bit out of date on XFM 104.9. Look at today, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Right, it's that time again, is it Monkey news? Yeah, monkey news. Sure, monkey. Monkey news. Right, if you're a new listener, this is where we do a bit of monkey news. Oh, imagine him giving these chance on a news program like News Night Review or news at 10. Over to Carl Pilkington. Yeah, all right. Monkey's gone mad again. Go on. Right, we've. We've done quite a lot of good stuff. The one that sort of kicks off up most of the fuss was probably Ollie the monkey. I love the fact that they're all monkeys. He's a chimpanzee. Well today, right, we're looking at one that's. It's Called Coco. Oh, yeah, the one, the sign language one. Well, what I've read about him is he speaks right. Highly educated photographer. I love the fact that when he gets a, you know, a gifted ape, he has to look up to him. He realizes that he is superior. I love that. Oh, and it also likes going on computer chat rooms. I can't take this anymore, Steve. I'm going to be sick. Oh, God. Right. That's pretty amazing. You know, if an infinite number of monkeys are in an infinite number of chat rooms, they'll eventually type. Which is your favorite episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Exactly. Yeah. You're an idiot. But the thing is, right, you're saying about the. The infinite thing again, about monkeys, if you put them in a room with a typewriter, they'll come up with Shakespeare. Yeah, I'd sort of agree with that. Right. With monkeys who can't do other stuff. But this one, I reckon is gonna be busy taking pictures and stuff. Yeah, I think monkeys that aboard. Boring. Is there a boring monkey? Is there? Would you ever have a chimp? And you'd go, Suzanne would go, I've got your birthday present. It's a chimp. It's a chimp fella. He's about, you know, about a sort of like a middle aged chimp. No, I'd love it. I'm talking. Would you ever go, I'll tell you what, Suzanne, that one's boring. No, no, but I bet the monkey would get bored. I mean, do you know what I mean? The monkey would be bored. I'd be loving it. I'd love to have a little monkey. Right, but what I'm saying is you. Really would, wouldn't you? You buy him a camera, he'd be happy again, wouldn't you? Well, yeah, but that's just it. You wouldn't get in touch. It's like if you can do other stuff, you don't want to do the boring stuff. Forget the typing, forget the monkeys. Typing. Talk about this monkey that's a photographer. Well, we are in a way. I'm just saying that that would be happier. Monkeys that have got nothing else to do, if they can't take pictures and that and they can't go on chat. Rooms, they're happy to sit in a room typing away from Trinity. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? He's got maybe a little exhibition to put on. Do you think, do you know most. Do you know that most chimps and apes and monkeys still actually just live in trees? These are in laboratories and zoos and things. You know that that's not the norm. These, these monkeys. Yeah. Walking around sort of chatting and riding bikes. Yeah. You know that's not natural. Exactly. No, I know, but if you left. A bike in the jungle and then came back a few years, like there wouldn't be monkeys riding around on it. And a book. If you left a bike with a book in the basket, right, and you went away for 10 years and you came back, there wouldn't be a whole new transport system and schools. No, they'd eat it. They throw it around and eat it. All right then. So what you're saying is you can't see what I think is, is right. And don't take this the wrong way in that. Right. Stephen Hawking. Yes. Right. Now he had a bad illness. Now I wonder if he'd be. I wonder if he'd be as bright as he is if he didn't have that. Right. Because he's had time to sit down, he's like, well, what can I do? Yeah, go and give him a book. And he read it. I like that. Give us another one. Yes. He's got a lot of time on his hands. Yes. Now what I'm saying is monkeys, right, they, that, this one here, Coco, which I think was a gorilla. Right, right. That wouldn't have been happy on a little keyboard just doing that all day because it'd be going, well, I could be out taking pictures. Sure. Play a record. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? Play a record. Yeah, done. You're an idiot. There it was. There's the catchphrase. Once more. It is, is an idiot. It. Sure, sure. Athlete el Salvador on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, the, the, the amazing Steve Merchant and the. And the incredible Carl Pilkington. All right, right, we've done that. Monkey news. Right, Straight. Let's, let's, let's hit them dead. Let's go straight with cheap as chimps out. Right, well this, this, this will probably finish today, to be honest. Right. Cuz what if we looked at it? Cheapest Chimps. We found out that One banana next. Go on, do this. One banana a day. Yeah, that's it. Brilliant. So what? It was a long running feature. Go on. Sorry, can I just ask again? What are the rules with cheapest gyms? It's just, you know, if you wanted a chimp, how much would it sort of cost you? Brilliant title. Confessed. So, so, yeah, yeah, as always, that's the way they do it. All right. Cheapest Chimps. I Thought I'll go online and see, you know, if I could buy one. How much do you reckon? £6,000 to buy a chimp? Yeah, I know, ridiculous amount. Where can you buy them? From what sources? You shouldn't be able to buy them. EBay. What do you mean buy a chimp from whom? There was this website that was selling stuff. What? You could actually. What are you talking. What are you talking about? Right, here we go then. Right, I looked at it, here's some of the other animals that were on there. No, no, wait a minute. What are these? Poachers? I don't know what the zoos that. Got bored with them. Where can you buy a chimp? I don't want to give it a plug. Right, so what are the other animals available? Right, well that'll give you some prices with the other animals and you can try and work out if it's cheap as chimps. Right so, right, a camel, what do you reckon? £25,000. $8,000 for a camel. Right. Sloth, 40 quid. $3,000. All right, last one. Bengal tiger. Oh, that's gotta be pricey. $12,000. $1,800. What? Yeah. Carl, this is an awful website. That can't be true, mate. That's awful. A chimp, $5,000. I'm gonna go with $1,000. 55,000. What? Yeah. That doesn't make sense. It's mad, isn't it? Yeah, so, but I don't know what, I don't know what to say because this is rubbish. Anyway, anyway, what's website can you buy? Okay, get me a tiger. Here's a grand. Get me a tiger. Although I don't know, you're an idiot. Postage and package isn't. Sorry. So where does the cheapest chimps element come in? Well that's. Aren't you supposed to shout? It's cheap as chimps at the end. Well it isn't. That's why I want to finish the feature. I don't know what. These are the cheapest chimps. Oh, we know. Oh this is amazing. This is amazing broadcasting. So we're up for a Sony award, aren't we? I hope they're listening because it's ours. Yeah, with features like cheap as chips. It's ending because they're not. It's in the bag. And do you remember, do you remember? Here's athlete. Can't stop the spirits when they need. You this life is more than just a read through. Can't stop the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Well, I've got news for you boys, I don't want to stop you. I love your funk rock fusion. Word of warning, no nudity, Repeat, no nudity at this gig. I do it like you. I think you should host a whole show like that. It's lovely that. So have you ever done any like dj, like proper dj, like in a pub or a club? Cuz I know I had my own disco when I was a kid. Yeah, not proper. I, I had a gig once when I had to. It was two nights a week in the local pub. Just the two decks that it was in a suitcase, you know those sort of all in one thing and they just wanted the same records. They wanted Ross Stuart, Baby Jane, they wanted about quarter to 11 when they were drunk. They wanted Don McLean's American Pie which they all sang along to. Uptown Girl they liked. Right. But yeah, I didn't used to do the talking. Did you do the pattern? Don't understand it. I just love those, those wedding sort of DJs that they have to give you extra information. They can't just play a song, they have to say things like oh, all the way back there in the Commodore's easy. It's sort of like they have to tell you something listening. They're just going to play the next record. It's like a wedding. Yeah, there's like a kind of. There's like a, the controller of a local radio station listening. It just happens to be at the wedding thinking hang on, hold on. He's played a record but he's got extra information. Well I should do useful things at a wedding like will the overweight aunt in the purple dress please now take the floor with little unfortunate kid and let him hop around. As the dance floor is currently empty. Will any apes year old boys wearing those tiny tuxedos please slide across the dance floor on their knees until they are taken home and put to bed early. I went to, went to one once and the, the bloke who'd hired it was Grant the DJ. And this, this DJ that come with this sort of party wanted a 70s disco and he looked like Woody Allen, right. And I was sure he used to be a gentleman's outfit as you like and, and he said oh I wanted to 70s disco. And he went well I've got Bicycle Race by Queen lined up, I've got ELO and I've got Cliff where you don't talk anymore. So. And he went well I went sort of more disco. He went I don't really want to blow all me earth, wind and fire before 10. It's like old plan. There are rules. Will the 17 year old girl who's dressed like Avril Lavigne please tut loudly? Because I still haven't played anything by Linkin park. Will the 45 year old woman, recently divorced please cry now? Yeah, please cry now, please cry now. Because it's clear you're never going to find another man. Because you used to be a dj, didn't you? Because there is a sort of rule. Definitely. I remember there was like. You know, what I learned was that you. There are certain tunes you just do not play early on. Oh, what a Night. For instance. Yeah. People. You never play that before like 11. You want that last hour before they've got to go home to be non stop dancing. When would you pop on Dancing Queen. Interesting. Thanks for that. Is there a buffet being served? Yes. Yeah, well, definitely post buffet. I remember there was. There was great days. I was reminded this recently by ITV's Reborn in the USA. There was a great time where you could come out of the buffet or any kind of speech with a bit of Gina G. I remember there was a great period for a couple of years where that was always a barnstormer. Sure, sure. Sadly no longer. What about. Because the dangers, of course, you go back to the 70s, maybe you got Dancing Queen. But how many do you play before you come into the 80s with perhaps. Billie Jean or Soft Sound? Soft Sound is always a classic. Yeah, I'd love to do that. And because there's always controversy now as to whether Love Shack is overplayed. I know that's a big discussion. I've never liked it. I've no. I just like. Will any 35 year old men please now dance ironically to Bombastic in the vain hope that someone would actually find them attractive? What? No, never. Like. I never. I never. Yeah, all right. I just never liked any records that. With a hint of novelty about them. They are popular. They're floor fillers. I. I hate, hate them. I just. You haven't done DJing, have you? Exactly. Yeah. Have you? Yeah. You didn't play Dex's Midnight Runners, probably. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I didn't plan it out that much. When I did it, it was like I knew I had the tights and cigars to give away. Yes, yeah. Which he stole from his parents bedroom beforehand. Why were you giving away stuff at a disco anyway? Why are you just playing records? Because people liked it, didn't they? If it was, it wasn't. It hasn't changed. We're doing this. We talk Rubbish. We play records and we give away crap that we found. Yeah, it hasn't changed, does it? And so I had some good times. I mean, people haven't been listening all the time. It was called Pilk is Making Music. Yeah. It was like Pilkington. And my mate was called Something Making and the music is what we played. Right. And he has some cards made. Made. Had some nice blue glossy cards made. But they were quite expensive. Yeah. So I used to hand them out and then they say, cheers for that and say, no, write it down, write the number down. I want that back. Yeah, brilliant. Because they were quite pricey. Yeah, yeah, Classy, classy businessman there. Amazed. I think Richard Branson used to do that. I think so, yeah. Saved a bit of money because my dad made some. Some lights, honey. He just like he said he made him. He found me a telephone box. Yeah. People were making phone calls in the dark. Yeah, around the neighborhood. Exactly. It's just white bulbs in like a box and. And like me mate making. He used to just flick them on and off at the thing and then they'd be in time with the music and that. Perfect. Well, we had to sit there. I love that. We got a lot. We got our sound alight system. What's his name? Colin. Yeah. Brilliant. Right, so did you ever rent him out? Well, we never had any disasters, right, but we mate did one, right. I don't know if it's that funny really, but it. Well, let's tell you anyway, right? He was doing this gig and it was probably one of the biggest gigs like that he ever had. Must have been a couple of hundred people there and in like a big sort of warehouse thing. Anyway, for some reason there was some problem with a big speaker that fell, right? So the police turn up and stuff, right? And they try to control the night and they're going, can everyone sit down? Can we try to control it? Can you sit down? So anyway, you get a few like little groups of people sitting down on the floor and people were still stood up. And the police were saying, look, you know, we're gonna cancel this whole night if you don't all sit down. And more and more people are sort of sitting down. It's going on for about 20 odd minutes, right, will you please sit down? And it gets to this point when there's just one lad stood up in the middle and he's going, look, you're ruining it for everyone. Will you sit down? It goes quiet for everyone bit and someone's muttering something and he goes, ah, the Lad standing up has got calipers on his legs. Can we have a round of applause. For the kid who said that? It was this lad who was doing the. The dj. He was the dj. So, like, the. Kept the police and everything were saying, well, you sit down. You're ruining it for everyone else, dear. You know, the quick way to sort that would have been or sit down. But most of mine were. I had good nights. Yeah. Always got rebooks and stuff and I. Had a bunch of Venture scapes. Went mental once. Had a food fight. What are you playing Adventure Scouts for? Well, we got booked by everyone, Rick. We. We. I mean, we started with weddings and. And local, you know, things, but we soon went up. We were. I mean, at one point we played a massive gig in a. In a big tent in the middle of nowhere for some scouts and they absolutely loved us. Rage against the Machine. Oh, they couldn't believe their luck. Do you know when they say weddings and bar mitzvahs, do they get a lot of discos playing bar mitzvahs? It. Is that a big. I don't know what happens at a bar mitzvah. Well, I've not. I've not never been to a barometer. Could someone phone. Phone in if you've had a little bar mitzvah, tell me what it was like. What. What sort of. What do you play Bar mitzvah? I don't know what the occasion is, really. It's becoming a man in it. Yeah, all right. We learned something, won't we? Cole and Jo's phone in. Yeah. Do we? I want to know if they have. If they have really do have DJs at bar mitzvahs. All right. Oh, wait. So how interested are you in that? Well, you know, I don't want to embarrass myself one day. Sure. Let's see. Carl, you got to learn, haven't you? I'll tell you what, have we got time for the film thing as well? Yeah, play the film thing now. No, no, no, let's play tune. I can't believe my life Better kill. Yeah, it forest The Cure on XFM 104.9. Wow. Brilliant. Someone called in. She's been to a bar mitzvah and they do have a. Apparently a crap disco and apparently. Well, Carl asked what happens to them? You just sit around and sit. See the. The kid who's getting bar mitzvah or the man now get given loads of money, right. And I said, there's a. A female equivalent. And apparently there is a female equivalent of A bar mitzvah. But she didn't know what it was called. What's that? A Bartitzva. Right, I'm just gonna add to the list of people we've offended. Sorry. To Jewish people as well. Yeah. We've got. So sorry to Jewish people. Sorry to Chinese people. Sorry to Welsh people. People. Ugly fat women. Well, I don't put the Welsh in twice. Sorry to Elvis fans. Elvis fans. Animal lovers. Animal lovers. Brilliant. Well, lovers of great radio. Yeah. Music lovers. Good. Well, sorry about that. Apologies to all of you. Thank. Yeah. And we haven't even had time for. We haven't got time for the film thing this week. Oh, why not? Just it's running. Running tight. Really? Are you sure we haven't done Cheeky Freak of the Week? That's a new feature. Cheeky Freak of the Week. Let's do Cheeky Freak of the Week. What is the Cheekiest Freak of the Week? So I'll make. I'm just going to apologize now. Just add freaks. Sorry to freaks. Okay. Right, go ahead. Well, we've. I mean, we've sort. I say it's a new feature, but we've sort of touched on it in the past with. We always talk about freaks. Hairy Chinese kid. Yeah. We've had the Pillow Man. Yeah. Are you called a draft excluder? Just make a note that. Would you rip on. Yeah. People without arms and legs. But at least you see the Pillow Man. What do you picture? Because I was saying to Ricky in the week, right. I'm a great fan of the Elephant Man. That's his. Do you know that's his favorite freak. Do you know why? He said. Do you know why he said. He said. He said. Because you. You get what you pay for. When someone says the Elephant man, you get what it says on the tin. You know you're gonna get. Said it. Imagine, Steve, if you had a mate. And. And you said, where you going? He said, I'm gonna see me mate. You go, which mate? And he said, the Elephant Man. Yeah. Straight away. You haven't even met him, but you know what he's gonna look like. Yes. Right. That's what I like about that airy Chinese kid. Yeah. You know what you're gonna get? Pillow Man. Pillow Man. Yeah. Not so good. What does that mean? It could be one of those big fat things on that show, couldn't it? A big pillow, like a. Yeah, you know, they had, you know that big thing about the fat people in feeders. They were getting absolutely like 60 stone that we were. And there's there's things called fat admirers that just fancy fat women. Right. And you're writing that down. Yeah, sorry. And they had blow up versions. It looked like a bouncy castle. Wow. Yeah. Really? Yeah. You could blow. You'd be knackered when you blew that up. Yeah. You just wouldn't want to go, forget it. Yeah. Oh God. There's people being cruel as well in it because after watching the program on Channel 4 about the, you know, the fat people and fellas who like them and stuff, there was a story on one of the news websites about some fella in Germany, right. It was a big fella, must have been about 50 stone. And he fell over, right. And I think he hurt his ankle or something and timber. They sent firemen instead of like an ambulance. Yeah. So straight away they're having a bit of a laugh. They're not. No, they've got winching gear. Well, they didn't know they didn't have winching gear. They had to use the hose pipes to carry him out. I think it was ananova, that news website. They had to use the hose pipes. So they made like a bed using the hose pipes. Oh yeah. And had to carry him out on that. And then they had to sort of get him into a special truck, they said. And do the same when they got to the hospital. I mean that's a bit. That's bad, isn't it? It shouldn't do that. Although Carl, I'm loving that story. I'm just worried that we're not gonna be able to fit in. Cheeky freak of the week. Alright, Cheeky freak of the week. Something I found on the net. Fella who had 27 toes and fingers. In a jar. No, still on him. And proper ones as well. Not like little stumps and that. Proper fully formed, formed fingers. He's like. Was he a pianist? Close up magician. I don't know what I did. He just said, that's cradle professional. Did he ever work on finger bobs? He was saying the way for the crowd scenes. I'm now going to do Braveheart. He said about the Elephant Man. He said, I want to do a thing, right, with freaks where it's good and bad. He went, what? You said the pro about him is. What about the fellow with loads of fingers or. No, the Elephant Man. Well, he said the bad thing is he stretches his jumpers. When he puts them on. And that's the good thing. Sort of. He never gets up and goes, oh, my hair's a bit of a mess today. No, he's always having another bad face day. I don't complain about this head and shoulders. Are you taking the piss? Oh, dear. So that's freaky. Didn't you see an elephant woman in Manchester? Yeah, Leave that. What do you mean, leave it? No, because it. It is sad. I know it's sad, but. But I mean, I don't know what my next sentence is. That should be the end. They don't need to say anymore. People will know what she looks like. It's a good name for her. Did she like. But oh dear. It was when me. It's when my dad was a taxi driver and he used to sit in the front. Yeah, and she used to get a lot of taxis and. And he only charged you half price, didn't he? He was a good guy. Well, the bad thing is as well. With people like that, you don't want to offend them because they never forget. Oh, go, go, Pilkington. I was in. I was sat in the front of the cab and my dad goes, right, we're gonna go and pick the. The, you know, the. I can't even tell you the name. These guys just evil. What do you mean? No, leave it. So she's got. No, no, no. Carl, tell me what he said. No, you've already stitched him up. He's Steven Things from Little Welsh fellows. Right? What did he call her? Steve? Back to him. It's a really good doctor. Our opinion of him is already pretty low. Look, tell me what he said. No, it's not. I'm scared of what my dad gets. It's the person who's got the shit. She's not listening, is she? Well, her headphones wouldn't fit on her headphones. Tell me what he called there. I don't want to. Tell me what he called her. Carl, I'm getting angry, man. Tell me what he called her. No, I'll leave that. Honestly. Tell me what he. It doesn't matter. Tell me what he called her. Carl, just. I'm going to go. I want to tell you what he called her. Right? You're not going to stop this show. We're not doing the next show until. Tell me what he called her. What did your father call the elephant head woman? Tell me, Spad, how old were you? I don't know, about nine. So did you expect to see a potato with a dress? Yes, he did, sort of. Again, it's a good name. Do you know what I mean? I had an idea of what it was going to be about and he said, do you want to stay in the car, take you home because you can't spud heads. You got lovely eyes. Come on, man. That's it, by the way, is that. Bye. Brilliant. Well, let's end with our local J. Yeah. See you next week. Don't call it a comeback. I've been here for years. I'm back in my.",
