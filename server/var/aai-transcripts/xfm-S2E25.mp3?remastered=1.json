Steve Merchant, Carl Pilgerton. All right, all right. Yeah. Well, we got a jam packed show today. We got. We got. Oh, we got so many feet. We got more features than Carl's got on his face, which is about the same as Morph. Yeah, very few. It's just really ahead, isn't it? A little. That's where I've seen him before. More on Take Heart. Yeah, yeah. We've got Rockbusters. That's still going. No, my feelings on that. No, but he said he's gonna buck his ideas up. We've got. Oh, Chimpanzee, that's Carl finds an amusing monkey or ape. Related story. We've got Khan in a film again. Right, excellent. Yeah, we've got a lot of great response from that Carl on the Internet. It was my favorite thing we did. People raving about that. So what can we say? What the film is, Excuse my French. We've got some bloody great music. Oh, pardon et moir. I don't know, I got to be French. Well, I'll just give you a taste. We got Oasis, Cardigans, you just heard there. We got Lloyd, Carl. We got bit of Pretenders coming. Eminem, Feeder, Coldplay, all the greats. Club la, some TJ fan club later. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What do we have now? Oasis. Go on. Yeah, brilliant. Oasis and Songbird. It's a nice little Diffie. All right. Yeah. Of a Saturday. Yes, thank you. Xfm 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. I. I think we should go straight into it, Carl. I think you should. We should do the competition that the. There's Carl in the corner. It seems a little premature. Do you reckon? Yeah, it's so good. We should. We should tease it out. It's. It's a big. It's a big thing. It's just that I've got absolutely nothing to say. I've. Sure I haven't really. Well, I mean, often. I know you all have spoken to Carl in the week this week for some reason. I've been speaking to him. All right. I spoke briefly to him about Michael Jackson, the documentary. Now, of course, I thought that was extraordinary and I am. And he didn't mention to me the fact that Michael Jackson likes to climb up in trees. He didn't mention anything. About his bizarre relationship with children. He didn't mention anything about his obsessive billionaire spending sprees. He didn't mention anything about the mannequins he has in his thing. Or the fact that he drives around his seven hotel suites in Las Vegas in a little kind of old people's scooter. The only thing of note for Carl was he said to me, did you notice how big his hands are? I tell you what, though, I did. What how you look at. The man's got like a face that he's had reconstruct. Well, I can't say that's libelous. Yeah. He's had two face jobs. Yeah. And you're looking at his hand. But I think it's because you look at him and he looks a bit like. There's a bit of androgyny there, but it's sort of like a. It is quite a petite sort of old lady's face in a way. But then you see these laborers hands come out. That's always the way with a tranny, isn't it? You know, I mean, him of being a tranny. No, he's not. No, no, he's not. He's got enough issues. Now you're accusing him of being. I like him. I thought he came out that brilliant. I. I thought it was really. I really felt sorry for him. And no, I think he cleared up a few things as far as I'm concerned. I thought it was a fascinating piece of work. But I did like the shopping spree. That was great pointing. I know it's. It was bad taste, wasn't it? It was like one of those bizarre shops, you know, I mean, there's anything. Sort of a gift shop, but they're trying to make like men. But if. Yeah, I mean, sprayed gold. If he'd been living in a trailer park, he'd have been ordering, you know, one of those porcelain dolls dressed like a Harley Davidson bike rider or, you know, an Elvis commemorative plate. It was the kind of billionaire equivalent of that. But the hands were a giveaway. It's the same as those sort of transvestites. You know, when you get like a cab driver or something, right? And he decides to turn transvestite about 60. And he goes on Kilroy, they got a twin set of pearls. And he goes, I've never felt so comfortable. But his hands are still big. He's got a little wig and he's got the lipstick on. And he's with his teenage kids who are going, kill me. Do you think he's been having surgery on his hands to make them larger. Yeah. Is that why he was wearing that glove? You're mostly here. Exactly. I think he wants to be a goalkeeper. Right. And they said, you can't, Michael. You've got a big hand. He would help him climb the trees. Yeah, yeah. And he can play tennis now without a racket. Yeah. What did you make of it, Carl? Were you intrigued? The Michael Jackson thing, you know, it's all right, but like, that got a load of attention in the press, but the Trisha program got nothing. Okay. Which I know, like. Well, Steve called me up in the week, right. Like 10:00 in the morning, I was at work. And he goes, At 10 o'clock, preparing. This show, most people go to work about eight or nine. You're watching Trisha and that. I said, no, what is it? He goes, oh, you'll be loving it. Right. Freaks, was it? Help me, my mum's a freak. Siamese twins. So I couldn't watch it, but he said, oh, it might be on again because they Repeat stuff on ITV2. So I had me dinner late. Instead of having it at like 1:00 like I normally do, I had it at like 2:30, sat in the office, put the telly on ITV2. These Siamese twins, did it blow your mind? It was amazing. You know, we talk about a lot of things on the show. Quite a lot. The airy kids crop up a lot. I was waiting. It's been 10 minutes. Minutes, and you haven't mentioned the airy kid. Right. And last week we were talking about Siamese twins, weren't we? So it was. It was weird that this program was on, but it was amazing. I mean, what. I think you can't refer to them as Siamese twins. I think they're known as conjoined twins. Why? I think. I think Siamese is maybe considered derogatory or as an antiquated phrase. Yeah. I think it's because the first famous ones were actually from Siam. And that doesn't exist anymore. No, it's conjoined, Carl. Yeah. Get the phrase. Right. But you think that if that's happened to you, that wouldn't be that sort of offensive. The names that you must get called. Right. You think that's twins? I'd say. Well, that's. Yeah. Now, were you stunned by where they were connected? Just live with it. We'd say, right. Because they were connected, of course. At the forehead. Oh, sort of. Which was quite, quite extraordinary. God, what if one had bad breath? That wasn't a question that Trisha asked, annoyingly, because I know that much of the audience was thinking that a few. Things that didn't crop up. What questions would you have asked of them? Because what things did you feel weren't mentioned? I'd love to just watch Carl watching amazing things. Exactly. Do you know what I mean? It's like, like early learning. Mouth slightly open. Yeah, mouth open, dribble. Looking around to see if anyone else has seen it. Like when a cat sees a bird land on the balcony. Can't believe it's luck. I'd probably say. How do you buy a. Like a birthday present? Surprise gift. Yeah. Because everything's ruined. Sure. I'd probably ask. Yeah. Well, did you not think it was interesting that one of them had a boyfriend? Well, that was a bit weird, wasn't it? Uh huh. But what was the other thing that I was thinking when I was watching? It was thinking if one got into crime and that was sent to prison, right. What would happen? How would he handle that? It's brilliant. It's brilliant if a chimp could talk. And what was the other one? The other thing was, what did he talk about? Because it's not as if you can say, oh well, guess what I did today? Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Brass in pocket. And if they're pretending to be good, they're doing a bloody good job of it. I love them. Xfm 104.9 with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl is still buzzing about these conjoined twins. It's just one of them, of course. Had to be because one of them was sort of shorter than the other and had to be sort of wheeled around on a kind of trolley thing by the other. This isn't Molly and Dolly, is it? No, they're not. One's called Reba. Oh, I forget what the other one's called. Sheena maybe or something like that. Do you remember Carl? No, I wasn't that impressed with the names. It's just. Yeah. So you immediately put them out of your mind. Those are rubbish names. I'm Forget, forget, forget Carl, forget. They're gone. Were they British or American? Yeah, American. Oh, because I've seen some Americans. One of them was a. Apparently a country music star. This is Wally and Dolly. Well, they're not called the one that. Joined at the oid. I think you've made up the Molly and. No, it was on Jerry Springer. There's a little one that sits on a seat and the other one carries it round her around and they're not. Called Molly and Dolly. There was something like that. They're called. Well, we know that one of them is called Reba, and I forget one. Of the country and western single Time. But she was saying, yeah, I've just made a movie, it's coming out shortly in theaters. Yeah. And the other one said, oh, I'm not involved. It's utterly bizarre because they live there. They work so hard to live their lives separately. Yeah. They say, of course, you know, they try not to sort. So she's talking about her music career and the other one's sort of not taking any kind of credit for, which is nice. It's weird, though, because when she was singing as well, the other one just stands there. She doesn't join in. She doesn't sort of dance off her backing vocals. Do you know what I mean? Make a group out of it. A duo. Yeah, well, but it seems like we sort of being horrible. But we're not. No, we're not. We're laughing at Carl's amazement at this phenomenon. Sorry, I just got to say, we're not. We're not, you know, taking the mickey. The really weird thing about all this, and it's annoying because you were saying about, you know what, should have Trisha have asked and all that, but one of them mentioned that one of them was adopted and the other one wasn't. Don't talk rubbish. No, seriously, I didn't understand it. Right, because you didn't. And then Trisha thought I said, well, let's have a chat. And. And they were like, no, don't want to go into that. What do you mean one was adopted? That's what he said. One of them. I don't. Don't quiz me on it. But that's what was. That's what was said. Hi there. I may. Hello there. I'm a multi millionaire. I've just seen your orphanage. Oh, yeah. One of your children. You'd like to adopt one. I'd love to adopt a children. I've got loads from around the world, so I'd love to adopt one. I'd give you $10,000. We're speeding through then. Yeah, we've actually got two left. I need one. I'm only interested. Yeah, I don't need anymore. Don't need any sisters. I know it'd be tragedy to break them up, but I really need one now. Break up. There's the. There's the rub, you see. Sure. Because I just need the one. There's $10,000 now. You can have that I'll sign it now, but I don't discuss it for you. I'll bring her around. I'll bring it. Brilliant. Okay. Ding dong. Hi. Yeah, brilliant. You brought my kid, right? Yeah. There she is. There. That's. Enjoy. Yeah. Yeah. Just standing next to a bush. Yeah. Do you wanna. Can you bring her out? No, there's nothing behind the bus. So just. You just want. I want to be able to. I just want to be able to walk 360 degrees round her. Do you want it or not? Yes. I can't believe it. What's that little trolley? She's talented. Oh dear. You're talking nonsense, Carl. Well, whatever. These ideas are nightmares. The white cameras whose worst fear was a child with dyed hair. Feeder. That's it. Just the way I'm feeling. XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervaise. Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. It's time for the the newest quiz in town. This is where Carl inserts himself into a seminal film. Last week he was the little kid in Sixth Sense. You remember. To a great acclaim. The critics loved it, they said. A triumph. This week he's fiddled with the Graduate. This is the scene where of course he goes upstairs to the hotel room and he's. It's on the cards. She's a dead sir. Mrs. Robinson. Well, here we go then. So, you ready for it? And I've brought some condoms from home that Suzanne got for Christmas. Benjamin. What? Will you bring me a hanger? A what? A hanger. Tell you what, I've. I've got wood. What? Just saying, I've got wood. I've got metal ones as well. What sort do you want? Either one will be fine. Alright. There you go. Are you afraid of me? Er, no. No. I've seen weirder things than you. Have I ever told you about the two lads I went to school with who had big heads. Web fingers as well. Not related and weren't mates but both had the same thing, which is a bit weird. Yeah. I never found out what was wrong with them. Can I ask you a personal question? As long as it's not about me Ed, being round. Cause Ricky's always going on about that saying I've got around Ed. Well, you can admit that, can't you? No, it's. I'd say it's a normal sort of shape. It's just round. It is, isn't it? Yeah, but what. What do you mean? So is yours. Heads should be round. There's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm not ashamed. It's just a normal shape. Mm. And you can talk. Look at your saggy arse. Anyway, get your knickers off. Hello, Darkness, my old friend. Oh, that was a joy. Oh, dear. It's an absolute treat. Now, I should say that obviously the prize is a copy of the Graduate. Now, bear in mind that XFM is giving away these prizes. Carl is so cheap that he wouldn't even buy it on DVD. He's bought it for $6.99 on VHS. It will be panned and scanned. It won't be widescreen. There's none of the extra features that you get on the dvd. Look at Carl's face. He's got it. Kyle, did you pocket the rest of the cash? No. No, I have to use my own money to buy these. Right. You're using your own money to give this stuff away. Yeah. So I had to go and buy that. XFM is so cheap. I understand. Right. And it's not worth having it on dvd, is it? It's an old film. So. So the quality is. Is. Do you know what I mean? They can't really tidy it up. Of course they can. They do it from a print. They don't do it from the video. They don't get. They don't get the video and go, let's make it into a DD copy. That someone had kn. Well, anyway, it's the same film though, isn't it? Fine. Okay. Well, you're right. Yes. But anyway, you can win 6.99's worth of the Graduate. The question. And it's email only. Steve. Steve. It's not Steve. It's ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk the question is name the actor that Carl was taking the place of in the film and of course, the actress that he's performing opposite. Ricky.gervaisxfm.co.uk. Lovely. Do you want to play something from there? I would love to. It would seem appropriate. Yeah. Hello, Darkness, my old friend of silence. Dear Mr. Simon and Mr. Garfunkel, please, let's not have the sound of silence. Let's have some more beautiful music. Get that together, please, quickly. I think you should do every single liquor. It's the best bit of the show. On XFM 104.9. Are we gonna have time to play the clip again before. I don't know, before 2:00, let's say. Are people not listening to the question? Is that what you are? Some people are not listening to the question. Oh, dear. Okay, we'll play it again at about. 2 then personally any excuse to hear it again. Because I thought. I think Carl should go out and get the dvd. I think it's embarrassing to give away the. Yeah, you have to get it. You have to go out and buy the DVD later. Carl. On the DVD it's got a booklet, it's got an audio commentary, it's got behind the scenes features and it's got this pristine widescreen version of the film. You've got some cheap £6.99 version. Yeah. And so because you were being mean because it was your own money, you're gonna have to. You're gonna have to waste that now because no one wants it. So it's going to cost you twice as much as it would have done if you just got the DVD the first time round. Valuable. Lesson learned. Rewound it. There's a penalty if you've not. No, you haven't rewound it. Go and get the DVD later. This we're. They're going to win a DVD. No, I looked at the DVD and it was 18 quid and claim it back. No, you've got to wait. What a cheap station this is. It's like rig. I mean, do you want to go. On with the other prizes with what we're giving away later? What is this for Rockbusters? Well, we don't give away prizes, we throw away prizes. Yeah, cleaning out some drawers in xfm. Go on. I'm just having a quick look through before I. Because we've sort of revamped Rockbusters a bit. There's that extra bit in it now, isn't there? That audio bit. You're selling it. You're big. A big cell. I've not gone straight into that yet. There's a dvd. There's a DVD there. What's that? I'll go through them later, Rick. I just need to absorb of it. Don't get excited. So who did Carl play in the clip? What actors place did he take and what actress played opposite him? That's ricky.gervais. Xfm.Co.Uk sure. Brilliant. Yeah. Is that it then? What we got coming up, we got. Some play a bit of Coldplay. Let's have a bit of Coldplay. Right. How they shine for you, all the things that you do. Coldplay yellow on XFM 104.9. Get it on DVD. It's an embarrassment. Seven quids worth of old video pan and scanned. I bought it now that's what they're getting. Right. It put a downer on it. All the work, you know, that went into that. And then just gonna fob them off with a bit of old celluloid, like that. Listen, still to come, right, we've got the. The monkeys thing. Oh, chimpanzee that. And when I was out last Sunday, right, at Johnny's birthday party. Yeah. Steve was there. Yeah. Got talking about stuff and a debate that we didn't really finish. Crop top. It blew your mind, didn't it? Amazing. Oh, I know about this. Steve told me. This is the infinite amount of monkeys or a monkey with a typewriter. An infinite amount of time would eventually come up with the works of Shakespeare. Yeah. There was no debate. It's a philosophical mathematical problem. There's no debate. It's true. It wouldn't happen. No, listen, Carl, listen. Infinity sorts it all out for you, right? An infinite amount of monkeys at a time. I would do. They do everything. They type everything. Infinity just sorts it all out for you. There's no getting to it. And they're going, oh, well, let's have a look what they've done. This one's come close. Did Romeo and Julio. It would do it all. It would try everything ever possible conceivable. Yeah. It's a mathematically finished. Well, we heard your side of the argument, and I'll be honest with you, it's a persuasive one. But let's hit Carl because he heard about this in a pub last week. Yeah. So you've got some strong words. What's your problem with it? What's your problem with it? Well, first of all, right, you're saying it's a load of monkeys. It's not just one monkey. That's depends. No, no, wait, wait, wait. It's either a chimpanzee with a typewriter with an infinite amount of time, he would eventually, by definition, mathematically type everything ever possible. Okay? Or it's an infinite amount of chimps with typewriters and one of them will type it first time. But already. That's. That's sort of. That's not right. You either need to have. What do you mean? What you mean employment laws? What do you mean it's not right? Let's hear him out, please. If it's one monkey. Yeah. With a typewriter that's got loads of ink in it and that. Right. At least it knows what it's done in the past, don't. It's not. Keep going crying if you've got a load of monkeys. It's like. It's like if you have too many. What's that saying about too many chefs. Too many chimps, boil of soup. Right. Well, it's the same thing. It's like, well, I didn't tell you to put salt in it. I was gonna put salt in it and it messes it up. Whereas if it's just one, they know what's gone on. So what I'm saying is I can't be bothered. This blows my mind that he doesn't know what this does to me. It's a mathematical problem. I want to hear the rest. Well, it's just that I just don't think it will happen. What do you mean you don't think it'll happen? Infinity works it out for you by definition. Well, what's stopping them typing the same thing again? They would. In fact, the problem should be if you had an infinite amount of time that it would type that works for Shakespeare. An infinite amount of times and everything else an infinite amount of times. But you know, that's not. That's just. That's. That's not as. But not. Not Shakespeare. Oh, shut up, you idiot. Rick, do you know what he said to me? I said to him, I explained it to him. I said, you've got an infinite number of monkeys, infinite number of typewriters, they will type the complete words of Shakespeare. He said, have they read Shakespeare? You're an idiot. I'm not having this conversation. I'm not having it. I'm not having it because it really, really winds me up. But you're saying they'll do it with no spelling errors. They do it an infinite amount of times and they do it wrong an infinite amount of times. And they do it and they spell the last wrong an infinite amount of times. And they do it. And they get one thing wrong in Hamlet. Wrong an infinite amount of times. They do everything an infinite amount of times. But are they going off a story that they've clear record? Carl, because I'm gonna knock you out. I'm just saying. Shut up. Do they know the story? Oh, they're monkeys. Oh, Christ. Okay, she's a girl and I'm a man. Good, that innit. From XFM 104.9, Ricky J. Steve Merchant. Kyle Pilkington. As ever, Rick, there's always someone who steps in to defend Carl. Okay, what is the defence? What is the defence? Here's an email from Scott Coomer. He says Carl is actually right. I've got an A level in statistics and probability. It doesn't matter how long they have and how many monkeys you have. You Cannot guarantee they would type the complete works of Shakespeare. Infinity makes it probably. They would get it right, but not definite. Yeah, well, yeah, yeah, that's what I was saying. No, no, you weren't saying. Carl, you don't understand it. Infinity sort of sorts it out. That if they do. If they do. If they do anything, they're nearly do everything, won't they? No, I mean, they'll give it a good shot. No, that's not the point. But I wouldn't be surprised if they did one page. Right, right, listen. It's not to do with consciousness, it's not to do with them aiming. They are just bashing away. It's like that. They're used to show that there isn't consciousness. They. They. They chose the chimpanzee because it can type. Presumably it's because the keyboard, because they. Hadn'T come across you at the time. Yeah, yeah. It's to take out thought out of it. It's to take out reason and trying. Right. It's just random. They're saying that if you typed enough things, if the computer was never typing everything, if you left it for an infinite amount of time, and they chose Shakespeare because there is meaning behind it and it's difficult to get it exactly right. To show you that infinity would come up with a. It's not just Shakespeare, it's every novel. It's everything. Fairly eloquent there. From Javiz. A quick riposte, please, from Carl Pilkington. No, I'm just saying what I don't understand. If it hasn't read it, then how does it know where it's going? Oh, I. Listen, right, okay, listen, right. Can I just explain to people, right, Some people have said, oh, why are you crawling to Carl? It drives me mental with things like that. What do you mean? Well, I just. Let me just take a breather. How do I do your heading? It keeps coming in the week. You know that I work here properly. Yeah, in the week, don't I? I've got a proper job, yeah, yeah. Nine to five. But I normally get in about 8:00. And a lot of people getting 8:00. Working hard, trying to do my job. Three times this week I've been rushing around to walk past me little studio. He's sat in there. All right now, because I've got this sort of job, I can get away with it. I said to him, if I was a doctor, would he keep coming to me practice? If you were a doctor, there'd be severe problems with the nhs. Oh, Imagine that the standards would have lowered so much. If you can arrive at the hospital, you're a doctor. Well, pop in. I'll go to lunch. Don't we. We have a little lunch bag, don't we? I go, come on, let's go. Now he goes, I'm busy. Come on, let's go. Now he's going, oh, you're doing me, Eddie. Well, when I was talking about the monkey conundrum with Carl, he said to me, right, if I had a day off work and I was, say, watching the tv and with one hand I was typewriter, would I type Shakespeare? I mean. Yeah, but you see, there's certain things. We were talking a little bit about this stuff the other week, weren't we? When we said you were going on about Einstein. And I said, he's not that good. You know, E equals MC squared. You know, it sounds good, but I've never used it in that way. I've never used it. You haven't used two and two equals four. Carl, the fellow with an apple fell on his head. You know, it could have been anyone sat under that tree. Do you know what I mean? It's just annoying. Newton gets all the credit for his laws of the universe. Well, a lot of people were working whilst he was having a lunch break under the street. So in a way, it's like he didn't deserve to have that success story again. Forget the apple and the tree and whether he was sitting down having lunch break. It's totally irrelevant. Yeah, but what I'm saying is there's certain things that will just happen, you know, it's like. I think we were talking when we were out eating the other week, we were talking about Noel Gallagher. Well, this is reason that the monkey discussion came up, right? We were. Noel Gallagher. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say, Rick. I don't want to miss quote. I mean, Herbert Lahm in Cluso. I'm gonna get a twitch whenever he opens his mouth. I don't know what. I don't know. I don't know where to start with some of his statements. Well, as I say this, all this discussion began because we were talking about a quote that Noel Gallagher supposedly gave. Now, I don't want to misquote Gallagher, but the gist of it was that he said, had I written Wonderwall or whatever, instead of the Beatles writing Strawberry Fields, whatever, I'd be the one that was considered the great songwriter. And it wouldn't be the Beatles. You know, it's Just the fact that they came first, that meant that they get all the credit as being the greatest band. I don't know where to start with that statement either. I mean, that's Gallagher's thing. And he's, you know. Well, whatever. We know what you think we think of that. What was your point, Carl? You agreed with him, didn't you? Yeah, I reckon. Right. Do you know we've talked about putting a baby in a room before, and he'll know what color it is and stuff. If you got a room that's painted red, right? But forget that because that's gonna confuse me. Say, if they did some new TV show, right, like, what's that film with Jim Carrey in where The. The Truman Show. The Truman show, right, so they make up a little room and some woman has some kids. And you say, right, let's put the kids in this room. And they don't know what's going on outside. They don't know anything about, like, EastEnders and that. It's like their little world, right? They don't know anything that's gone on. How could a child survive without EastEnders? Right, listen, so you sat in the room, right? And then when they're all asleep, wait for this bit. Someone. Have you heard this? Yeah. Wait for this bit. They're all in a room. Yeah? They're asleep, yeah. Someone pops in, puts a guitar next to the bed, right? Nips off out again. They wake up in the morning and one of them goes, what's this? They don't even know it's a guitar because they've never seen one. Right? They're talking English, though. Yeah. We just left guitar out of the vocabulary, right? So there's plenty more to come. So one of them will pick it up and they'll go, I don't know what it is. And they'll start strumming. They'll go, that sounds good, doesn't it? Give them a few weeks. They could come up with hey Jude. Whereas saying type in Shakespeare, a monkey that can't even spell. I see that. I might come with you. Christy. Special as well. Yeah, no, sure, sure. I'm sh. Off in as well. Cheers. Flaming Lips Yashimi battles the Pink robots and XFM 104.9 before the ad break. Steve Miller Band Fly Like An Eagle Great track. Lovely to hear that. Brilliant track. We're not scared of playing that sort of stuff, are we? Indeed. We've got some great. I think we're underestimated here. People think we're just like, you know, two guys And a buffoon in a room. But it's so much more than that. We, you know, we try and put together a whole package for them for their Saturday afternoon listening pleasure. There's an infinite number of us, three in an infinite. In an infinite number of studios broadcasting for an infinite number of shows. Would we ever do anything half decent? Yeah, we eventually. Would we ultimately come up with something quite. What was that email that you were laughing at? I can. It's too rude. What does it say? It's too nasty. Oh God, give me the gist of it. The gist of it was that it would mean that if there was that infinite number of monkeys, eventually, besides the fact that they would type the complete works of Shakespeare, they would also type the sentence Carl Pilkington is a genius. But the email also said it would also type Ricky Gervais is a. I can't say the word but. I know. Yeah, but the number of times they type it and write Carl Pilgrim is a genius and Ricky Gervais is a cund. Exactly. Yeah. That would be there a lot. Before we carry on with anything, I should just tell you we're on the subject of emails. There's one emailer we're always looking forward to hearing from. Dickers, Richie Anderson, Dicky Docky Do. Richard Anderson. Thanks for emailing. He's my biggest fan. He's one of the biggest fans. Absolutely loves me, but not afraid to. Offer some constructive criticism. Go on. That's the great thing about Dickie. And from Anders this week. He says, ricky, I'm lazy, I talk nonsense, I'm badly organized and I believe in ghosts. Can I have a job working on your show? Possibly Anders, maybe send in a CV or email. A cv? He's got a little bit of all of us in that, hasn't he? Asked him if he's a goggle eyed freak. Steve. All right, calm down. No, I didn't mean there's any ticket. I didn't necessarily mean you, did I? To get nasty. Well, I was thinking about that actually, Steve. Oh God. Just talking of. Of the old. What? What? Talking of the what? No, do you know, like it's better be good. No. You don't have that many girlfriends. What? What do you mean? Carl, why are we on this? I wasn't. I was defending you in the whole monkey discussion. Come on, what's your point? What's your point? What's your point? What's the point? What's the point? I just was thinking if there was. An infinite number of Steves. You know, you're an odd looking fella. Come on, Carl, get to the. No, you know I know that. I've told you that loads of times. What do you mean, you know I know that. Well, there's no point pretending anymore, Steve. I'm. I'm flabbergasted. But also, you don't like spending money, right? He's mean and weird looking. Valentine's Day. Are you? Sort of. You know, you've got to love him though, haven't you? What? What? Are you happier with the fact that no girls like you enough? Right. This is really mental. Or are you happy because you don't have to spend any money on a card for someone? A little from column A, a little from column B. Wait, let's have more monkey news. What have we got? No, wait. We've got so much to get into this show. Insults. I think we've got enough. We don't need the insults. No more insults. No more insults. Me with Carly's. You know he's been planning that. No, I haven't. I was. Well, I was thinking about on the way in because Valentine's Day is coming up and I'm not a big fan of it. Condoms? You bought your girlfriend a box of condoms for Christmas? I don't think you can ever go at me, to be fair. No, but I don't just treat her on Valentine's. I'm always. Do you know what I mean? You don't even treat her on Valentine's. You don't even treat her at Christmas or on her birthday. When do you treat her? Hang on a minute. Wait a cotton picking minute there. Why I order. Wait a minute. What was that? Tiffany dog. I treat your girlfriend better than you and I've only met her twice. I took her out last night and she enjoyed herself. Where'd you go? Until she had to write the check. Where do you go? Where'd you go? To a chippy. A really high record. To a chippy. Quality one right under a fiber for. Two wrapping, not newspaper grease bre paper. On bread and bread. Ash and sometimes on XFM 104.9. I'm looking at your. With me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. We've got so much to get through. All right, all right, all right. London's, innit? Sorry? Swear on air. On air. My studio. Never, never swear on an on air studio. Yeah, apologies. It's not really swearing, is it? I'll tell you what swearing is. So, yeah, graduate, you're gonna play that again and give a winner. Give a winner. Well, let's hear it. So it's Carl Pilkington featuring in the Graduate. It. Yeah. Well, here we go then. So, you ready for it? And I've brought some condoms from home that Suzanne got for Christmas. What? Will you bring me a hanger? A what? A hanger. Tell you what, I've. I've got wood. What? Just saying. I've got wood. I've got metal ones as well. What sort do you want? Either one would be fine. All right. There you go. Are you afraid of me? No. No. I've seen weirder things than you. Have they ever told you about the two lads I went to school with who had big heads? Web fingers as well? Not related and weren't mates, but both had the same thing, which is a bit weird. Yeah. I never found out what was wrong with them. Can I ask you a personal question? As long as it's not about me, Ed, being round. Because Ricky's always going on about that, saying I've got around Ed. Well, you can admit that, can't you? No, it's. I'd say it's a normal sort of shape. It's just round. It is, isn't it? Yeah, but what? What do you mean? So is yours, Ed should be round. There's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm not ashamed. This just a normal shape. Mm. And you can talk. Look at your saggy arse. Anyway, get your knickers off. Hello, darkness, my old friend. Oh, dear. A classic. An Oscar winning classic. Oh, Carl Pilkington in the Graduate. But what was the question, Steve? The question was, which actor was Carl Pilkington taking the role of? Well, that's easy. Which. I know that. Was he performing opposite? I know that. And the answer is Ricky Hoffman. And Bancroft. And Bancroft. Dustin hoffman. And the 699 VHS cassette is going to Laura Gomez because she says that she'd be happy with the vhs, not the dvd, so best of luck to her. I hope she enjoys that. All right. Yeah. What we do next week, I've got loads of. I quite like hearing Carl in a sort of seductive environment. It gives you another insight into. It gives you another dimension. I know. ET it is then. Exhibit X and the track X. Have you seen Eight Mile? Really? I really enjoyed it. You'll notice exhibit makes a little cameo in there. Yeah. And that last bit, that. That wrap off at the end was lovely. It was so. It was just like. It was like Rocky or something. Should we have a wrap off? Maybe next week? Yeah. Yeah. Let's try and master the art of talking civilly to each other first before we start making it rhyme. Rockbusters, Carl. Yeah. I'm not a champion of Rockbusters, as you know, but I think it's overstayed its welcome. But. Well, I think Carl's just giving the fans what they want here. Okay. It's a popular thing in it. Got some good prizes behind it. Let me tell you what the prizes are. It's a dance music compilation. Cream trance anthems 2003. I play a lot of trance on this. Well, I put that on quite a lot. There's the original motion picture soundtrack to the forthcoming film adaptation. When you've seen the film, I'm sure that will mean more to you. You like that, don't you? It's a good movie. Yeah. Nicolas Cage and a twin brother. And it's written by Spike, it's directed by Spike Johns. Joined at the what? No, no, they're not joined at the hip at all. Or at the face. And we've also got the best one Hit wonders album in the world ever. What we got on there, we've got things like the Crazy World of Arthur Brown. Brilliant. Nina99, red balloons, the Rembrandt. In fact, it kicks off with Naina. Sure. That's followed up by I'll Be There for you, the theme from Friends by the Rembrandts. And of course, Breakfast at Tiffany's by Deep Blue Something. Brilliant. Deep Blue Something. Is that the worst name ever? I think it possibly is. No, Sixpence. That's a pretty bad name. Okay, again we. I know we've got a lot of chill out fans who listen to us. The best Chill out album ever. Bear in mind, of course, all these prizes collated by Carl from, I guess People's drawers in the drawer. Look in the drawer. Oh, deary me. What is it? The only thing probably worth having is a. I mean, it's topical, if Nothing else. Carl. A 7 inch by the white Stripes. Merry Christmas from the White Stripes. That was their exclusive Christmas single. So if that's early in. Is worth it. A lot of people gotta wait 11 months before that's released. Or is it last Christmases Things, aren't they? And I have never heard of this dvd. I like to think of myself as being fairly familiar with TV and films, but I have never heard of Stephen King's Rose Red. Welcome to a place evil calls home. And it's on DVD. It's certificate 12, so don't imagine anything too shocking. And it looks appalling. Is Rose Red Mansion truly haunted? To find out, Professor. Okay, we've got the gist of it. They're not very good prizes. They're cosmetic. Hobble together. But if you've got nothing better to do, call in if you know the answers to these clues. It's Rockbusters. Let's not let them call in. Rick. There's people calling. It's email only, Carl. Don't interrupt me. I'm just. Yeah. Ricky.gervais xfm.co.uk email only. I can't stress that enough. We just don't want to speak to you people. Right, so I give some initials out and a cryptic clue and it makes up the answer. Well, sometimes it does. Yeah, go on. Two of them. There's a new aspect which I'll explain about in a minute. So the first one is cryptic clue is. Well, if you would have been wearing an helmet, it would have been alright. And the initial there is B. Right. So, well, if you would have been wearing an helmet, he would have been. All right, B. Right, Band or an artist. Second one. Why are them Jamaican fellas Swinging fish around their head? Okay, all right. Initials. Fills me with DS DS Why them Jamaican men swinging fish around their head all right, and the final bit. Two Rockbusters. It's a new bit. Last week I played you this. Look at his face. Goes along with it. That's. That's someone beating up a dog. That was smack My Bitch up. Right, so here's some sound effects on that and they make up a song. I can listen to him too. Let's have a listen to the effects. That's terrifying. Right, I told you not to play that one. It's rubbish. No one will get that. Well, we'll see. I heard that a couple of weeks ago. I said it's rubbish. Now I'm going to get it. No, it's not the one you think it is. Ah, right, so email in ricky.gervaisfm.co.uk, and you win that song. I'm a little bit confused. I'm here. I've heard what you're saying. We've discussed this in the past. I don't know what's happening. What's that? Is that a clue? That's a cryptic clue. That's that screaming to a song. Is it screaming? Well, don't say it. It should stand up by itself. Don't give them any clue. Hang on a sec, hang on a sec. So this is the name of a song. It's not a band or an artist. So the first two bands Are artists. And the. The last one is the name. I said we should abandon this. I said we should just pack it in. What, the show? Yes. Is someone talking? I'm looking at his face. His headphones are too loud. Instead of turning them down, he's just grimacing, going, these are too loud. I don't understand it. How have you lived this long? How did you make it to 30 without getting squashed or eating something deadly poisonous? I told you, I used to choke a lot. We've had an email from Placebo, the Bitter End. We've had an email from Andrew Forrest, who has just simply entitled it Carl Pilocton. Oh, Carl Pillockton. What do you think of that? That's got to be your new name from now on. Oh, I had a mate who. Who used to use it. What used to call you that? Was that your nickname at school? No, it's not my nickname. It is now. No, it's not. It is now. Pilicton Pelleton. Oi, oi, Pilockton, Pillockton. Do my homework. Where do you live? Where do you come from? Pillockton. No, it's this lad who called Mark, right, who he used to go to school with, who used to call me that. And his mum, right, was like, obsessed with cleaning. And I was never allowed in their flat. He makes the place look untidy. So she used to. I don't know if it was just me or all his mates, but I used to turn up and she goes, yeah, he is in, but you know what you got to do. And I used to have to go round the side of his flat and he had a computer, right, which he used to play. I didn't have one at that point, but he had one. And I used to have to go around the side of the flat and stand at his bedroom window with his window open. And I'd be sort of leaning in, playing the game. You are joking. You had the weirdest I've ever heard. The things you were willing to do. It's the strangest. What is this town like? No, stop going. Was there always music going? There's the horse in the house there. Oh, look at these two kids with big heads and webbed feet. All right, all right, Ronnie? All right, Reggie? What? What was it like? She was. She was. It's like you've grown up in a cartoon made for children. Yeah, yeah. No, his man was really obsessed with cleaning. I. When can I play through his window? Can I play through Mark's window? All right, you know what? You have to do she used to be up till that pillockton again. Washed your hands. Well, till 3 in the morning. Washing. Used to be up doing the tiles in the kitchen, washing until three in the morning. Three in the morning. And for ages and ages, I. That's what that saying that out on the tiles. I used to think that came from like his mum, because she was out, like cleaning them late. So until I was about 13, I thought that saying out late on the tiles. Yeah. Was. And now you're not confused by anything. Well, there's no misunderstandings in your life now, is there? So what did. Was he was allowed to walk in and out of the house, was he? He was all right, but. And he used to come around to ours a lot. I mean, mom used to get these pies from Agenbach's, right. So I don't know what that is. It's at that bakery where they used to chop the cakes out the back I told you about. Yeah. Oh, and you ate six. You had six. He loved it. But I could never go around to theirs. Or if I did, it was like, well, yeah, he is in. And I go, all right. And then I'd walk around the side of the flat, stand outside. Why did you ever knock at the door? Why just go around and knock on the window? Just check his in. Because he wasn't always in his room. He'd have to go to his bedroom. And this is the strangest. And you'd play a computer game through the window. You say it was a flat, it wasn't like a fifth story one. And you had to get in one of those kind of cleaning contraptions and like winch your way up. I love the idea of that. Oh, pillockton. So we're done, right? Have you got me any chimpanzee that? I've got Monkey News. Still. Still to cram in the next. Let's do Monkey News now. I need some Monkey News. I think we've done enough here, right? What do you mean, I think we've done enough here? We'll play a little song, eh? What? Play. Play the Verve. All right. Go on. He's getting all stressed cuz I screamed. Sparky Stream to Franklin. I'll tell you, I'm sick of the screaming, Rick. I'm sick of that. I mean, no wonder Carl hates you. And that is the word I don't use often, but he does. And I screamed to you in the past and he loathes you. Monkey News. Give us one of the screams so the audience gets a taste of it. I'm taking my headphones off. No, I'm not gonna scream. Come on, let's see what. Let's. Ah. Right. I don't know what you were doing. Was it worse than that? Yes. Right, come on. Monkey News. It's not called Monkey News. Chimpanzee. We're not gonna pack all the monkey stuff in. We've got quarter of an hour. What other show can say that? We're not gonna pack in all the monkey News. We've got 15 minutes. But we can't get all the monkey information. Right, go on, you're gonna love this one. Go on, let's have the jingle. Oh, chimpanzee. That. Right, I don't know how recent this was. Oh, God, 17th century. But it happened in acne, right? If you're outside London, that's in place in London and it's this monkey that's going about acne nicking DVDs. Even the monkey didn't go for video. Even the monkey knew. Well, there's no point in getting on vhs. The grudge. You're on vhs. Throw it back. Right, and there's a girl called Lisa who works in our office here, right? And I mentioned it to her because she lives in Hackney. I said, you familiar with this? And she said, oh, I remember something about it which annoyed me. The fact that a monkey's running riot. But she couldn't. She didn't know the full story and she lives there. What do you mean a monkey? Do you mean it? Do you mean a chimpanzee or a monkey? I don't know. Is he a zoo in Hackney? Is he a zoo there? I don't know. What. So it was. But it was like, is there a zoo in Hackney? I don't know. I don't know. That's what I was asking. So get on with the story. So anyway, so, yeah, it's been robbing stuff. And the other bit that really puzzled me, right, is the fact that. And you're not easily puzzled by monkey news. They took fingerprints. What do you think about that? Well, they took fingerprints, presumably because they didn't know it was a monkey to start with. No, they did. They saw it. They saw it nicking stuff and they said, get fingerprints. So that means there's more than just one doing it. I'm gonna have a heart attack. He had to fax them to Interpol. Yeah, yeah, we know that is. Yeah, it's bright. It's Brian the Monkey. Yeah, yeah, Sorry, I don't. He was stealing DVD. Specifically. DVDs DVDs, I think it said. Watches and stuff. What, breaking into homes? Yeah. In Hackney, maybe. Are you sure it wasn't a kid with a mask on? No. Seriously, how is he breaking into homes? They're good at the drain pipe. They're good and they. They're good, aren't they? But why would they do that? So is that the news? Well, that's. What? How much do you want. Is that. Monkey news for this week? Well, I don't know that it's true. Again, I've got. There was other stuff. There was another story that I found about a monkey, but I would like to know from someone in Hackney, if you know what I mean. And I missed that one on Crime Watch, which would have been good. Right. But there was another story about one that kept getting on buses, not paying its fare, not paying its fair and just sat in a corner reading the paper. Reading the paper? Carl, you're an idiot. That wasn't in love. You're an idiot. It wouldn't read the paper. Why would it read the paper? Because it was its way of sort of going, oh, well, if I'm reading something, maybe the inspector. The inspector will notice my hairy hands. Oh, Carl, you're such a fool. Well, I've just had a news flash that an infinite number of monkeys in Hackney and icking an infinite number of typewriters. Yeah, we don't know what for at this stage. We've got no more information and they've. Taken back an infinite amount of Graduate on video. So this is rubbish. Super glass. Seeing the light. I just think of people sort of other Saturday going, you coming shop? I can't, I'm listening to xfm, there might be some monkey news. And they waited two hours for that. What sort of a show has a feature called Monkey News? Well, I have to say the monkey story has been corroborated. Someone. Which one? Well, this one says, police in Britain this week are on the lookout for a very different kind of burglar, a chimpanzee who has been sighted breaking into a house in Hackney, stealing a mobile phone and leaving. The chimp is also the prime suspect in a break and entry in a nearby house where part of a radio was taken. One policeman stated that it might have been trained to steal. But a monkey's not going to think that's a mobile phone. I'll just have that look at Carl's face. Yep, fact. That's fact. So Rockbusters then. Get these out the way. We run out of time now. I have to say now that we've had no answers that have attempted even to guess all three. Right, you see. Now, see, that's because you're an idiot. Right. Okay. Right. Do. Do the question. Do the questions and the answers. And if. If. If I think that it's either too hard or ungettable because it's stupid. We've been in it. Right. I thought we'd already been. I'm annoyed, but. Right. Come on. Do what? Was to do it quickly. The first one was. Well, if he would have been wearing an helmet, he would have been. All right, well, what's the answer? That was B. What's the answer? Busted. Right, that works. That's fair enough. Did anyone get that? I assume some people got. No. People have given up, Rick. People aren't even bothering to contribute. Right, what's the next one? They've just ignored it like it never happened. Second Bastard. Why are them Jamaican men swinging fish around their head? Go on. That was D.S. Yeah. 70S band, Detroit Spinners. The Detroit Spinners have become the Detroit Spinners. Yeah. Okay. Brilliant. And then the final bit. I play you some effects. It's terrifying. Carl, what's happened there? What? What was happening? No, no, no. What's the answer? That was born Slippy. The woman was having a baby. The doctor tried to grab it. It fell onto the floor. That's in your head, Carl. That's just a load of screams. That's in your head. Oh. I'm. Do you know what? I haven't even got onto one. Slippy. I'm still on Did. Trout Spinners. Well, let's put a song. That's it. I don't. I don't know what to say. Song for the. A song for the ladies, surely. Does anyone get any of those? Let's end with Nick Drake and the Beautiful Riverman and we'll see you next week. And hopefully ditched Detroit Spinners. Well, don't keep saying it.",
