  "text": "Oh, proper rock band. Best band since Thin Lizzy, the Darkness, Big Words growing on me. Xfm 104.9 Bit rash, I think. Rjave's S merchant, K Pilkington with a little bit of. I know you're. I know for a fact that Steve is getting a little bit sick of Carl's attitude. Oh, thank you to Paul. I quite like it though because it's a straightaway friction and he's sort of like, you know, to be fair, I. Genuinely don't think I'm the culprit in this. I think I come in and I just ask him a simple request and immediately on my back, whinging, moaning, whining. I mean, I don't know if there's any evidence. Well, it's funny to say that actually, because Support. Anyway, yeah, it came up this week. It's quite extensive. Mancunians take more sick days than anyone else. Mancunians take more sick days than workers in any other city in Britain and Ireland, according to Manchester based employment firm. Survey by Peninsula found employees in Manchester take 11. Six days per year, whereas closest rivals Edinburgh and Dublin take an average of 9. Liverpool, Newcastle, Birmingham, Cardiff. Only 8. Is reading mentioned there? No, it's not even in it. It's not even in there. They don't take days off. London is only 7. So the point is, I mean, I don't think you can take anything from it, but if you're an employer and you had a Mancunian and a Liverpudlian, they were equal on everything else but you really couldn't afford them to be away. The pudding's gonna probably be away for eight days. Sure. The Manx gonna be away for 11. Phoning in sick and so what can. You, I mean, just analyzing the data though, what would you extrapolate from that? I. I really don't know. I mean, call if you've got any clues or email us in if you got any. I don't know why they. I, I think maybe. I don't know, man. I don't really know many people from Manchester. Well, I know one, but I know he was off sick because he put on wet trousers and he got a. He got cold, I think. Yeah, what he just said he was. He didn't come in for. He left early as well once. Yeah, but, but I don't know. I mean that's the survey. I don't know. I mean it's evidence because it's statistic. So there you go, guaranteed evidence. So any, any thoughts on that? Ricky Gervais fm.co.uk I mean, you're from. Oddly enough, you're from Manchester. I am, yeah. What are your thoughts on. On that? On what? Sorry? No, on the swivel. Oh, wasn't really listening. Sure. What? Man unions take off more sick days. They call in sick. I mean, presumably spuriously. Yeah. I mean, because they've got the same body, they're logically the same, so obviously making out their life some of the days. Maybe there's the 3 extra they're making up. Yeah. They're moaning, probably because we work a. Lot harder than the others, so we're tired. So you're sick, so you need time off. Probably. I mean, the Scousers, to be honest. Yeah. Take them on, let them work in your office. But you know how many computers are going to go missing? Right. That. So offensive is offensive. This is. This. No, this is a survey that proved. You just made that up. You just carried on the myth that Liverpool's thieves. Now, that. That is just. That's not true. That is not true. Well, it's not. Some of them do. There's been no survey that you're more likely to thieve if you're from Liverpool than if you're a Manchester. So that hasn't been proven yet. So all I've got is the evidence from a survey of, I think, three and a half thousand people. It's proof that people. Mancunians take off more sick days. XFM 104.9. This is April Come She Will by Simon and Garfunkel, Simon Agarth, Uncle. April Comes she Will. A lovely, lovely love song there. The X list was all about sort of like sexy songs because of the death of Barry White, of course, and Carl and Steve having a little argument. Steve said, well, there are such things as sexy songs, of course. Carl said, I can't understand it. Not understand it. How can something be sexy? How can you war one with a song? Steve went, well, you don't warn with it, you just put it on the background. Carl said, stick the telly on. Stick the telly on. I love that. You don't believe there's any such thing as a sexy song, is that right? I. I don't think it can get you in the mood. You know what I mean? Right. You're either in with a chance or you're not. I don't think it matters what. What song you put on. Well, I don't think it ups your chances. I don't think it does. If you put Channel 5 on. On a Friday night. Right. See, a little bit of that action gets anyone going, it's worth. For me. And that's all. What's that? When Pets Go Mad? No, you know, like. Well, I know the titles, haven't. I don't look at the titles, but. Let'S show with Chris Moyles. Do you mean the kind of erotic thrillers? Yeah, put one of them on. That's. That gets you going a bit tired and that. But what does the woman go, go, oh, that's an idea. Hey, that's an idea. They're normally. They're normally called something like illegal briefs, you know, they're normally about some kind of female solicitor who's defending a guy who may or may not be a killer, but maybe in a former life they were lovers. It's always some nonsense like that and presumably there's normally some gruesome murders. So how is that getting you in the mood? It's plot development. Yes, the narrative. Yeah. I'll tell you what, that's a lovely twist. I've got the awning. Yeah, brilliant. So if you're from Manchester. Sorry about that. I mean, it is true, we aren't. We're making that up. We weren't doing a stupid stereotype like Kyle did with Liverpool. It's just a survey that. Can you just take off more sick days. But they might be genuine. They might be sort of an iller people. Or it might just be people doing in Manchester go, can't be bothered to go to work. It's rubbish. Whereas if you're in London, you go, I can't wait to go to work. What a lovely place. This is some great jobs. Don't you. Great job, Daniel. Rick. I know you're always looking just to keep your kick abreast of, you know, new developments, what's happening. Yeah. I don't know if you've got any plans this evening, but you might want to pop along to the Hope and Anchor in Islington. Why? We're playing tonight. Restless Diesel. Please welcome to the stage Restless Diesel. I mean, we've talked about it before, band names where you just have to imagine you're supporting U2, Wembley Stadium. It can never happen. Please welcome to the stage Restaurant Dies, the first song. He goes. Thanks. Because. Great band before us. Restless Diesel. Yeah, A lot more of them. Yeah. It won't happen, will it? Sure. They're a great band, I think. What's the tax on that fiver in. Is it. It's not. Not telling us, actually, but yeah, to pop down the Hoban Anchor, maybe Tell us how restless Diesel were tonight. Yeah, just maybe call in on Christian show Monday. Just tell us how restless Diesel were. We can make that regular feature now. What's coming up on today's show? Well, listen, we got all the usual favorites we got and some new ones. We got monkey news that sorted. Carl told me people are guaranteed monkey. He called in, he said, I've got some monkey news. He's done that. I had to make sure we got that. We've got some great tunes. I've got a great song from Tupac, some Cat Stevens, some Jimmy Webb, some Thin Lizzie. Can I surprise you with something from Aerosmith? Brilliant treat from Evan Daniel. We're quite rocky today, aren't we? There's. There's a threat. There won't be Rockbusters. Good. That's no threat. But we can bring back Educating Ricky. I mean, because it's sort of like seasonal, isn't it, our show? We don't. It's not like Ant and Dex takeaways on all through the year. They go away for a few weeks and we get something else like Ian Wright's, you know, friends like these or something, you know, I mean, and so maybe Rockbusters, maybe not Rockbusters on hiatus. But Educating Ricky, always. And I'll tell you what, Jane's Addiction. Just because they rock as well, don't they? XFM 104.9. Excellent. Ricky Javic. Jane's Addiction. Just because on XFM 104.9, broadcasting from London, where people prefer to only be off sick when they actually are ill. You know, I don't think I've ever taken a day off sick, except when I had that terrible, terrible, terrible tonsillitis. Is that when you went home, stayed with your mum and dad? Yeah. Why is that a problem? They're a fat health. No, I'm not saying it's a Ross Mancha. Yeah. Got loving family. So sue me. What do you make of the antagonism and piss taking? It's just like, oh, God, three blokes in a pub, there's people listening. I can't. Are there, Carl, what do you make of London? Because you often say you'd much rather be up north. Well, he wouldn't. Or he'd go, well, this is why. You know, he constantly says, you've chosen. To live here, you've lived it for years, you've got a flat here. No, I chose to come here because I was offered a job. That was good money. Yeah. I wouldn't have come here if there was no Job. So you prefer to be somewhere where there's a good job. So you've chosen to live here. I don't like being here though. What? No, but you can leave. To what? Well, exactly. So you've chosen to stay somewhere that's better for you. It's not better for me, it's making me ill. I'm not sleeping well. So you say you're ill whether you call in here, but I don't think you are. But I mean, are there any stats to prove that? Well, yeah, because, you know, of the 11 days that he calls in sick, I reckon probably seven of them are genuine. If I drop down dead tonight, honestly, I'd love it. If you drop down dead tonight. You love it. Why are you sleeping? What? You're feeling ill now, are you? That's funny, you weren't feeling earlier but you read that and you're suddenly ill. I'm run down. Well, you should take holiday. Oh yeah, you just had about eight in the last six months. Oh God, why are you run down? Yeah, what have you done? You sit in a little air conditioned. Office, I haven't got time to tell you, let's move on, let's get on with stuff. What have we got anyway? Because we, we didn't have a chance to meet up this week. Me and Ricky could have done. But you said you were busy, Steve, so that's probably why you don't get run down. But finishing work about 4:00. No. So I could have had the meeting, but we gave you a time where you suddenly decided with very little notice that you couldn't make it. So. So what have we got then? What have we got? It's 20 past 1. What have we got? We're on till 3. Well, we've been talking, we've been doing well. We've been playing some great rock and roll, we've been playing some lovely songs. We've told them, we explained a survey just for employees. Be careful. We've, you know, put that out there, we put a shout out there. People know. Would you say it was probably safest if you are an employer to never employ Mancunians? Well, I wouldn't go that far. I wouldn't go that far because, you see, that's only an average. So I imagine some Moncunians, like, you know, Londoners, you know, are nice, reliable people. It's probably just a few bad eggs that throw the stats up a little bit. You know, people that would go, I'm not coming in today, I put on some wet Trousers. All right, stay in bed. Stay in bed. You still got them on? Yeah. Well, pop them off, put them on the radiator and go to bed with a little duvet. That'd be the best thing to do. Yeah, yeah. So, all right, Carl? What? What's your attitude? Is it because you're tired? Yeah. Well, why are you tired, though? You were saying that watching those Channel 5 films again. I'll tell you what we were. Me and Steve were having a little meeting yesterday or lunch about, you know, planning stuff for the show, and Gary Kemp came up to me, sat on a little chat about old times, and I went, oh, yeah. As he went away, Steve said, right, think of this. He said, rick, don't take this the wrong way. Remember that sentence? Don't take this the wrong way. So there's a right way and a wrong way. I could have taken this comment. He went. Nodded to sort of Gary Kemp and went, he's aged better than you. I went, well, how could I take that the wrong way? Yeah. Offensive. No. Well, the point is this. He. He does. He didn't know me 20 years ago. So he's actually saying, rick, don't take this the wrong way. He looks better than you do. Yeah, well, he does. But why say that, Carl? What? Did you really say that? Yeah. Although, can I just get. Just backtracking for a second? I love the fact you said you bumped into Gary Camp and you reminisced about old times. What old times did you share with. He came up and said, did we drop the pops together? I went, no, I did Razzmatazz. Oh, we did Razzmataz. I think he was thinking, had he ever met me before? But he hadn't. Because we hadn't. That's what I meant. Yeah. Yeah. And. But if you had to make an objective analysis, I wouldn't. I think that's out of order. Sure, sure. I mean, you're always slagging me off, but apparently you can't do it, make a value judgment on something else. No. Well, because you're, you know, you're morally all over the place. You know. You know, you don't know where you're coming or going. You should hear what I say about you behind your back. So are you. Would you say you're better looking now than you were? Or then I'm. What? Would you say you're better looking now than you were, than I was? When? Well, like. Like, you know. Have you aged well? Yes. You've aged well. Yeah. I've kept my looks bit evan Dando, this would be lovely. Look for sunshine, Evan Dando on a track called All My Life. That's beautif. Yeah. I can't get enough of that. That's brilliant. Great stuff. Adverts. Radiohead, go to sleep. That's good, isn't it? On XFM 104.9. Brilliant. Great DJ in there. Well, I've heard it before. Good, isn't it? Yeah. No, it was good. It was very good. It was very good. I was watching cable tv. I do a lot of that. And there's an advert, I've noticed. It reminded me of the sort of adverts you should see when I was a kid. It's one of those attempts to kind of educate young people, but doing it. Yeah, yeah. It's on mtv, but it's one of those things where it's clearly been made by people who are in their mid-40s. Who have never been cool. Who have never been cool. Yeah. Who've been working really hard to get into TV all their lives and. And now are trying to appeal to, you know, funky and possibly wayward young people. And it's kind of nerdy. Wows. Yeah, exactly. And it's. It's a kind of stunning model and two of her stunning model friends, but they're just a couple of average girls, you know, going about their business. And, you know, it says something like, it's all shot very funkily, like a kind of, you know, lock, stock and two smoking barrels kind of thing. And she's just grooving along with her friends and it's kind of like the captions are things like, you know, Isabella, 17, she's cool, she's quite funky. She's got these great friends and they're sort of hanging out laughing, and she just pops into a tattoo parlor. Her friends are like, what are you doing? But she just goes in, you know, she has a tattoo done. It sort of says she's wild, she's crazy. You know, she lives life as she sees it. She takes every day as it comes. She's not tied down to anything. She doesn't smoke cigarettes. Yeah. If you think all this is cool, then. Then you probably won't want to sink cigarettes if you want to be cool. Yeah. Like Isabella or whatever. The thing with that is that people watching that, the. The. The youth watching that will go, well, Bill at my school, he's. He smokes and he's cool. Exactly. Yeah. This is the problem with it. Yeah. It's not that the impulse is wrong. The message is fine. It's just this thing. I don't. I can't imagine those things ever working with you, with young people, with yous. It's like when you see. When you know, what was it, what. It will is you'll get a lot of 13 or 14 year olds sneaking out and getting a tattoo. Exactly. So the parents be going, I'd rather she smiles. She might give that up sometimes. She's got a spider's web on her face now for the rest of her life. Exactly. Yeah. But it's sort of. It's like. You remember that thing when they tried to get young people to vote? Remember that? Was it Rock the Vote? Was it. Was it people like Billy Bragg and people kind of. Yeah, I just. I. I don't know who that appeals to. I don't know. You know, some youth, he's kind of smashing up a bus shelter, throwing bricks at old people. I just can't. I don't believe it ever. I think it was Mick Hucknell was another one. What's that, Mick? Oh, dear. I remember the ones where he just. If. If you're. If you're gonna go off with a stranger, your cat went, well, don't. Yeah, ask Mummy first. Yeah. And I remember I was trying to jump in cars left, right and center, but my cat, when I was like five or six, would go. And I go, good point. Yeah, you're right. He could be a nutter. But I seem to remember the. The Charlie's. The Charlie says it was. Charlie says. Charlie says, I always find them really unnerving. He lived in that very eerie kind of world where you never really saw anyone. Yeah, but it was very kind of. It was very eerie. It wasn't very kind of comfortable. I hadn't spent a lot of money on the cartoon, but it was. I always got the sense with him that he was probably really quite lonely. But I like the fact is that. He had a cat. Please. But by the time I came out, they'd gone off and I missed the picnic. But Mummy was so pleased that I'd asked her, she gave me an apple. No, I think Charlie got something he liked. He gets a fish. Yeah, right. I was thinking an apple. No, I seem to remember it being. That I'm getting apple anyway. Give me some sweets. Yeah. Or a tattoo. I always thought there was a con when your parents got you some clothes you needed for Christmas. Yeah. I'm not falling for that. I go, look, I'm getting the clothes anyway. I want battling tops. But the Charlie says, I seem to remember when when they were. They asked him to go off for the picnic. By the time he'd asked Mum, because she was on the phone, I don't know if she was chatting to the middle of the day. Yeah, the kids are gone and I. Seem to remember her clients. Exactly. I seem to remember. I seem to remember that he said, don't worry, he was fine because Mum took him and Charlie on a picnic. Not as good. Who would rather go with your mates or with your mom and your cat? Yeah. I mean, yeah, I think. I think they were friends. This Scotch egg, sinks of fish. Well, I had to bring it for Charlie. Don't bring raw fish in the picnic basket. I think is those. They weren't friends with us, they were just local kids. You go, let's go. Let's go and ask that weirdo with the cat who wants to come down the bar. Let's go. Ask the weirdo who thinks the cat can talk and then run away. When he goes to ask his mom. When he goes off to ask his mum, they're just going, ask your mom. Yeah. Hello. Hiya. All right? We're the local lads. The cool local lads. We smoke, we got tattoos. Do you want to come and play with some puppies in the disused mine? Ask your mum first. Quick run. He's talking to the cat. Look, he's talking to the cat. They were just around the corner spying on him. They were just laughing. There was no picnic. Did you ever go on a picnic, Carl? Was there places to go in Manchester? Was it like Quarryland? Mostly. The problem with those, those adverts, like, when I was growing up, it sort of give you ideas because remember the. Charlie's one, right, and we were on holiday, right, And I met these two lads who. Knocking about with, like, mates and that. And that advert came on and we thought it'd be a good idea to wind his mam up because this advert had just been on saying, you know, kids are going missing in Wales, right? Yeah. So we said, oh, this will be a good laugh. We put the kid in the wardrobe. His mum came back from shopping. We said, oh, he's gone missing. We haven't seen him for hours. That's terrifying. I know, that's cool. About 13. And what was his motion? Must have been. Yeah, she was going mad. And that's when we thought, oh, God, we've. We've gone. Will we say anything? Will we pretend we don't know where he is? Open the wardrobe. He'd suffocated. Yeah. That's horrible. Carl. I know, but it's just what you do. Well, no, you do. What do you mean, it's just what you do. What was it? Was he in the wardrobe? Was he listening to this? Why didn't he go, mum, it's all right. When, dear, they're crying? No, she wasn't crying. She was just panicking and like, screaming a little bit and that. Screaming a little bit. Okay, we tell her when the screaming starts. Exactly, yeah. And then what's the other thing like on the same. Like, you know, all this was going on when I was growing up, and one time we're on holiday and my mom said, right, if you're going on the beach, it's a big beach, but, you know, if you're gonna go out and play there, I need to know where you are. So wear these bells. Where? This cow bel, she gave me a balloon. A balloon. And it just, you know, sort of attached to me arm. So wherever I was playing in the sea and that, you can see the balloon and that. But then the problem was everyone else thought, that's a good idea. And it was just like loads of kids with balloons and that. Oh, I ruined it. So that. That didn't work. Yeah, that's a been that idea. Weren't you in a car park once? Oh, no, it was New Year and we were all gathering up, you know, like in Trafalgar Square at New Year, everyone gathers and they have a big kind of party and stuff. Well, in Bristol, they do something very similar on a smaller scale. And I was there one New Year with my friends, and for some reason I picked up a balloon during the evening. You know, I don't know where I got it from, but I was holding this balloon and these girls came up to me and I thought, yeah, nice, nice, you know, maybe a little New Year kiss. They come up, they said, hey, are you going to be here for. For a while? And I said, well, yeah, yeah, I probably will. They said, it's just that we've arranged to meet back at you at midnight. What do you mean? Because I was so tall, I had a balloon, I was towering above everyone else. They said. I said. I said what? I said, we're going to meet back at you at midnight. They said, don't worry, you can go about your business because we can see you wherever you are. This is where Nelson's column is? No, no, no, this is in Bristol. Oh, right. Okay. And. And so I'm sort of wandering around, and then at midnight, they, they. These two girls turned up again and Some of these lads come and meet them and they're sort of laughing and joking. I'm thinking, oh, I'm probably gonna invite you back to a party. I watched them get in a cab, they went off, they had a wild night. Then I did have a balloon, so it was a great new year for me. Oh, should we have a little bit of Tupac? Yeah, if you want. Yeah. There's a great lyric in this. It's picture me rolling, right? But at the end, he's saying about me. Now I've. I'm, you know, drinking Remy, and I'm in a Rolls Royce. He goes, oh, yeah, I forgot the da. Can she see me from here? Can you see me, ho? And I think, this is like district attorney. Turn on the radio. And two back around going, could that ho see me? She's going, yeah, yeah, I can see you. Yeah, it's brilliant. Two pack. I'll tell you what, we should get Rolling Rockbusters. No, no. Well, he has done it. He just said that he was worried about it because we said it's the last one. What do you think, Carl? Just don't think. I mean, can I just say. Now, Carl, seriously, I'm only responding to what we're getting on the email, which is people do not want Rockbusters. They really. There's one guy here who is. He says, Ms. James Pooley. He says he's preempted Carl by giving my answers to this week's quiz. I don't know what the clue would be, but his answer is no Van Ear Nirvana. Yeah, good. No Van here. Yeah, that'll be. Sounds like one. Number two. He's just guessed. He's probably not getting what the clue would be, but the answer is Kid Creosote. Yeah, that's good. That's. That is brilliant. That's a better game. And the last one is Hairy Seacomb. Yeah, yeah, that'd be good. So, I mean, maybe we should reverse it so people just, you know, we. Have to come up with a clue for them and we win the prizes. Yeah. Did you even. Have you got prizes ready as well? So label. Oh, I feel sorry for him now. We. What the prizes would have been. I'd rather just give them away to the first person to email him. Look at Carl's face. I wish. Oh, can't we get this on telly just for Carl's face? Which. What? Hey, I'll tell you what we could do, Steve, you know, like Smiley Miley and that used to take the Radio. 1 roadshow out oh, man, that would be amazing. Come on. Should we take it out? Hello, Bournemouth. Yeah. How many miles have I done? Don't care. Should we do this? How many miles we done? Well, xfms down the road. One. Yeah. Should we take it out the road? Just so they can see. Carl, to be fair, though, I mean, you're not really keen to leave W1, are you? I would. We wouldn't. Right, so where. Where exactly would we take the roadshow? We'd do it outside. Outside the building? Yeah. Right. Okay. And what would you do? It's called a roadshow because it's in the road and I imagine, isn't it? And we'd give away T shirts. Throw away throwing T shirts. And then we'd have a band. We'd have. Well, we'd have band playing. What was that band playing tonight? I forget something. Diesel, was it? Yeah, See, Instantly forgettable. I mean, that was my point, really. We could have them on. Yeah. Great. Yeah. Get a couple of celebrity pals down. Someone from Big Brother 2. That would be ideal. Josh. That the other little gay fella? Yeah. He'd. Come on, just wave. Yeah. I'm beginning to like the idea. Yeah, Brilliant. Yeah. So we'll have Josh something. Diesel. We're playing the Bull and Gates now, whatever it is. Right. I'll throw out some T shirts. Yeah. And then, Carl, Carla, do a live Rockbusters. Yeah. Well, I don't know. Do you want it? I just think that ruins it slightly. It would just bring the whole afternoon down. Rick. I think we get it sponsored by someone. Yeah. No, well, I'm just trying to read the prices, what they would have done. There's a PlayStation game here. I guess it's maybe not been released yet. It's a little demo of that. What's this? The American Song Poem Anthology. I don't exactly know what that is again, but lots of songs on there and a couple of compilations. Arbitrary compilations. The Club Anthems compilation. The best summer holiday album ever. Well, you've certainly sold it to me, Steve. The best air guitar album again. Brilliant. And an old edition of Only Fools and Horses. So you really haven't put the effort into the prizes, Carl. So if that's the prizes, if that's the whole point of the competition, and they're the best prizes you could conjure up. In God's name, how bad are the clues this week? That's why he doesn't want you to do it, Carl. We won't bother. We got it. Doesn't matter. Good. Excellent. Well, that's resolved. Brilliant. That's excellent. What we have got, though, is Educating Ricky, haven't we? Well, another one of my little things. Oh, it's brilliant, then. So how long is this gonna last before you want to get ditched? This? Well, we'll see. A couple of weeks. Not like that, Carl. It's all one. It's all. We're. It's one love, man. We're on the same team. Yeah, we're just one voice man. One true voice. Like those. Like those lads. Yeah, they could play. All right, well, the Educating record. Why don't we play a record and come back with Educating the Win Cat Steven, we need to get the jingle queued as well. Yeah, I'll get the jingle queued up. I haven't got Neil Young lined up yet. No, not. Here we are, Cat Stevens. I've gave it to you. We're not playing that yet. Can we just play record? Well, I told you to see. What? What? So why aren't you playing the record I told you to play? Because we've just had something chilled right, from Tupac. Let's lift it up a bit now with a little bit of Blur. All right, Come on, play. Oh, how much you. I just have Crazy beat. Throw on XFM 104.9. Right, we're gonna do Educating Ricky instead of Rockbusters. Incidentally, on the subject of Rockbusters, we're just an email from Phil. He says I could do with this week's rather shoddy array of prizes as I'm doing a car boot sale tomorrow and need a bit more tat to fill the table. We might as well do it anyway. But Educating Ricky, it was a feature. Well, actually, about a year ago, I started a feature called Educating Carl because we found out he had one E at O level at history, and I'd educate him on things like Rasputin, things I thought he'd be interested in, you know, Winston Churchill, some of the great. Some scientific facts. And then I said, it's your turn. And he started telling me about people born without legs. Some people have got a funny eye. There's a woman whose tongue's longer than her arm and really, you know, turning the screw on education. So I don't know what he's got for me today. Maybe a dog. Born a cat. Let's have a look. We've done that one. We've done that often. We should point out there's sometimes a crossover between Educating Ricky and Cheeky Freak of the Week, just in terms of subject matter. Yeah. So We've done Cheeky Freak of the Week. We've done all the freaks. What we done with the freak week. There's a. What was a dog? There was a woman that had the back legs of a dog. There was. Last week. There was. What was last week? It was the. It was the. It was the girl who was born with four eyes, two males and three legs. Sure you weren't that impressed. I thought, if we've got to that and it's not impressing you. We are. A tough audience in it. Let's move on. Is there a jingle for Educating Ricky? Educating Ricky? Oh. Oh, God. Oh. Oh, you've told me. Educating Ricky. Very similar to some of the other jingles I've done. Well, they're made by the same people. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just. I mean, Educating Ricky is just stuff that I learn in the week and I think that's interesting. I keep it up here and then I share it with you. Right. And some interesting stuff. One of them. Right, Mount Everest. Go on, I need more. Right, well, there's a problem. Yeah. Because people are leaving rubbish up there and that. And like, people. Whoever owns it, you're saying, oh, he's saying, forget this, they're leaving a mess and all that. But do you know why it's called Mount Everest? Sorry, what was that? That's one, is it? That's one. There's rubbish on Mount Everest. How many people go up there? Are we talking about people dumping old tellies? Who's fed up the yeti? Well, I mean, what are you talking about? No, I mean that. That isn't what I'm educating you. I'm just telling. This is part of the story. I'm just telling you. Just a bit of context for you. They're leaving loads of rubbish up there. Well, they're not eating loads of rubbish out there, are they? No, they are. They're like crams and washing machines and seagulls flying everywhere. I don't. Anyway. But anyway, do you know why it's called that? You know it's called Mount Everest. Why it's called Mount Everest? I know the mount bit. It's because it's a large mount and if you climb it, by the time you get to the top, you need to have a rest. And that is. That isn't the educating bit. I'm just telling it's not true. Well, we'll. We'll leave that. Well, no, Carl, in the name of everything holy, do you think that anyone named it because you have to have a rest when you've climbed it. Well, we'll see. You'll see what people say on email. But it's definitely not. But anyway, that's one thing that I kind of thought that's interesting. I'll remember that. I'll teach Ricky that. So you've learned that, right? Now are you familiar with this thing that they can do if you're dead, right? No, no, not if you're dead. It's like if you're ill and you know you're gonna die, right. I don't know what this is anymore. Extraordinary. Have a rest. Imma. Liars. Im a liar. What? What? What? Listen, this is an interesting fact. Come on. If so if you're ill but you know you're gonna die. Yeah. You can have this thing done in Detroit where you get put in a fridge, right. And if they work out, you know, what's wrong with you, in 20 years time, you go, right, that fellow is in the fridge. He had that. We can sort it. Let's get him out and sort you out. Yeah. Is this the first time you've come across this idea? Yeah, I read it the other day. I didn't know about it. I've never heard of this before. Sounds quite preserved. It's good, innit? They take you, they take, they make. They put you at sort of like sub zero temperatures so stop all cellular activity. So does. Do you stop aging at that point? Yeah, you suspended animation. So. Well, what's that? What's the law on it? Right? Because say if I say if I add something, right? Yeah. And I said, oh, put me in a fridge. And when, when you've got the cure and that wheel me out and sort me out. Safety did that and it was like 40 years. Yeah. And in 40 years time they get a cure for me. Yeah. Would. Would I have to stay with Suzanne because she'd be 70? Do you mean what are the rules? You can. Should you be allowed to date a younger woman? Well, it's not fair, is it? Good news. Good news. Sort you out. But I don't think she's mine. I reckon she's had the best 40 years of her life. Yeah. And plus they're never going to find a cure for what ails you. That is genius. That is brilliant. You come out, you're cured, you go on. I love the fact that's what he'd be lying there if you could think while he was in that state. You think, oh God, she's losing her looks. Yeah, just. Oh dear. But, but everything else as well, like My job wouldn't. Wouldn't be here. No, no. Although the figures would have gone up a little bit. Yeah. Flats probably gone or knocked down or whatever. Sure. Mostly. Family would be dead. Yep. So what's the point? How do you know about it? Who's done it? Well, famously, Walt Disney, apparently. I mean, Walt Disney actually did die, but had his body preserved so that should they one day be able to bring back people from the dead, they need. They need. But with him, nothing is going to change because when he comes out, Mickey Mouse will still look the same. Sure. And plug in all that. Play record. I don't know where your mind is. Play a record. It's brilliant. You just say words. It's the Everett 50 cent in the club on XFM 104.9. So Carl's a little bit fed up today, actually. Whinging, I mean, properly whinging. Fed up. Reckons he's tired. Reckons he's overworked here, but do you know what I mean, Carl? Everyone gets tired. Everyone gets tired. Everyone does the same sort of hours to you. What do you do? Sort of nine till six, seven? About nine till half seven, eight. Well, no, because I've. A couple of times this week, I've sort of met you for drink. About six, so it's funny, innit? Some of the times I've come back after it, just for another 40 minutes or something whilst no one's around, try and get stuff done without phones going, without emails coming in. Yeah. We gotta do it. Can I tell you what I think's a disappointment? You gotta do it. I just think it's a disappointment that Carl hasn't been able to put that aside and rise to the occasion. He's only got to do this show once a week. I know we're tired. You've got one job. We've got about six and we're still doing it. You know what I mean? We still do it. We still do it. You're a professional, Nick. I mean, that's why you've won multiple awards. It's because you're willing to get up there even if you're feeling a little bit underwater, even if you hurt yourself. You've got an injury of some kind. Yeah. You're doing it. Yeah. Entertaining. You're providing a service. Yeah. So it's disappointment. Yeah. But I've pressed all the right buttons at the right time. Indeed. Right. So I get paid for. Yeah, yeah, done that. The adverts have gone out. Sure. I mean, I've made you cups of tea. The negativity, which is a problem. It's the vibe. You're bringing us down and therefore the listeners. Therefore the listeners bringing us down. If you don't like London, you know what to do. Well, I'm trying. I'm trying to get out of here, aren't I? Try. We just bought a new flat. That's not. That's. That's not the best. Buy a flat in Manchester, live there, doesn't matter. I can always rent it out and make a little bit of money. Why don't you sell the flat in London and buy a street in Manchester? Pilkington Avenue? You can literally have the Lord, the king of that street, and people could come to you like Solomon with their problems. Yeah, well, he's come up from London. He's got London ways. Now, interestingly, have you heard you. Do you remember the famous King Solomon story that there are two women, they both are arguing over whose baby it is? And they present this to. They say, this is. This is my baby. No, this is my baby. He knows one of them's lying, but he doesn't know which one. And so. And so what does he do? How does he. How does King Solomon solve that? How does he figure out whose baby this is? They're both white fellas. Yeah. Both what? White. White fellas. Someone. Two women. Right. It's two white women to be probably. They probably weren't, you know, completely white. Yeah, whatever. Yeah, they're of the same. No, I'm just working out. Working out. Right, all right. Yeah, all right. And don't think about what King Solomon would necessarily. Yeah, it wasn't that. It wasn't. It wasn't that easy. No, it's not. There's not one tall, skinny white one with big ears, and so is the baby. The other one's a little short Chinese bloke. It's two women for a start. Yeah, two women. Okay. The baby to look at could be either. He doesn't know which, but he knows one of them's lying, obviously. And. And is the one line saying it's hers or saying it's not? Right. Okay, this isn't worth it, Steve. I'm going to tell you what he said, and you tell me if you think it was good or not. He says, then what we do is. As King said, what we do is, I'll take a sword, I'll cut the baby into two and you can have half each. And one of the women says, no, don't do that. And one of them says, yeah, that's fair. Right. You see, I said, which one was it? Sorry. Well, my guess is the one that didn't want it done probably was the mother of the child. The one that didn't mind having the baby cut in half probably wasn't a mother of the child. Why don't you think, you bald little mank twat, play a record? Well, I'm just. Although it's not a very good solution. No, that doesn't. The woman who was lying could have come up with something better than, yeah, cut it in half. What you should have done is. Yeah, they'll give it to the other one as well. Yeah. Jaded from Aerosmith on XFM 104.9. Just trying to pet things. You're up. You're up there. I mean, we've got lots of work to do. We're filming too, and we got loads of things added. Admin, DVDs, everything like that. We come in here. This is Proxy. This is. This is. This is not a drop in the ocean. The sort of work and money we earn. Right. Really, if we do this to keep charitable status because. And yet you. You know. Carl, come on. What's the matter with you? Are we doing Rockbusters? Come on, Rick. I'll tell you what. Because it's your special day and I want you to have a great time today. We're gonna do robust. If you cheer up. If you cheer up. Miserable. It just got ratty. Then don't push it on me. Air. Don't put it on me. What were you trying to put on my head? I was trying to put a pear on your head to knock it off with a ball like William Tao. But it was that your. Because your head is so round and the pear was round. I tried to flatten it a little bit and I didn't know it was a juicy pear, so I thought it'd be like just to crush it a little bit. And he went mano. Because he had juice rubbing running down his face. Why is it my fault the pears are faulty for pear. Exactly. Get proper fruit in here. It worked with the apple. That was fine. And then he gets ratty with me. Okay, let's not waste any time with Rockbusters. Can we really just whip through it? Just do the clues quickly. Quick. Go Rockbusters. Right, Go. Right. The first clue. Yeah. Hurry up. Faster. All the police cars are on fire. All the police cars are on fire. What's the initials? Bs. Bs. All the police cars are on fire. Good. What's the next one? The director of 28 Days later is shouting about sleeping outside. Yeah, okay. What's the initials for that? D.B. Right. Okay. Okay. Yeah, right. Go on, then. He wants to be a sailor. Why is that? Yeah, well, what's the initials there? Hey, brilliant. Okay, quickly, because I didn't quite catch the second one, so. But go from the top. All the police cars are on fire. Yeah, yeah. The director of 28 Days later is shouting about sleeping outside. Yeah, okay. DB yeah, right. He wants to be a sailor. Why is that? Yeah, B, B. Okay, then. Brilliant. Okay, now, Carl, you gonna cheer up now? Email only. Ricky geraysirgin.co.net Radio 1 Roadshow. Smiley Miley. Smiley Miley's mileage game, if anyone remembers that. I mean, here's a man, right, whose job. Smiley Miley was not a dj. Let me forget. Smiley Miley was the guy that organized the vans that carried the equipment to and from the roadshows because he was such a crazy personality, because he smiled a little bit. He got recognition cards, longevity, lots of money, and lives where he wants to live, the town that he wants to live in. Why don't you just enjoy the town that you've chosen to live in? Because it's so good. London. What towns have you been to? Have you. Have you traveled at all? I've been about a bit, yeah. Right. Okay, then. What towns did you like? Okay, forget Manchester with that safe. You like Manchester? Well, I'll do the big three. London, New York, Paris. Okay, you don't like London even though you live here? Got flats here. Good. Excellent. That makes sense. Have you been to New York? Yeah. What do you think? It's amazing city. I like it. It's. It's. It's just noisy. It's smelly. Well, it's the city that never sleeps. I'm not surprised, with all the. All the racket and that. Paris, the city of love. The most romantic city in the world. Not really. I remember seeing an old woman in McDonald's in there, and it put me off. That's where. Where that thing happened, where the old woman was. What's that tell us? We talked about it before. The old woman in McDonald's. Yeah. She was sat in the corner there with her legs open, no knickers on. All right. Oh, God. That's palace. Paris. Did that put you off your cheeseburger? Next city. Where have you been to? I don't know. Oh, the most beautiful city. Venice. Yeah, I've been there. Yeah, it's good. No. Why? Because they sell it. They sell it to you as if it Is a romantic city. Where did you see it sold? No, I saw. I saw it on when I was growing up. Right. Remember 321 with Ted Rogers? Yeah. One of the star prizes on there. Right. And they'd say, let's show you the video. Let's see what you're going to. Let's see where you're going to be loving it for a couple of weeks. And they'd show you this scene of, like the gondolas. Yeah. And all the city lit up at night. Yeah. Like a man and woman sat on a boat looking it and stuff. Yeah. I went there. Bin bags everywhere. Play a record. Play a record. Wish you were here with Carl Pilkins. 10. All right. It's London. Flooded. Black River Motorcycle club stop on xfm. Carl's back. He's cheering up a little bit because I think he's vented his spleen a little bit on cities around the world that aren't as good as Manchester. So is there any your family left in Manchester? Because they all moved away, didn't they? You came here. Your dad's moved to Wales, for Christ's sake. Well, your family are all around. The brother joined the army to get anywhere. Just take me anywhere. I don't know where he is. His sister's moved away, so. No. Yeah, there you go, you see. So that's just one family that's just. That's. That's one family who love Manchester. Exactly. All right. Tell you what, Steve, go on. I did find out in the week. Yeah. World record. Right. Person with the longest Trump. With the longest what? Wind fart. Right. Right. 2 minutes 42 is the world record. Okay, Right. Well, I'm immediately thinking about a relative of yours who I'm sure did longer than this. He still lives in Manchester. Auntie Nora. Now, anti. Nora did it, wasn't it? Starfighter for five minutes. But unfortunately, she was the only person in the room. Whereas, I think, which one's live, Ross or Norris McWhirter? I don't know. Actually. He has to be there. Yeah, I think he actually has to be there. He'd have to be there. Would you want to be there? Well, he'd have sort of equipment. Looking at his watch going, finished. He goes, yeah. He goes, well, that was four minutes. Did she go from like a size 10 to a size 6? Did she show some old dresses, like a hovercraft. Exactly. In a big dress, just slightly off. Yeah. So it has to be invigilated. But again, you know, how was the World Guinness Book of world records. One individual, I mean, who. Who was supervising that, he said, he. Said, I can fart for two minutes. They went, well, we've got to see this went round and he just probably let it rip. It's probably circular breathing. He's probably sort of sucking in air and swallowing it as he's going. And it's a continuous one, isn't it? It's not like. Yeah, you know, that's. That's how Nora's happened. Me Auntie Nora, she had a little bit of wind. It went on for like two and a half minutes. Sure. That's. That's when she called me mum, as. It was still going on, and said. There'S something not right here. I'm leaking. She. She said, oh, can you send your dad round? You know my dad? Yeah. Sent to me mum with a cork, with a lighter. This would be the best one. I want to show the kids something. He said, I'll be there in a bit. Get the windows open. Open. But what it was down to, because. I was talking to the split tennis ball. Yeah, I was. I was talking to Mum and Dad about it, saying, you know, why. Why do you think it happened? And that. And it's because she. She never chucks food away, right. And she'll sort of mash it all up. And she's got all these ice cream tubs in the fridge that are just full cabbage water, old mashed up food, really. And she prepares everything right. She doesn't work, she's retired now. She's got nothing to do all day. But everything's got to be ready. Do you know what I mean? Everything's got to be done. Even though if you're going around to her house and you're going there for tea, it's like, what time are you coming? And it's like, well, I don't know, maybe five, maybe six. Yeah, at five or six. You know what I mean? That's what. So. So when you say she mashes up food, she literally takes the remnants of a dinner, could be sort of some. Anything, and just smashes it all up into a. And then what does she do with it? Put it in the fridge. And she's got. In the fridge, it's like January, February, March. She's got all these ice cream boxes, not just full of. But she doesn't. She reheats it. Oh, then she. Yeah, she's keeping it. No, put it in a pan, warm it up. Oh, and that's. That's what it is. It's just a lot of vegetation. Is it? Yeah. Why does it only happen once? Or did she save it up once a year? Just let it go? I don't know. I don't know. But she is mad. She's. Yeah, she sounds potty. She doesn't answer the phone anymore in case there's a burglar checking if she's in. That's like. We'll answer it and then they'll know you are in and they won't come out. Mental. They can't be sure then, can they? What do you mean? Well, if there's no. Well, maybe it's someone just they are in but they're hiding. Whereas if Auntie Nora goes, it's Honey Nora. We can. Nick, she'll be farting. We can sneak in. When she does a loud one, we'll be aware of telly. What's stopping it? It's got a valance round it. It's got caught on the cat. So have we got a recap on Rockbusters? Has anyone got the right answers? Has anyone got the right answers? Let me just check here. Here's one from someone who just says he's given an answer. Answer to number one. I number two, don't number three care. Right, okay. Is he close? Has anyone got three answers? I can't find one with three answers. So again, you've done something wrong, Carl. No, no. This isn't radio. This isn't radio. Play a record. There you go. Someone's got it. Give it to them. Fine. Okay. Give us the clues again. We'll give the answer straight away. No Funny in the rain. Yeah. Pointless. Number one, all the police cars are on fire. Yes. Bs. Yeah. What was that? I can think of something. Go on. Blazing squad. Brilliant. The director of 28 Days later is shouting about sleeping outside. Yeah, that's Dan Yell, bed in field. Right. Danielle. Danielle. We're never in filled. Right. We never let him do this again. I told you, I washed my hands of it. I know, but I thought. Because he was grumpy, but this is what happens. Look what's happened. Danielle Bedingfield. That's what happened. The director of so. So Danny Boy. So Dan. Right, all that for Dan, but shouting about being Daniel bed in the field. Right. What's the last one? He wants to be a sailor. Why is that? Yeah, Beyonce. What does that mean? Beyonce. He wants to be on the sea Play record. You're never doing it again. You just signed your death warrant. You're never doing Rockbusters again. And if monkey news is about that, we ban that as well. And we're serious this time, so Joanne. Cutford stuff off to you. Doing the shout out. Well done. What have we done, Rick? What have we done? World party. Is it like today? Still to come, we've got monkey news. Is that right? Yeah, yeah, we're guaranteed monkey news. But I'll tell you what, I know I can look the look in your eyes. You know what, just play some Everett's. There's a little sailor fella, he wants to, you know, join the Navy. Why? Beyonce. Beyonce Knowles. Is this surname. Yeah, Midshipman Knowles. Now, Carl, we're going to do another edition, I think, of wish you were here, because that really cheered you up, didn't it, Tom? Where else you been? Where have you been? Have you been. You've been around Europe, haven't you? You've been to any hot country, You've been to Greece. Greece, Turkey, Gone. Turkey, yeah. Little fellas, little midgets working in the canteen in the hotel I was in. Okay. Aisling. Suzanne as well. Okay. Have you. Have you been to. Have you been to Scotland? Once for the. For the Edinburgh Festival. Gone, that's where. I looked out of my hotel room, saw a traffic warden putting a ticket on some bin bags. Brilliant. Has it gone into the road? So that's. That's Turkey, Scotland. What about places here? Has he been to the west country? Where we went to my neck of the woods. Bristol. I've been around. What else is around there? Bath. Been to Bath? Yeah. What do you make of it? Once you've been, probably don't need to go again. It's sort of old and they don't. They don't change anything. That'll be the Roman spa he's talking about, I think. What about Brighton? Gay people. Right, okay, thank you. Next week on Wish you were here, we'll go some other places where there are gay people. Fascinating. Brilliant. Another extraordinary insight there, Carl. Could we have some monkey news? Well, just before we do monkey news. All right. Can I do a little psychological test on you? On me? Yeah. Okay. It's brilliant there. Someone emailed it in. Brilliant. Right, Little story with a question at the end. Okay. Right, Right. This is gonna be so annoying. No, no, it's not, honestly. Well, it is, because you're gonna think it's science and it's going to be trite. All right, well, go on. Right, little. Little story first. Right, there's this. And this girl was at a funeral. Same funeral. Yeah. Right. It was a mother's funeral. Oh, yeah. She met this fella who she didn't know, right? But she thought this fellow she met was amazing. She didn't know him, right, but she thought he was brilliant, right? Like a dream fella, right? And she fell in love with him, right? But never asked for his. His number, his phone number, right? Right. And she couldn't find him. Now, a few days later, the girl killed her own sister, right? Yes. Question is, why did she do that? Okay, well, it's one of those stupid things then, isn't it? So it's not logic, it's. It's. It's. What am I thinking? No, no, it's not. Seriously, it's a proper. It's a mental test. It's a proper mental test. A mental test. It does. It is a bit mental. So. So you understand the story? I kind of. Let me just get it. Right. So there's a funeral. A girl goes to the funeral of her mother. Yeah? She. She meets the guy. Or she meets the. Meet again. The funeral. She meets the virgin. He looks alright. I fancy a bit of that. Right. Has a chat with him, yeah. But doesn't get his name, doesn't get a phone number. So, cut a long story short, the things are asked, right? So. So the reason she kills her own sister, is this something to do with finding out something about the man she met? Well, just answer the thing. Just. Why do you. Why? Okay, then, I'll answer it then. She went mental. She was a spy called Derek. What do you mean? Just answer it. Anyway, I'm testing Steve. Right, well, she killed her own sister because her sister had stolen some money from her and was sleeping with her husband. Is that. Is that. It's an answer. What's the answer on the paper? So, come on, what is. Well, the answer is no. An answer is that she was hoping. That the guy would appear at the funeral again. He'd go to the funeral, right? That's not a proper psychological test. It's one of those stupid little shitty things. It's like a man goes into a field and dies. Why? His parachute didn't open. That's what I'm thinking. I'm surprised you learn anything. Romeo and Juliet. Oh, Juliet's a fish. It said she was hoping that the guy would appear again at a funeral. If you answered this correctly, you think like a psychopath. This was a test by a famous fella, right, who used it on killers. And most of the killers got the answer right. Did you also think that. Was that the answer you gave when you first read? I didn't know. I didn't know, But I wondered what you would have got. Good. So that's it. That's the point. But it's a psychological test for looking at something very, very specific. What's up with that? Well, what was the best that could happen? That he'd got it right. So he is a psychopath. What annoys me is you're not happy with that test. But before you wasted three minutes trying to balance a pear on my head, what were you getting out of that? Let's play a song and have some money. Something. Joe Jackson. Is she really going out with him on xfm? Right. It's the time that most people, I imagine, have been waiting for. Monkey news. Play the jingle. Okay. Oh, chimpanzee that monkey news. All right. Come on, come on. Should be ready. That was amazing, isn't it? It's Nicholas Witchell. Oh, the bomb. No, no, that's not the first. Come on. No, it's always difficult in it to. To sort of find something that's good each week. Right. Last week we did the chimp. It is for us. Yeah. We had the chimps who were running a health spa. We've covered the one who nicked a car to go on to Spain, you know, to sort his future out. All. All shite. The hairdresser. I think he's. You know, we've done that one. The little monkey hairdresser. This week we're looking at monkeys that they use in. Do you know, like, monkeys. They know. They know how, like. I've lost the will to live, Steve. Well, I don't want to do it. Well, come on. Just come on. What are monkeys good at? What are monkeys good at? Yeah. Well, running small businesses, cutting people's hair. Yeah. Yeah. They love Spain. Oh, and foiling bait, robbery. Yeah, they're great. Well, something else they're good at, right, is like, weighing up the situation. Oh, God. If you stick them in a. In like, a field with loads of, like, obstacles on it, right, they go that sort of. Yeah, I can get over that. And I climb over that. I'll swing from there to there, that sort of thing. Right, okay. So the people in charge of somewhere, I thought, somewhere I thought, we can use that. We can use that skill, right? And what, what. What they've done is they've got a load of little monkeys, right? They've given an IQ test, yeah. And the ones that score above 80. Right, get to produce this show next week. Join the army. Right. How do they join the army? And what do they do? They just. What they do is they Set little obstacle courses up for them. They do that. They do a cross country run. They do the Alps. Yeah, okay. And then once they've done all that, they make them a little uniform. Made to measure. Little uniform. Slightly longer arms, shorter legs than usual. Yeah, yeah. And basically then they try to use a gun and that sort of thing. Yeah, of course they are. You're talking rubbish again. This, this came through literally, you know, pretty late, late on. So. So you've not had a chance to incorporate all the facts as usual. Just have a look. Right. It's the interest. The bit I'm looking for is. Well, a while they're doing it. Why are they doing it? Yeah, why do we need monkeys in the army? And secondly, why are we giving them guns? I'll just check to see if any of that. We only let gays in recently. Yeah, talk amongst yourselves. Yeah. I can't read it. That's too much pressure. But it's rubbish. They don't get. Again, it's the way that there are things, there are animal cores, right. There are horses, there are dolphins, sea lions. You know, there are lots and lots of animals in the army but they don't have to pass an obstacle test as such and they're not taught to fire guns. You straight away assume that they're going to be. There's going to be loads of squads of men and then just one little monkey in the middle like he came second on the test. He's in. He's in, boys. What do you think Steve? You've read it. Well, as ever, Carl, this is an arbitrary email sent by one of our listeners. You know what Ricky and I think of them. And so we're not really basing this on hard evidence, we're basing it on the ramblings of one of our listeners. Rubbish. Once again, lazy rubbish, uncorroborated nonsense. The stupid test that you got wrong, Rick. That sounds like monkey news to me. Sky Digital channel 864 XFM. I wanted to play this adverts for you on XFM 104.9. Well, that's about it. We've had, we've had some tears and laughter. I mean the only real thing that we learned from today's show that's corroborated and is absolutely true is that remember Mancunian take off more sick days than any other area. 11 days per year compared to sort of like 8 Liverpool. And from that witch triple 8. Do not trust Mancunians. Well, I'm not saying that I think that's a bit harsh. I'm saying, you know, make sure you get in right in that they're not going to have more than sort of like the average number of days off per year. Yeah. Or if they start taking loads off, fire them. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? Right, Carl, We've had a good day. We're gonna end with a beautiful song, aren't we? Just to show we're all still friends to Jimmy Webb and his version of Galveston. See you next week, I guess.",
