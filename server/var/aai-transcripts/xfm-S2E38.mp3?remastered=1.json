  "text": "Badly drawn boy on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky James, with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. I'll tell you what the son is then. Oh, this Thursday. This Thursday at the Grosvenor House Hotel. Yeah. Everyone in radios, anyone has entered their show in different categories, saying, oh, you know, they get it down to, you know. Winners this year included the brilliant Dominic Mohan, former showbiz editor of the Sun. Lots of. Lots of people won. Lots of people won. Lots of people won gold. Lots of people won silver. Lots of people won bronze. We didn't get a sausage. Nothing. This show was deemed not. Not worthy of anything. I mean, not. Not a looking. The panel looked at and said, well, no, definitely not radio. Didn't get it. Didn't get a vote. See that, that annoys me on so many levels. Let me. Let me tell you one, right? I've never complained about losing reward, okay? Ever. Yeah, in. Mainly in tv. I know we've won a lot, but we've been beaten. A couple beaten by Peter K. Good luck to him. He's brilliant. Beaten by Phoenix Knights in sitcom. A lot of people like that more than the office and vice versa, right? No qualms. But the shoddy shite that I heard that night, beating us, I was furious. I don't understand. There's. There's people regional. It sounds like hospital radio, right? They've. I mean, I shouldn't even be on xfm. I thought, you know, it. It's beneath me. Yeah, yeah. And I thought, well, give him a hand, right? Let's show them. And I want to know the panel was as well. I. I do not believe it. How can they dip? I was looking back over some of the shows, right, before we go, Carl and I've just done a little excerpt of, you know, a trailer of what we. What we do, what we're about. And I don't know how the panel could overlook this play a bit. Carl, please. Shaking her muff, minge and tits around does not make her a hoe. Then what does? These kids with big heads. Carl, what are you talking about? Oh, my name is holy. Right? There's this monkey that was on a train station, right? What? If you mean to mean penis, it. Was me down syndrome, son. Oh, chimpanzee that. Monkey news. So we've still got monkey news coming up. You're an idiot. You know what I mean? That's, to me, quality broadcasting. I don't know how they can say that isn't worthy. That's what we sent in to the Sony people. They listen to that. How they didn't think that was dynamite stuff. It doesn't make sense. I've been thinking about this since Thursday because I've been a little bit down in the dumps. What I think it is is that with the radio, with the TV show, the TV stuff we've done, Rick, we put a lot of work into that. We get the script, we got the script. We spend a lot of time on it. What this show is about, it's very much about spontaneity. It's about our personalities. And I don't think we're ever going to win an award for our personalities. I think that's where we're going. You know what I think? I think that when we're together with the auteurs of the Office and you know, and we're strong on it and we're just two. Where we write it, we direct it, you know, we cast it, we worry about the font and stuff on the, you know, we do everything. There's a weak link in our midst. On the radio show. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just trying to think what the common factor is. Because on the award winning TV show, it's bliss. You and I. Yeah. I don't know. Well, I'll tell you what, can we play a record and let me think about this. Because there must be something. There must be something. There's gotta be a factor that isn't. In the Office, that's in this. That means that the Office is award winning. And this is a pile of shite. Brown Sugar by the rolling stones on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky R. Stevie Merchant and with us, Carl. Carl Pilkington, the third. Third member of this team. Team. We and me and you do the Office. Award winning. Yeah. And us three do this. Do this show. No awards, nothing. Carl, what are your thoughts? What do you think's wrong with the show? Why do you think the panel listened to our show and said that is awful? It's not actually a radio show. Well, can I just point out, many people may not realize that last year we won a bronze. So we've actually gone down. We've actually slid off the list entirely. I know, but I mean that, that. Yeah, but Carl wasn't really as involved last year. Well, I remember last, last year it was very much you and I. Y. Yeah, I mean, we just, we just started out on it. Yes. I mean, so you can't really. You can't really compare. Hold on though. Interesting. What do you think, Carl? What do you think there was? Any thoughts? I see what you're getting at. Right. But you're not stupid. But when I put the compilation together. Yeah. I made sure that it was mainly you two. So don't, don't be, don't be doing that. Don't be playing that game. So you also. You put the compilation together. Right again. Ah, right. Interesting. Because we were involved with that. We usually do the office edit the Office and everything. We have to find a cut on the office. So you. I see. So yeah, you had your fingers all over it. Interesting. So. Oh, well, that. So the tape was the smoking gun and whose fingerprints were on it? Carl Pilkington's. Yeah. That's interesting. We didn't get a sausage. But you know, do you know what? Seriously though, you know, you. Well, I don't mean seriously, it is his fault. I know but I mean we, we. It's our fault as well because we should have known better. Right. But. Than to employ him. Yeah, but I actually think it's a slap in the face. I want to know the panel was a lot of Sony are thinking just handing it out to the same old people. You know what I mean? Every clip they played was a funny phone call. Do you know what I mean? And so I'm actually sending our funny phone calls in. So if anyone, if anyone, if anyone cares, I think, I think we should knock us on the head as a protest against Sony. As I said, I've never complained before about Luna, but I mean this one. Don't know what. Don't know what I think I want. I or I want someone on the panel. It was entertainment. I want someone on the panel to phone up and say why they think this show is rubbish. Well, I apologize. Well, I'm not apologize if they stand by if they tell me why. You know, because you know, listen to that. That clip there. I can't see anything wrong with that as. No, sure. As sort of, you know, daytime radio. It's interesting. I mean I don't think our number one fan Dickie Anderson, Richard Anders was on the. On the panel. Although he here has emailed in maybe why we. What is Dickers doing, man? Dickers says commiserations on not winning a Sony. I can't believe he didn't win. I mean apart from your show's obvious lack of quality and effort. Having a monkey for a producer, offering the biggest load of tat as competition prizes, saying hairy Chinese kid 48 times every show. Rockbusters not bothering to turn up for weeks on end only having three listeners introducing the comedy characters. Camp David Har, Harry Fook, which I think he spelled wrong there. Stephen Merchant. I'm not a character. Apart from insulting every race, religion and sexual orientation. Bickering like schoolgirls. We haven't done everyone yet. We have not insulted everyone yet. There's loads to go. Despite the fact you generally bring misery into the lives of anyone who listens. I thought you were sure fire winners. Better luck next year. Well, I mean a couple of constructive, you know, criticisms there, but generally I still can't nail it. Was he on the panel? Well, I don't think so. I don't think so. He's a fan, so. Yeah, well, no, he's clearly a fan. I mean he obviously loves the show because he's. I mean he has hit the nail on the head which. Yeah, but what should we do? Should we give up or should we try harder? That, that's always my dilemma. Sure. Yeah. I mean I've. I've always gone for the first one. Give up. Yeah, why bother? Yeah. If that. If they can't see, just give. Just give us the award and then worry about it later and we won't let them down. Yeah. Now they've got. They've got blood on their hands. We're gonna. Yeah. What should we do to give a month, couple of months notice? I think so. Okay. Well there you go. Seriously, I mean I'm gonna be wacky now. We haven't told Andrew, but I think. We'Ve won our course with this show. Yeah. Yeah. So let's, let's. Okay, we'll give it a month. And it's because the Sony's didn't give us anything. Play record. You gotta do a bit longer than that. No, we haven't gotta give a month's notice. No, you gotta work till about September if you're gonna. No, we haven't. No, we can give a month's notice with, you know, whatever they give the money about somewhere. Well, you give your money back. Yeah, I know. What are you gonna spend your 80 quid on? True. By the way. Red hot Chili Peppers XFM 104.9. So a few more shows. I hope Sony are happy. I should encourage. You know, we've only been radio, you know, a couple of years. Exactly. You encourage young talent like you. Yeah. Instead of giving it to Radio 1 and Radio 2 and the old War Horses. We just had a quick email, I wonder if you could answer this. It's James from NW1. He says Ricky, is Carl going to be on this week's show. Please let me know as I may. Listen, if he's not. Sadly, he is here. I mean, people are already turning against you, Carl, because they've seen what's happened. Yeah. I think they've probably realized that we've. I think we gave you too much, I think. Exactly. I think we got a spoiled sort of kid now and it's sort of like, you know, we knew, we knew how bad he was, but we were trying to sort of bring him out of his shell a little bit. Yeah, encourage, you got. Encourage sort of children like Kyle. Well, yeah, exactly. To sort of fend for themselves. But I like the fact that Dickie Anderson had that wonderful ran. I mean it was an articulate email, it was quite long and he must have typed it immediately, I'm thinking, because he's a fan of the show and he thinks I'm a, you know, a genius. We need a P.A. sure, don't we? Yeah, yeah. Do you reckon he'd come and work for us? Well, it can't be any worse than what we've already got. I know. You know. So there you go then. We're giving up. We're giving up radio. We're going to concentrate on television. Carl's going to probably go back to what, your little. Just doing your sound. The thing I won a silver for at the Sonys. Funny that, innit? Oh, you won a silver, did you? I got silver, yeah. What was that for? Doing the proper job that I do here in the week. Well, no, it was two of you for a start. Yeah, well, there's three of us. Can't even get a bronze now. Who's the weak link? Right, well, bit weird, eh? Let's get, let's look, let's not argue. We haven't got many shows to do. To be fair though, this show is. I think it's more to do with the fact that you talk on this show that has brought us down. Right. I haven't said anything hardly today. No. Well, this is an award winning show potentially. We'll add this one in for next year. If you could just keep stum, we might have a chance. All right, well, coming up. Right, let's put it behind us. Okay. Let's draw a line under it. We had a meeting yesterday. We thought we better, you know, for the last few shows plan it a little bit and me and Steve come up with a great idea. We're gonna offer Carl money to do stuff. Yes. That's the quality of the ideas on this. Yeah. And I bought some money in. There's a lot of little stuff because we had him. We had him showering with our mate Johnny for a thousand pounds yesterday. Yeah, we just got into a discussion and then one of us suggested that how much would it cost us to pay you, Carl, to have a shower with another man? Not. And there's nothing. No, no, there's nothing going on. You just. You're just in a shower, normal shower. You're just watching. Washing each other. Not each other, just yourselves, just having. A chat, having a shower. Yeah, but it's a regular shower in a regular house. It's not shower. And he went, fine. He got £1,000 out of it. He wouldn't do 900. He got a thousand pounds out of it. But then we said, and we'll have to watch to make sure you do it. And he went, no, that's weird. So. But why, what's it. This is what annoys me though, right? The whole idea of, oh, what would you do? Right. I bet you missed out there when we started this chat saying, oh, I wonder what you'd do for money. It did start off with, would you rub Dale Winton's neck? Would you give Dale Winton a massage for 20 quid? Yeah, but you have to say no. 500. We're trying to find out what your price is. What price, Carl, is the name of the show. So would you give dad Whitman just. He's got a knot. He's got a bit of a knot. He's stressed. He's been doing Supermarket Sweep and he's furious. One of the contestants was answering back, calling him names and he's got all knots in his neck. You just put. Just give him a little bit of a. Five minutes. A little neck massage. How much would you do that for? He's naked and it's just a little neck massage. Nothing. There's nothing going on. It's like. See, there you go. You're naked as well. It's just the two of you naked, up. Giving him a little massage. No, no, seriously, would you. Would you give him. Okay. Would you. Would you give me a foot massage? For how much? Well, that's. Well, that's. What's your price? And what are the rules, though? Can I wear gloves? No, no, no. Just, you know, let's start off simple. Would you take off my shoes and socks. For. I'd do it for like 50 quid. Okay, 20 quid to take off one shoe and one sock. But, like, you mean it. You just take the shoe off, you go and as you're putting down my sock, you pull the sock down slowly, you look me in the eyes and go, what lovely ankles. Seriously, how much? What price? 20 quid a foot. 20 quid a foot? That's gotta be worth it. So 20 quid you will take off my. We'll put on some soft music, right? No, I don't need it today. That's what I was saying to you yesterday. You always need it. You know what I mean? No, you don't. At the moment I'm quite happy. Give it to a homeless person. Give it to a charity. Don't need it. Are you still gonna shower with Johnny for a thousand pounds? Not now. Because you said. And me and Steve are just gonna stand in the corner and watch. Well, you've got to make sure you do it. You might go in there and just like wet your hair and come out, pay Johnny 500 quid and go, yeah, we had a. How will we know? Sorry, I'm quite interested about the shoe and sock. I'm back to the shower. You just have to wash yourselves. We have to inspect that. It's really clean because we want you to wash certain parts. Really? Why have you both got to be in there, then? Well, no, there's one of us. Can we just take. I mean. Yeah. Or can Steve film it as evidence? Just as evidence. Or. I'll tell you what, we'll leave the DV camera in there with. Neither of us are being. And then we can just watch the video. Are you a couple of vendors? Well, I shouldn't be in. Are you a couple of vendors? No, no. But can we. Can we discuss further the taking of the shoe and the sock? Because I think there's £20. I'm willing to pay £20 to see that. Pretty in Pink Psychedelic Furs on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais, with me, Steve Merchant and our little pet monkey, Carl Pilkington. Carl. So 20 quid, tenor each. Me and Steve will pay good money. Right, we'll see you. All right. I reckon even Andrew Phillips, the head of XFM, would probably give you an extra 20 quid. If. If this is entertainers, I think it will be to the listening public. Just undo my shoes. Nice. And Steve, we're going. Carl's now just gently undoing the knives. Yeah, he's releasing the tongue of the shoe. Well, don't preempt anything. Okay, so come round then, Carl. He's gently pulling down the sock. You just said you'd do it for £20. Come on, you didn't do it for £20. You said you'd do it. I'll say you work me up like that and then you just. Come on, come on. Take my shoe and socks off and put it down. Pull the sock down slowly and go. What lovely ankles. No, because we had that chat yesterday about. Come on, Khan, you just said you'd do it. Yeah, but I don't really need. If it was more money, I might. I might do it. Oh, that is typical. Okay, firstly, we had little wage on the Sonys and you owe me ten pounds, so count my ten pounds as part of that. Exactly. So that's my ten pounds, so you already owe me that anyway. So I'm demanding that instead of giving me the cash, you do this. Yeah, And I'll give you the cash and I'll give you 10 quid just because I, you know, I've got a bad back and I need someone to help me take my shoe and sock off because I think I'm getting that airplane thing where my feet are swollen up. Yeah. Yeah. You've been auditioning people for that job, haven't you? All week. Come on. I ran it past Suzanne last night. Right. Because I knew you were going to do this. Yeah. And I said, would you be annoyed if, you know, I know we need a new kitchen and that. Yeah, but can I leave it? And she said, it's up to you. You do what you want. You're not interested in what Suzanne thinks. Yeah, I. I don't. You just said that you would do it for £20. We are offering you £20 just to take. I mean, I assume you take that off as a mate. If I. If I twisted my ankle playing football and I was. I hurt my back. Yeah. I go take my shirt and sock, off you go. Yeah, no worries, mate. I assume we do that for a mate who'd hurt his ankle. Yeah, but it's not the same. Toya bound Wayne Sleep's foot when he was bouncing on his bed and hurt his ankle. She didn't expect money from it. She didn't want Sleep to pay out money. The singer of Mystery does not need Wayne Sleep, probably our greatest dancer since Lionel Blair, to pay money to help his ankle out. I thought we were mates. It seems to me that you've already lost us a Sony this week. The very least you could do is bend down. Now take your shirt off, move on. No, come on, Carl. Seriously, we're doing this. Take the serious out, Carl. I just done it. It's too. Carl, why Not. I'm so angry. Yeah, because you said you would. You've welched on the thousand pounds showering with Johnny. Johnny doesn't even know about this. So Johnny's probably lost out of money. I suppose you'd split some up with him for having the shower with you to get you the money in the first place. So the problem is this, Carl. People now are listening, expecting to hear this. That's why we didn't win awards, because you'd never go through with it. You've promised them something and you're not going through with it. Play a record. You're just like all the girls I speak to. See. A little surprise for you there. That's Coldplayer here. They're live through there. Thanks. Can you hear me? Can I hear me? Yeah. Brilliant. Do you want to. Do you want to say a few words? Yeah. I'll have a quick word with Chris. Lead singer. Chris. Chris, good to have you here. Hello. And how's it going with Gwyneth Paltrow? Brilliant. Yes. She's a lovely lady. Yeah, I thought so. Yeah. I saw her in Shakespeare in Love. She's good in that. If you would pass that on to her. Just say it's going right. You gonna get married? Yeah. So I marry either her. That's Julia Roberts. Yeah, either one is good. I know you're on holiday at the moment in Hawaii. I read in the. No, today. No, you're actually here, actually. Okay, gotta go now. Got to go. All right, just a couple of quick. See you later, Chris. Yes, sir. Ricky. So that's the sort of guests that's kind of guests. We're just trying to up. Just like Jonathan Ross. We've got guests like Jonathan Ross. That's Coldplay. Just popped in. Just popped in. So if you're the Sony people listening, you know. And we've still got Kyle to take off my sock for 20 quid. Okay, let's do it now. Let's just get it over with and do it now. Come on, Carl. Let's get our cash out then. Rick, there's £10 right now. No, no, no, no, no. You don't know him because he owes you 10. So I just have to pay him 10. Okay. Yeah. So go on then. Just say not whilst Coldplay are here. They had to shoot off. Come on. I don't want to do it. Why not for half an hour? Okay. Why won't you do it? It's ridiculous. You won't have a shower. You won't take my shoes and socks off. You Won't do anything you won't give. Dad wouldn't have rub down. What will you do, for Christ's sake? I don't want to do it. So for me, Mum and dad are like, I've heard about how well I'm doing in London. Yeah, right. They've heard about, you know, the Sony Awards and that. They're talking to the mates. They're saying Carl's doing well for himself. Yeah. Let's have a listen to him on Sky. Yeah. Tuning in. I'm taking off socks for money. That'll be the first time that anyone in your family has actually made, you know, money without stealing. Yeah, let's just do it quick then. Because it's honest money getting on my nerves. It's actually annoying. Excellent. Excellent. All right. Honestly, no. Why? He's just taking a 10 off me. Right, okay, okay. You can't do it properly. Just gently. I can't see what's happening. Pretend I'm working on shop. There's nothing normal. Come on, just get it done. What's that whistling? What's whistling? What's the whistling? Okay, now do it properly, gently. It's a sweaty trainer, which just makes it all the more sweaty. Just gently caress it. Caress it. There's someone watching in the office. It. There. Don't. Just gently ease the shop. Just like working on a shoe shop. There's nothing. Nothing weird about it. Just gently ease down. All right, now it's just. Come on, gently do it. Don't just rip it off. Slowly, slowly. Tease it, tease it. Oh, God, I don't like this. I just wasted 10. That wasn't enjoying. Now, wait a minute. You've got to say something nice about my ankle. Say, you've got lovely toes and I love your ankle. You got nice toes and that. Say it properly. I don't like it anymore. Do it. And you've got to say. You've got to. You've got to say for the tenor, otherwise you're taking it back. You've got to say what lovely ankles you've got, but in a sweet, seductive voice. You got nice ankles. That is not how you would seduce a woman. You would not seduce a woman like that. Carl. Suzanne. Imagine that. I don't know. I don't feel good about it because. I want to see if we can get him to massage your table. See, I don't know what's worse. I mean, I didn't like the feeling much. That wasn't very nice because it was all. It was all rough and I, you know, and he said, he's a skinhead and he's playing on the feet. And then I thought, I've degraded him. So I don't know why I feel worse about argue. You can keep the tenor that you owe me if you massage his toes. No, I'm not doing that. No, we paid him, he's done it. Yeah, the shoes are back on. We're sweet. Somewhere else next week. Someone else next week. Okay, if you'd like to Carl to humiliate himself for money, email him. Suzanne was surprised that I was like, last night. I told her about it. Why did you do that? I don't feel. I don't know what I feel now. That's not good. I don't know. That's not good, is it? And she just said, well, you know, you don't like chucking money away and that. And it was funny because we got talking about when we bought our first flat in Manchester, right? I bought a bed, right? Didn't have much money. And what annoyed me is I bought the bed and it turned up and I said, where's the mattress? And they said, well, you don't get. You don't get a mattress with the bed. You gotta buy that separately. And I was like, well, that's not a bed then, right? So I didn't have any more money. Suzanne's at work. So I thought, well, I don't want to stress her out at work and that, telling her we haven't got a mattress for the bed. I had a word with me dad, right? He knew a mate who had one in the back of a van, right? He said, I'll have a word with him. He'll let you have it. Got the van, brought it round, stunk a diesel in that. But I thought, well, it's free, it'll do. They brought it up, stuck it in the spare room. Suzanne got home, she looked at the bed, she said, that looks all right. So where's the mattress? It's in the next, next room. But I thought, I won't tell her because, sure, she won't like the idea. She went in, the room, stunk of, like, petrol fumes and that. Yeah, what's going on? I said, well, it's a mattress. Didn't come with a bed, so I've sorted one out. I've got this off my dad and we didn't have one night on it. She said, get rid of it. Yeah, I had to go and ditch it. I don't know what she was thinking. One of your father's friends is Dr. Driving around in a van with a mattress in the back. Yeah. Was this serial killer. I mean, and she didn't want to sleep on it. Let's go from Silence the Lamb. What kind of a cheapskate issue. What kind of a woman is she that she won't sleep on a mattress that has been in the back of a Transit van? Petrol, diesel, probably urine and Christ knows what else. Oh, so, you know. Would you swap pants with Steve for 50 quid? Now, you don't have to look at him. You go in the toilet, he takes his pants off in the toilet, leaves in there. You go in, right? You come up with your trousers on. You go in, right? Take your pants off, put his pants on. Leave your pants in the toilet. Come out, you got his in there, you come out, you swap pants. At the end of the show, you put it back. How much? When you say pants, what do you mean? Just underpants. Underpants. No, I'm not doing on the. Why? Why not? Seriously, these refresh on Thursdays for the awards. Do you know what I mean? But I mean, it would claim the price. It's gonna be more than 20 quid. It's gonna be more than 20 quid. It'S gonna be. It's gonna be like 80 quid upwards, I think. No, clean on today. They were clean on today in their boxes. It's as bad for him as. You don't remember that. Thanks for that. 50 quid. Really? Play a record. No, hang on. You just said you'll give me 50. Quid if you go and swap pants. I don't know what's in it for me. I don't know why I'm doing this. It started off as torturing Carl, but not only am I out of pocket, I don't actually want you two to swap pants or touch my ankles. Stevenson. I don't know what I've done this. I'm the victim here. I've paid out and I don't even like it. Play a record. I want to think about this. I mean, I've got 50 quid if you. As long as we can swap the pants but both be in the room at the same time. Band of gold by the artist who featured in a recent Rockbuster clue, which was. I think the Jamaican fella needs an aspirin for his head. And that goes course to free the pain. Brilliant. Rockbuster's coming up in it. Carl. We. We settle now. Get it. Get it going. No, let's, let's, let's. I thought we weren't doing this anymore. I know. I don't know what happened. I don't know. I mean, but I mean. I mean, we're shooting off in a couple of weeks, so. Yeah, what difference does it make? We might as well, now you've mentioned it, it's a good time. Go on then. Right, three eclipse it. Cryptic clues, like the one you just heard there. First one, craptic. That is craptic a word. First one, my younger brother spotted you the other day. Right, that's the cryptic clue. My younger brother spotted you the other day. The initials js. JS for the band. Second one, that champagne belongs to the boxer's kid. The way he looks up like it's Oscar Wilde. It's that champagne belongs to the boxer's kid. The initials are AM and the third one, the vibrators and the initial B. What? The vibrators and the initial is B. So the first one. My younger brother spotted you the other day. I know that one. That's ridiculous. Js, the phone's going. Second one, that champagne belongs to the boxer's kid. Am. And the third one, the vibrators, the initial B. So email in and you win. We can say the prizes later. Well, I tell you what, this is terrible. I mean, we didn't even say the prizes. We weren't gonna do this. The phones go in. Look at the phones of garment. Carl, did you ever do paintings and drawings at school and then bring them home and your mum put them on the fridge? No, not really. I never brought them on. What, did you just screw them up and throw them in the bin? I just left them at school. Yeah. Never had a bag. XFM, Radiohead. There, there on XFM. 104.9. You see? No, wait. What? This is giving me an idea because I think what the best thing about this show is what happens when the records are playing because we. We sort of. Last example. Inarticulate. Yeah. Didn't have anything planned. Well, I started my mouth moving, but I didn't have anything planned. Yeah. Like, why was that? Why? Why don't you have anything planned there? What? Why didn't you know what you're gonna say then? Because what were you doing when Radiohead was on? Well, I've made Carl a new uniform that he has to wear in the second hour. What did I do? You got tissue paper? Yeah. Toilet roll. Yeah. Ripped a bit off. Yeah. Made a little tie for me and put some in my ears. Yeah. So we had earplugs and matching tie. Yeah. And he looked good, didn't he? Yeah, he had earplugs and matching tie and I. And squeezed it in there and he went, I can't, it'll irritate me. So I'm thinking of things all the time to make this more fun for me. Yes. And it is just like that. Can I. Sorry, Quick question, Steve. Just want to raise a little point. Go on. You say that you're spending most of your time thinking about how you can make this more entertaining for yourself. Yeah. Is it worth ever considering the listeners? Well, I think that if. If you're happy, they're happy. I'm not sure that's true. I've been monitoring a lot of feedback on email and stuff. It doesn't appear to be the case. But that's because Carl won't go along with stuff. Sure. I mean, they could have seen on the webcam his little matching. Matching earplugs and tie that I made. I just did a cartoon that went for £350. Right. On the. On the website. Right. So that's. That's one now. Yeah, we're gonna do it. We'll make it really good. We're gonna give him lots of stuff and sign DVDs, everything. So that's great. 350 quid. Who was it? I think her name was Joanne. It's not definite yet because we haven't got the money offer. Wow. You know, you gotta trust them in you. And so I think people would love to have had a matching. You know, I'd have signed it and everything. Little matching earplugs and necktie made out of toilet roll. Yeah, yeah. You know, and he. And he doesn't wear it, but I had a great idea for a show, Right. We filmed the behind the scenes. Right. Of each show. So, you know, you get, you know, a CD of what went out, but you saw what happened behind the scenes. Right. And it follows us through a week. Right. And it's called X Men 3. I see. Because of XFM. Yeah. Right. And then we can film all car. What Carl looks like when I'm squeezing his head, what he's like when we're trying to make him touch us, all that sort of stuff. What, he's getting all stressed out in the day and we just pop up. Right. The. What he looks like, his little head, everything. And would this be broadcast on tv? I think so. Choice. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I. Again, because I. I mean, I'm very much in the center of the storm. I'm very much the eye of the storm. Yeah. And I know That I myself would not want to watch that. Really? No, because it's any negative, Carl. It was like this when you came up with Cheapest Chimps. He wanted to drop Rockbusters. What was the other thing he didn't like? That other TV idea I had. Yeah. What? Putting the baby in the room, setting on fire and see if he can make his way out. Setting the room on fire. Let's not get silly. No, no, no. But he didn't like that, did he? I mean I don't. I don't want to sort of. I don't want to blow my own trumpet but it does seem to me that my criticism of those things is probably justified. I mean cheap as chimps. Where is it now? It's Scott McIntyre took it. Not really, Carl. Not really. It is but a pitiful memory. Both. Your game show idea is terrible. This TV show idea. I think again it's only interesting to you, Rick. This is what you fail to realize. You've got no sense of the greater public. They don't, to be honest. I'm just taking this from what people are emailing in. They're not interested in. See, I don't read emails. They're not interested in Carl. I don't read the emails. They're not interested in Carl but. They're not interested in Carl. But if we did a documentary about him like they did about Oliver the human Z or that the girl that was older than her mum or you know, all those other sort of things. I think if we actually did a definitive documentary and got in doctors to talk about him and showed him that. Psychiatrist from Big Brother. Yeah. And just talked about it and then showed him in his environment, I think it would be. I think it'd be brilliant. I think it'd be a brilliant show. But I think that's interesting. I think you're right. Some kind of anthropological study of Karl. Fascinating. You making a little neck of him. I'm not so convinced. But that'll be part of it. Play Record. Let's think about this because I think this is an idea if any broadcasters listening like Greg Dyke or, you know, we'd even go to Channel five with this I think, wouldn't we? I mean alternatively, if you'd like to incorporate Carl into some kind of Blue. Peter appeal, let's do so much. Let's just get Carl. Look at his face. How could you not see? A lot of people still don't know what you look like, Carl. Play Record. That's across the great divide from the band, Rick. I Bought a little treat for myself today. I've been meaning to buy these ever since I moved to London. I'm sure everyone listening has seen them. Maybe you don't have them in your own collection, Carl. I don't know if you've come across them in the past, but it's the postcards now. Most of you, if you. If you're a tourist in London, you see the postcards there. I think there's one with a punk, isn't there? With green. Yeah. From 1977. Yeah. There's one which is like probably. It's probably a grandfather now. Probably something like a view from London at night. And it's just black. Oh, yeah, that's a classic. I'm a fan of the. The baby covered in spaghetti. Yeah. That's brilliant. That happens a lot in London and the old East End. The baby outweighs the spaghetti. Yeah. Brilliant. Wonderful memory of London. Yeah. But I think to myself, how would I best want to remember London? Yeah. If I were a tourist from Prague? Maybe you want to send something home to your nan. To your nan. To Mama sitting. I mean, in Beetroot. Yeah. You want to say, I've been to London. I've been to the home or you know, the birthplace of some of the great names. Dickens. Dickens. Yeah. I've seen Big Ben. I've seen the Houses of Parliament. I've seen the wonderful things. The best way for me to remember that is a picture of a woman's breasts. Yeah. With pictures of cats painted on them. They are the most grotesque things. You've seen these before. They're awful. You can find these on any postcard stack. It's just a woman's best drawn a face on it. I think. I think it is that all the breasts from London. So there's all the breasts from London. And the other one, Carl, I think you've got there. What does it say? What's the little tag wear? A couple of swells. We're a couple of swells. It's just when were that? I mean, they've been around as long as I've been in London. I just don't know. I don't know who took them. Maybe I should just point this out. Incidentally, if you've not seen them, don't think that it's. It's a topless woman. It's just a disembodied breast. Yeah. Or in the case of a couple of swells, two breasts. I know, just awful. Looks like a snapshot. But. But what worries me is that what happened was that she was probably the equivalent of Carl and she had two mates and they went, well, how much? If we take your breaths, how much you do it, boy? 20 quid. Yeah. And they took a picture. Yeah. And you know how much it would have cost for us to paint faces on them and then take a picture? Yeah. Oh, that's awesome. I always wondered to myself who that person is. Oh, probably came down to get into modeling or something. I think if you pan further down, she's actually wearing a pair of your pants. I think if you pull out, she'll probably be unconscious with a knee lagging out of her arm. But I just. I just imagine, See, now, that would be a fair representation of London. TURING breaks Painkiller on XFM 104.9 A. Couple of emails, Rick, that I ought to notify you about. Holly is emailed in. She wants us to wish her good luck. She says that she's one of 15,000 women who will be walking 26 miles around London starting at midnight tonight in their bras to raise money for breast cancer tubes. No, no, no, no, no, no. Just regular ladies, I think. But I was at loose end, so that's something for me to do. No, I'll pop that and support them. Also, we got. We've got to say hello to Sonia, who's. It's her 18th birthday and we're going to play a little Smith's track for her later. So it's like we're trying. We're trying to be interactive. Yeah. I've seen how other DJs do it. They have phones, they go, and how are you celebrating tonight? Oh, we're just going out, foxy. Have a good time. Here we go. This is. You know what I mean? We've got to be. I've guessed we had. We had Chris Martin in from Coldplay, which is going to be a lot. Well, Chris is still here. Hello, Chris. How did you come up with the ideas for your songs? Just make them up in my head with the guitar. And how old are you now? 28. Thanks very much. More from Chris Martin later, I imagine. Cheers. We've also had. Thanks, Chris. We've also had an email from Jim. It's as easy as that. We've got an email from Jim. He says on the subject of postcards, his brother once met the bloke who posed for the photo on those biros that when you tip them up, the black ink kind of sinks away and it shows him nude. And he was apparently an aspiring model and he got paid $75 for it in Hong Kong in the 70s, Carl. Would you have done that? Would you pose nude for a pen for $75? I mean, inflation gone up. Let's double it every 10 years, say so. Yeah, 150. 300. I'll give you 600 quid to post news for biros that we give away for xfm. An XFM biro, where your clothes sink away when you turn it upside down. And what sort of shape was this fellow in? He's in pretty good shape. Yeah, I think. 600 quid. Yeah. I'll make it back on selling the bends. No, I won't do that. I always remember being at school, the first time I ever encountered one of those pens was a kid at school, Jason and I had one of his pens and he turned upside down and it was where the woman's clothes sink away and she's naked. And I remember sort of seeing it and him showing it to everyone, all the young lads and them thinking, this is amazing. And I always remember thinking it was like the idea that it was sort of a way to cheat teachers. Oh, there's Jason. He's just got a pen there with a picture of a woman wearing some clothes. That's fine. There's nothing wrong with that. If you bring the porn mag in, I'll have it exact. But. Yeah, but I can't. But I've always imagined. Can you imag. Imagine how embarrassing would it be to be to be caught masturbating over one of those pens? Businessman. Yeah, exactly. His wife catches him. Sorry. So what are you doing? Just. I'm just doing some writing with this, this regular pen. Right. What? Well, don't turn upside down. Ah. Can I just come around where you're sitting? Just. Why are you naked? The only thing I think more embarrassing would be to be caught masturbating looking into a mirror. Well, for you, maybe. For me and Cardi. We should give the Rockbusters clues again one final time before we give out the answers. And I should mention the prizes as well. If you still want to enter, we've got various things, a couple of CDs. Looking into a mirror. Let's move on from that. Club Anthems 2003 Stranger. Hey, I hate being nude anyway. Why? What do you mean you ain't being nude? It's not normal if you walk about. Do you walk around the house we're now on? No, because we've got windows. Yeah, but all right, with the blind shot or whatever. Well, I have a bath. No, no, say, like. Say like with, you know, with Jane and that. Are you happy walking about? No, I just didn't know I walk around in my pants or a towel. I won't. I won't purposely walk around nude for the sake of it. No, no, I know, but. But I. In the morning, I don't mind. When I get up, yeah, I go for a shower, but I don't sort of flaunt it about. I just wondered if that's normal or. Well, no. What do you mean? Is it normal if there's no one can see you then? No, like, but your girlfriend's in and that. But what I mean is. Yeah, it's like. You can put a pair of pants on, can't you? All I'm saying is put Steves on if you want. For 30 quid. What do you want? Do you want to put a pair of pants on now? No, it's just like you're asking me. Do it for a pen. What would you do, Right, what would you do, right, if you did that thing with Steve and you put. Left your pants in there. You went and you put his on. But there's. It was sort of like it was damp. Right, so Rockbusters then. We'll get this out of the way. Right, so. Surprises, Carl. I've mentioned there's a number of CDs. We've also got Wild Weather, a fascinating. It looks like two VHS set about weather. About various weather conditions around the world. That must be selling like hotcakes. Sian Lloyd could be in that now. Also signed by Norman. It's Fat Boy Slim's Big Beach Boutique. That must have been troublesome for the station. That has, you know, close ties with Norman to get hold of, but well done. And that's Fat Boy Slim Big Beach Boutique. So, yeah, there's a number of not bad prizes to give away there. And the clues were, Carl. First one was my younger brother spotted you the other day. The initials js. We had that champagne belongs to the boxers kid. That was am. And third one, the vibrators. That's rubbish. That one. And the initial B. We'll give away the. The prizes and the answers next. What are we gonna play a record or what we got coming up? We got Monkey News. Yeah, we got that. We got loads too numerous to mention at the moment. We've got any adverts? Got some of them. Oh, brilliant. Cram them in later. Excellent. Look forward to that. Joe Jackson. Good, good track, good tune. Well, it's on. Different for girls. Joe Jackson. Xfm 104. Point 9. A retro cut. Bit of monkey. Usually good, Carl, if you got that. Well, we're struggling here. We're struggling, Steve. Wait a minute, Rick. You say that, but wait a minute. The answers for Rockbusters are coming up right now. So you thought people were turning on. Oh, we've got. What have we done? We've done Take My Shoes off for Money. Take My Shoes off for money. We've done that. We've done. Oh, look at these funny postcard breasts. And we've done. We didn't win a Sony. Coming up, regular features. Got nothing, have we? Come on. Sometimes it's good. Come on, Carl, save us. You've got to save us. We've lost those answers now. We're doing them now, Steve. Right, first one, my younger brother spotted you the other day. Initials there. Js. That was Junior Senior. Yeah, good. I'll give you that. Second one. That champagne belongs to the boxer's kid. That was am. That was Alison's Moye. Alison's Moyer. Alison Moyer. Sorry, just give us the clue again. That champagne belongs to the boxer's kid. So Muhammad Ali's son. Yeah, Right. Alison's Moye. Brilliant. And then third one. Always an easy one in there for everyone, so they can set part the vibrators. The initials B. That's Buzz Cox. You can't say Cox. That's why we win. That's why you can't say Cox. Have we got a winner? We have indeed. I chose him because his name amused me, which is a bit hard. Not Mr. Tits. No, no, no. Gerald Preston. Sorry, Gerald. I don't know why that tickled me. It's so unfair. It only tickled me because it's not funny. There's nothing funny with Gerald Preston. There is nothing funn. It was because it sounded like it was a man of a different generation. I think that was my Preston. It sounded like. That's terrible. Right, Gerald. There's nothing funny about that name. There's nothing funny about that. Steve just made me laugh. I don't know why that made us funny, made us laugh, but it just tickled me. But, Gerald, whatever you think of your name, don't worry, because these prizes include. Something funny about Gerald Preston. I don't know, Gerald, if you're a fan of Wild Weather, but you've got a 2VH set coming to your way, so you certainly will be interested in extreme weather conditions by the end of that, I would have thought. Plus some arbitrary CDs, so good luck, Jerry. Oh, dear. Excellent. Right, Brilliant. Good that's that sorted. Right, let's have another tune and then maybe some monkey news. Yeah, well, actually, now you've sort of mentioned a bit of monkey news that I found something in the week. Right. That we've talked about in the past, right. That I've got some other monkey stuff, but this is just. Oh, forget it. What? Come on. What's the matter with you? Right. Do you know that thing we did ages ago when we were out one day and we're talking about monkeys in a room with a PC, and if you leave them in there long enough. Yeah. Eventually an infinite amount of monkeys or one monkey in an infinite amount of time will eventually type the complete word of Shakespeare. Yeah, we talked about that ages ago. I said it wouldn't happen. No, it doesn't make sense. You can't say it wouldn't happen. It doesn't make sense. It's a mathematical conundrum. It doesn't make sense. Go on. Anyway, right, they got a couple of. Monkeys, right, so not an infinite amount then. Okay, so. All right, but never mind. Yeah, got a couple of monkeys, put it in a room. Yeah. I don't know if it was. If it was one PC or they got. Got a job lot or whatever. Not an infinite amount then. And left them in there for a month. Oh, not an infinite amount of time then either. Okay, so two monkeys a month. Okay, go on. Yeah, I see the experiments working so far. About eight monkeys. Oh, eight monkeys. Oh, let me just work that out as a. A fraction of infinity. It's one or infinity. A into infinity. Oh, God. A month. And what happened then, Carl? Did they type. Did they type the complete watch of Shakespeare? I'm assuming they did. No, they. They. No, they only did a proportion of it. They just did Macbeth. What happened then, Carl? Please tell us. They didn't have anything. They didn't come up with anything. You're an idiot, Carl. You really are an idiot. Play a record. That's ridiculous. What did you expect? What did you expect? A bit of Keats and pastry of the radio times by one of them, the cleverest one. No, but what they did say is they didn't even get. They didn't even write one word out. No, you don't. No. Infinity or nothing. That's the point. There's a big leap between any number you could think of and infinity. In fact, an infinite leap. Do you understand the concept of infinity? Don't rub your eyes I lost him on. Do you? Yeah, didn't I? Right, play around. Did they type anything? Did they type nothing from like any of the book, any of the Tarzan books. But they must have read that. I mean, that'd be their favorite, surely. I'm stunned. I can't believe they didn't even do like a transcript of Every which Way But Loose. Yeah. I can't believe it. They must have chosen some really thick monkeys. They didn't type any of Charlton Heston's speeches from Planet of the Year. I can't believe it. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense. You'd have thought six monksies in a month would have done something. Yeah. At least a script for BJ and the Bear. The only thing that it was a monkey, not a bear. Really stuck in a moment. You can't get out of it by you talking. I know how they feel. Oh, just a quick thought. I just had a sudden thought. Just a little update on something we talked about ages ago on the show. You might remember I said once that if I ever met Dido, I thought I had a good chance with her. Yeah. Because she looks like the sort of woman that would work in say, a photocopying shop. Yeah. And she'd probably be quite charmed by. A secretary that sort of like wrote a couple of songs and the boss said I entered her in something. Yeah. And it won. She did them at the Christmas party. Everyone clapped. Exactly. Yeah. Well, anyway, just an update on that. So far nothing's happened. Yeah, but nothing's going on, so I'll. Keep you posted on that. Rick, I know you're interested. I imagine it's a foregone conclusion when you do though. We know when. When I hear you met her. You don't need to say anymore. Okay, well, just say. I'll let you just wink and say I met Dido last night and I'll go. Say no more. You don't need. I'll just look a little bleary eyed. Yeah. Yeah. And probably still wear the same clothes from the Mace. Yeah. Right. Anyway, I just thought I'd keep him abreast of that. Yeah. All the best from London, Carl. Come on, Carl, cheer up. You've had a good week. Do you have to do a month's notice? A little bit of friction. A little bit of friction between Steve and Carl. I think they're, you know, they're getting. To each other, which is he's underpants of pinching. Come on, Carl, cheer up. You're lucky. You know how many people would pay good money to. Carl, you had a good night out this week. You went to the Sony's. You had a free meal. That annoyed me. I don't. We came away empty handed. But yeah, it was a good night, wasn't it? You enjoyed that? Did you enjoy that? I hate it, but go on. I'm just finding more and more things are annoying me really. Like even like, how about Sony's night? Right? You've got a lot of respectable people going to that thing. You know, people who are high up at the BBC and that. Yeah. And just the way, you know, it's a posh night, there's people there with dinner jackets on and stuff. And then I went to the toilet for a wee old fella in there. So he looks, he looks like he's been in the, you know, the radio game for years. Probably done loads of award winning Sony stuff. Yeah. You know, all the BBC documentaries to do, in depth stuff. And I thought, you know, I wonder if I'll be like him when him and I'm old. I wonder if I'm as good as him thinking all that. He's having a wee in the next urinal. Farts. I know, yeah, he's just farts. Old fella in a dinner jacket probably hired. They try to. They think, well, I better do it in here. And it's sort of like a trumpet and everyone, everyone just goes, yeah, that's fine. What's up? That, you know. Yeah, I know what you mean. Is it. It's just the arrogance of doing it. You just did it. It was. It sounded like a lost whale. And he didn't sort of go and try and clinch it. It went. It carried on and then he went, oh, that was a good one. Really old fella must have been about 70. Oh dear. Well, better out than in. Yeah, but it's not that I wasn't. I wasn't brought up like that, you see. Right. Because I did it. I mean I never really did it that much as a kid. Sure. And then I was at my mum and dad's. You never. Sorry. You never did it that much as a kid. What party? Yeah. Okay. Not. Not just like, you know, as a joke. We are taping this for next year's Sony Award, aren't we? We're taping this, what we're talking about now, aren't we, to hand in, because this is. Go on. But I was at my mum and dad's, right, And Suzanne was sat on the floor in front of me and she was like, oh, rub my neck, it's hurting. So I thought, and I hate doing that. It really bores me. Well, she's your girlfriend, for goodness. I know. Dale Winton's different. You're getting paid for that. Go on. So I thought, the only way to shift her, I'll let one. So I did. Such a loving relationship. That's great. Doing the washing up badly. Yeah. She won't ask me again. What have you done? I've smashed the cups up and I've written in excrement across the wall. Well, that's no good, isn't it? Well, I won't do it again. Maybe the Marigolds. I'll do it. I've nailed the cat to the fridge. What's up with that? Go on. But, yeah, so I did that and it worked. She sort of got up and said, oh. And my dad said, what you do that for? Yeah, what was he thinking? So I said, oh, I hate rubbing a neck. Does me Edin. So he says, you know, I've never trumped in front of your mother for 40 years. Sorry, where was this Chiggly? Why is this family talking like this? Young Carl, I've never trumped in front of your mother in 35 years. Why? What? I don't know. What? No, it's just. It's just that he said, you know, we've done a lot of things in the family. Why did he say that? For what? He's never. He's never trumped in front of your mother. He just offered that information up. Well, he just was surprised that I did it. He said, where have you got that from? Yeah, well, intestines. I thought once. Imagine. Imagine there's a class of farting. Oh, we haven't. We haven't told our kids about. He doesn't do it. We haven't told them about it. We haven't. No. We don't do it in front of. You have to learn it, do you? No, no, but there's a. There's a place. That's what I was always told. Go on. There's a place for that. Cornwall. So. And my mum, you know, it's the same. She. She doesn't do it, right. If she goes to the toilet to, you know, do. Do what you got to do, she. She makes sure, like, she'll sort of say things like, are you going out for a walk? Are you going out for a walk? Does she think. Does she know that you're broadcasting this? Well, yeah. She's probably around at the neighbors now, listening. Yeah. Any of you gone out for a walk? Yeah. So she what? She kind of. She waits until everyone's left or she. Doesn'T like the thought that everyone do. You know, like, cats don't like you staring at them when they're doing it. I've never stared at a cat while it was doing anything. Have you ever had a pet cat? What do we go on? No, it's just that cat's. You know, if you get him a little litter tray. Yeah. I remember being told, like, now, when it does use it don't sort of go and look at. Puts it off. I was the same as a kid. Who comes and looks at you when you're on the bar. No, no. When I was a kid and I was in a nappy, right, I used to always, like, there was a corner in the kitchen that I'd always go to and everyone would be, why do. You go to the toilet? Because they had a nappy on. Oh, yeah, right. How old were you? 14Th birthday. About three or something. Yeah, right. And I used to always go to this corner and everyone. Everyone said, right, he's going to the corner. Don't. Don't stare at him. The thing is, I can so imagine you because you've got the same head. Yeah. You look like a baby. It's just the pain. His head. Would you. Okay. Would you put a nappy on for 50 quid? No. Yeah, Just. I'd just be. Just sitting. Just do your work anyway. Just sit in the corner. So I'm not getting it. I'm not doing that. Right. So. Yeah, my mum's like that and something else. She's. She's good at dinner party. Oh, no, Mrs. Pilkerson. Just in the corner. Just don't look her. Yeah, she's just in the corner of our kitchen. Don't just. What's she doing? Just. She's just doing her business, she says. There she is squatting. Are you going for a walk? Sorry, you were saying? Another. Another trick I've learned from her. Right. If. If you're using, say, a friend's toilet or something and you don't want to leave your mark, just use. Go down the toilet and flush it. Use a. Take a box of matches with you. Yes. Turn the place down, have a wonderful crap and just leave when the fire brigade get there. Who is it? Vines. Yeah. It's a good one. We don't go. Brilliant. Do you. If you're gonna talk, you do say something useful. Vines. They're homesick. Brilliant. Now, come on, we should do monkey news now, because I know you want to save it, but I think you should put your best stuff first. You never Know what will happen? You know what I mean? Always put your best stuff out there. Let me just get it out the. Okay, well, while he's getting it, could we have a jingle for monkeys? Yeah. Oh, chimpanzee. That monkey goes. Tell you what, right, about putting. Putting your best stuff first. Yeah. Do you know, Janelle was saying the other. The other week about in Chinatown, not really a town. Well, it's not. It's not a town, right? And like, the restaurants, the young, they. Have like, oh, those old dead ducks and chickens just hanging in the window. Yeah. An octopus and all that just hanging there. Yeah. And that doesn't, like, make you want to go in, does it? No. Sure. This morning, walking through Soho. On the way in, walk past this sort of strip joint place. This woman said, do you want to come in, sir? Right, turn around. She must have been about 80. So you're equating her to a hangy bit of octopus. She said performing and a chicken. I'm just saying again, put your best stuff at the front door. Yeah, good thinking. All right. Anyway, bit of monkey news that's been. It's been sent in. Right. Gareth in Catford. Right. Good work, Gareth. Basically, it's about this. This monkey. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. In the jungle. He's got a gig out and hairdressers. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? It's got itself a nice little job going in. And hairdressers as what it gets people sitting down and what it does before the people have their hair cut, that it sort of sits there and it goes through people's hair, makes sure it's clean and people are loving it. Right, so. So it's. So it's a pet monkey. Isn't to do with it getting a gig in an hairdressers. It's a pet monkey. It's not working at monkey and guy. Yeah. No, no, seriously, it's. It's in there. I think he might have started off as a job. And then. So what does it say? It says, Junior £15. Stylist, £35. Monkey, £63. It's in the jungle. It was wandering about. Maybe. Maybe it did. But it looks good. Its hair looks good. Someone thought, yeah. But never, ever, you see, people make that mistake with addresses. Anyway, I always say, well, if the address has got a good haircut, go to where he's going. Right, right. Because that's what I thought when I read it. Without having a good haircut. How often did you go to the. Addresses well, not that much anymore, but. But I used to always think that. Yeah. You used to go to a bloke who told me had his shack on a railway bridge that used to shake when a train went over. Yeah. Because it was two quid. Yeah. But before that, I've never had that much luck with addresses before. That was a. Was another place and it was run by sort of, you know, these sort of wannabe gangster type people. Oh, yeah, but they'd, you know, you go. What do you mean by wannabe gangsters? Well, sort of just. Just petty crime stuff. You go in for haircut and then you walk out with the video recorder. You know what I mean? You don't have to take it. No, I know, but they'd sort of spend ages flogging you that whilst cutting your hair. It was their thing. It's like. Right, sit down. You're right. Yeah. Oh, is that for the weekend? What do you think of maybe a Sony? Yeah, so and so that. That's when I stopped going there because it was like just what I. Haircut. I don't want to be. Which one said that you had the hair of a Chinaman? It's the fellow who worked in a railway station haircut. Well, he should know. And he's been around a bit clearly if he runs a shack next to a railway station. So just go back to monkey news for a second. So anyway, that's all. Yeah, I didn't quite follow why he. He still. He still. His salon is in the jungle or where is it? No, he. He was doing his. Doing what he does in the jungle. Right, right. He's walking about, he wanders into the hairdressers. Yeah. Maybe they didn't have him on like as a job straight away. He was just there. This is nice. He sat there picking the knits. Oh, Carl, I don't know where to start then. It's just that. It's not. It's the embellishment. You don't walk in. He walked from a jungle to an hairdressers. I mean, you're an idiot. You really are. I'd love to see you try and get a job in an hairdresser. If there was another monkey up for it, you'd never get a job. So he was good at that. People said, this is relaxing. Apparently he had really nice hands. Soothing on people's heads. He said, let's put him on the payroll. Let's put him on the payroll. What do you mean? I'll give you that. Okay, this is the news item, is it customers are queuing up to have their hair done at a salon in the jungle by a monkey. Judy, a pigtailed macaque has a reputation as the best exterminator of head lice in com Kane she is so good some customers fall asleep under her gentle touch. Regular amperon chicaima said Judy's hands are so soft and gentle I really feel I can relax. But you know that is doing what it does naturally. It's looking for like salt and stuff in the hair. Yeah Annette, it's not on the payroll. It doesn't complain about when it gets. When it gets deducted national insurance. It's not part of the union. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? But, but a good monkey news, you know backed up with. With good tabloid journalism. Yeah. With solid evidence there. So now that's. I think maybe we should start marking the monkey news. Rick, I don't know what you think giving it marks out of 10 maybe for both interest and validity. Well for interest I'll give it seven for Carl's. Carl believing that there was something to this monkey thinking it had a job and getting paid but it was also. Doing kind of perms two and coloring two. Yeah. Ridiculous again. Ridiculous. More monkey news next week hopefully. Let's just hear that jingle again. Oh chimpanzee that monkey news peace trained and that brilliant cat Stevens now. Well I've sort of enjoyed the last sort of, you know, hour or so after. After disappointment of the Sony's. I think we are going to give up to be honest. Do another week and then shoot off. Yeah. Knock on the head. Okay, we are doing it for a laugh anyway but if they're not gonna. Reward us for that then do you. Know what I mean? But I'll tell you what could. But what about this Carl, can you find out who was on the panel? Can you. But what difference does it make? Well I want to. I want you to interview. I want you to phone them up and, and I want to tell them why. Why they didn't think our show was. Yeah, let them explain themselves. Just explain themselves. They've got to stand by the convictions. Find them all, track them down. There's probably about three or what do. You expect then you're right. The monk in you should have, you know done the job for you. I just want people. I don't want to be. I don't want to sit in a room and hide. I want the three people on the panel. I'll find them out to say we didn't vote for you because we thought it was shoddy, amateurish, annoying. There was too much swearing. I go. Fair enough. Well done, mate. You. We didn't vote for you because Carl's voice is an irritant. Okay, okay. Well done, mate. You alright? We didn't vote for you because Gervais, you're a fat useless git who understands nothing about broadcasting. Yeah, and I'll go right, I'm not so happy with that. But at least you told the truth. But. Get him on the phone. Find out. Find out from Andrew. I noticed none of them have mentioned me, which is good. I'm pretty good. Yeah, yeah. They probably all love Steve. No one likes to pick on an invalid though. Do you know what I mean? That's. I'm just. We. We got a player request here for what's her name who's don't believe it. See Sonja, who's 18 today, we couldn't find William. It was really nothing worth Smith because whoever is in charge of the library, I mean they probably won an award for it but you know she didn't ask for 4 non blondes. So I found There is a light by the Smiths. So a week to go. Just. It's not. I'm not.",
