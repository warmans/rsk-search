So strong words. They can quote me on that if they want. Yes. I'm sure they'll rush to on their. One of their albums. Yeah, if they wanted. Well, listen, you're lucky I'm here, Steve. Okay. You can see, you know, something's happened. I've done them back in again. Right. I've got a special chair in here. I mean, agony. And I want the strongest painkillers I can get. I feel a bit. Carl. I had to call Carl up today and say, look, I don't know if I can make it in. Can you come and get me? He came over to my house. We got in a cab and he got me here. Right. While he was around my house, Jane showed him sort of camcorder footage of how I actually did it, of how. You hurt your back. And I wanted Kyle to tell you because I was actually worried that if I didn't turn up, what you'd say to me. Yes. What. What. What was I doing, Carl? Right. So I get round to his place, right? Says, right, hit play on the video, right? Have you ever seen a gorilla having a fight? I think I have, yeah. Yeah, it was like that. Him and his mate round at his place last night, decided to sort of have a bit of a wrestle. Yes. It went on. I mean, how much footage? Honestly, it was like a scene from Women in Love. Yeah, we. Dad about five fights. We had to stop at one point because his arm was bleeding. We've had about five fights. Yeah, well, we were wrestling. We were doing wrestling, right, in the lounge. Yeah. On our knees. And then sort of like zoom. And you know, and I kept. I kept winning with an arm lock. Yeah. And then the last time he sort of threw me and my back was done and I was, you know, it was Ian Morris. Yes, it was, you know. Yeah. No. Isn't he a editor of Comedy at Channel 4? Yeah. And the funny thing was that we. We'd had lots and lots of wine and we went out. You surprised me. Yeah, right. And we. Come on, come on, come on. I take film this and the time we filmed. I said, film this and tell me. And I took my shirt off. It's right there. And you can just slap in. Why? Can I just ask, though? I mean, it's a Friday night, you know. You had a couple of drinks, you know, some intellectual conversation. How does it get round to. Do you fancy wrestling me? Well, I'm having it filmed. Well, I was. It was on the couch, but I kept sticking my socks in his face to annoy. And then he hit me on the shin and I got sharp shins and it hurt. And I was going, I'll smack your face. And he's done kickboxing. And it's that thing like you're sort of joking. They go, come on, then. And you start, have you ever seen the thing where Jack Osborne fights that skater dude on the Osborne? I was very much the Jack Osborne figure. Right, yeah. The fat, bloated guy just came out of rehab. I'll tell you what it was like. Steve, have you ever seen, like, the David Attenborough stuff where, like, a tiger will be ripping a deer's head off and you think, why doesn't the camera crew stop it? Yeah. So I watch you thinking, why was Jane. Why is she not stepping in and intervening? Yeah. And the thing is, she said, right, you've seen enough, haven't you? And stopped it. So I don't know how much footage you got. It wasn't much. It wasn't much because your lounge is not huge and there's not much space between the. The back of the sofa and the table. There's no need. It was just. It was just a pain or a submission. So it was all over with, like, one of us throwing the other on the back arm. And how does it. I mean, how do you start with the resting match? Are you both stood up or you're. No, on your knees and you sort of, like, go together like ratting seals. Yes. Yeah. Oh, dear. Like a giant walrus. It's not gay. Play a record. Can we put that online? Can we get that on the web? That. That I would love to see. Better od. Stuart. Yeah. Stuart. Indeed. You need to say no more if people don't know what it is from that information. Gervais Merchant Pilt. Exactly. All right. Exactly. Rick. I was out last night in the Crouch End area and I passed her. I always. Things upset me like this. It was a restaurant. It was a little French restaurant, but you barely know, so you walk past. It was like a row of houses and a little French restaurant there open. It was kind of summery bistro. No one in there, Rick. It was about 10 to 10. I'm thinking, if no one's in there at 10 to 10 on a Friday evening, it's doomed. And it really Upset me. It genuinely upset me because I always think about the little French guy there, you know, he's put all his money into that. He's convinced his wife. Wife to do it. Yeah. You know, she's not convinced, but she's a great cook. Eve. Exactly. And it's already going down the pan. Do you know why you don't want French food in a hot summer's night. You want Mexican food. Indeed. Some kind of tapas. Exactly. But then I was. Because we were just discussing other things that upset us and like glimpses. Well, true. Obviously, war. I mean, obviously I started with war, famine, disease, sars, that sort of thing. And then, Then it came down the list to worried about people who manufacture fax machines. Why? Because the technology. Well, I mean, if you want to say you're making fax machines, you're a little company, you make fax machines. You know what a little company. All right, you're making fax machines. Are you allowed to use email? What? Like if you work for Coke, you're not allowed to drink Pepsi. It just seems like I'm. I'm assuming sales of plummeting. Now the thing is right, isn't it? Now I haven't got a fax machine. You're right, I've got email. But I much prefer a fax because you get it. It comes out the other. It comes out the other side. Yeah, but I mean, it is what they've sent. That's what's great about a fact. You can print off your email, can't you? And then you've got it. Hard copy. Wow. It's sort of instant, you know, I don't look at the emails. The fax comes out. It's. There it goes. It's like someone putting a little post now into your face, you know, I mean, you go, oh, yeah, I'll read that. Yeah. Whereas the email, you've got email. Yeah, well, yeah. No, but what worries me is whether facts. I'm assuming fax machines are just. I mean, I don't know if there's anyone listening who works maybe for a fax machine. 700, 800, 1234. If you're in the fax industry, give us a call, tell us, you know, what sort of. Sort of figures. Yeah, you know, exactly. Yeah, we want to go down 17, something like that in the Southwest. Exactly. But you got. Have you got fax machines yet in the north, Carl? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, you're loving it and. Yeah, I like getting letters. Well, no one. You like getting a scroll from A man on a horse. Yeah. When do you get letters? Just. My mum still sends me the odd letter. Sure. Even though I call, she'll still. She likes sitting down at a table and, you know. So what, you call and ask the questions, there's no reply and then you get a letter a day later. Question one. Yes, I am well. Question two. Yes, your father's well? Yeah. Oh, it's nice, though, isn't it? Yeah, that is nice. It's nice to receive a letter. Yeah, it's always nice to receive a. Letter, particularly if, like, you know, you're on a sort of expedition. What does annoy me, though? You. You were looking at them the other day, you know, you were talking about the pictures on them. Postcards. Yes. Don't like them. You don't like. You don't like postcards? No, they annoy me. Just because it's never anything of any interest. And the fact that even though it's been sent to you, you're the last one to read it. Whenever I used to see my mum, a postcard every day. Every time I send her, I'd horrify her by putting on it. Having a lovely time. Does that pig of a postman still read all your letters? And she'd just be horrified. She'd be terrified he looked at it or something. This is what worries me. I've always assumed that people would read a post. If I was a postman, I would definitely read every single postcard. So if you're on holiday. What do you mean? You wouldn't have a lot of time left if you read every postcard. No, but as you were posting, as you were posting through the letterbox, you'd have a quick look, wouldn't you, to see what they were up to. Because that's why I never used to write anything of any interest on the postcard, because I didn't want to, you know, I didn't want anyone to sort of know what I was up to. Let's say I was on a bawdy lads holiday. I would just write some nice, sunny, you know, Got myself a lovely pair of shorts. Yeah. You know, I'd keep the truth, Rick, for when I got home. Well, he's looking forward to it on holiday now, Carl, because he's got some prescription lens sunglasses. We're talking about that after the break. Look forward to that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. An amusing story about a man wearing glasses. Oh, the darkness growing on me. It certainly is an XFM 104.9, love. Those boys keep the guitar Riffs up, lads. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant. It's good to see that you're back pain has not impaired your DJing abilities. Yeah, I know, I know. Well, I'm a professional. I'm a professional. You soldiered on. Yeah. Put the glasses on for Carl. Well, she know because I wear glasses normally. I, I've always had problems with glasses. The thing about glasses is it stops you from doing so many things and you may not realize if you're a non glasses wearer, certain things that you can never do. If you're like for instance, I have never been able to volleyball. Go into the mosh pit at a gig and get carried above everyone. They carry you above everyone on their hands because I knew someone would just need to. You can see from the back. Yeah, that's a good thing about you. Being able to at least jump on the stage and do a stage dive and all the rest of it. So that's one of the things I've missed out on. Missed out on, you know, sport really, because lots. Boxing, for instance, I could never do. I never do boxing, never do wrestling. So our big championship showdown is not gonna happen. We'd probably be the same weight category. Well, possibly your reach. Yeah, exactly. I remember when I first got glasses, I. I only had to wear them occasionally. I was. I think I was. It meant I couldn't see things a long way away. And also I got them, but I was at school and I was a bit self conscious, didn't want to really tell anyone I had glasses. I just, I didn't reveal to anyone I was wearing them. So I used to go into a class. I remember being in science and we always sat in the same spot and I was sat right at the back and I couldn't see what was on the blackboard. But I didn't want to start. I don't want to put my glasses on because I didn't want people to know I had glasses. So I guess I couldn't see what was being written on the board. You have to copy stuff down from the board. Science equations, things like that. I had no idea. So I'd have to try and copy off someone next to. To me. But not. That wasn't always possible because I had to do it surreptitiously. So what I took to doing was sharpening my pencil every sort of 35 seconds, going up, memorizing what was on the board and I got a D in science. Oh, that's awful though. It's a big. It's a tough thing, glasses, when you first start wearing it for your young. It was education versus vanity. Yeah, it's terrible, isn't it? And now he's think. He thinks. Well done. He's sorted out his hair. You can see he's got stylish, stylish hair. Because when I met him, it was like. I mean, words or gummage. He won't mind me saying that. Yeah, his glasses were, I mean, idiotic when I met him. And he's got some stylish glasses now. So he sorted that out. Yeah, his clothes. He's quite a fashionable bloke. And when I first met him. So it's step by step. And with these, I think you'll agree. Pop them on Steve. Well, imagine him on the beach. Close your eyes, Carl. Are they closed? I can't see. I've taken my glasses off. So that's a weird thing as well, isn't it? There you go. What are you laughing at? Look. What are you laughing at, Carl? There's nothing funny about those. Stop smirking. I can see through. You can see they're not real sunglasses, they're prescription lenses. So he can see you now, you see? I never knew you had to do that with sunglasses. I didn't think you had to have that. Yeah. When it's bright outside, people who wear glasses don't need to wear them. So they're looking cool, but they're bumping into. No, but if your eyes aren't that good, then the sun shouldn't be bothering them. No. I always wondered about Roy Orbison. Why was he doing that? What? Roy Orbison always had shades on, didn't he? And he was blind and stuff. It's like. What? What's the point of that? Well, because I. I don't. I don't. I mean, I don't. I'm guessing. Well, I don't even want to. I don't know. What are you talking about? It's Roy. Orson was buying, wasn't he? Yeah. Was he? I thought he just had very, very bad vision. No, I think he was a blind fellow. I don't think he was blind. Was he not? No, I think he had a very poor vision. You know, I don't know what this conversation is anymore. No. Well, once again, we've introduced Carl into the equation. He's just gone off on a completely bizarre tangent. When I went, he went, oh, I can pick up my prescription lenses. And he went, we had to wait. And the bloke came and said, who's it for? Me. Oh, yeah, Mr. Mention, here they are. And as he was getting out to try and embarrass Steve, I went to him. They are the exact ones that Keanu Reeves uses in the Matrix, aren't they? What? I went, no, I'm joking, I'm joking. But I'll tell you what frustrates me. Can I just say, as a glasses wearer, and this is just a note to everyone out there who isn't a glasses wearer, when people ask constantly to try on your glasses. Can I try on your glasses? And they try them on and they always say the same thing, oh, I can't see a thing. What were you expecting? X ray vision? No. Yeah, I know. Don't ask if you're a glasses where you don't want people asking to try. But I think they don't realize that, what by going, oh, God, your eyesight's bad. Yeah. It's not like going, you know, I mean, it's not like saying, let's have a go with your calipers, right, and popping them on and going, you can't. Walk very well, isn't it? Well, yeah, but it's, it's a, it's one that doesn't impair that much. It's an inconvenience. You maybe have to put glasses on all the time. No, but it's not. Yeah, but you're not, you're not. What's your. What's your vision? It's just blurred. Is it? No, I can't see anything. It's really bad. Is it really bad? Yeah. If I take my glasses off, you are just a blur. I see now I can see nothing. It's just. Just a couple of bald heads. And I know only one of you. Is bald, so you're looking at Carl twice. Yeah, Exactly. Your vision, 2020. Well, there you go. That's Steve's Eyes on XFM next week, Ricky's knees final. Yeah. Now listen, I want to mention this. This is from this new Morrissey compilation. It's a new series, I'm assuming a number of different rock stars are gonna do it. It's called under the Influence. And various rock stars get to choose, obviously, songs which they grew up listening to and that have influenced them. And this is from Morrissey, he's the first person to do it. And there's on there, which is a bit odd and a bit oddball, and there's some stuff which is good. And there's a Ramones on there and Nico and Patty Smith. But this is one of them, obviously, famously Morrissey was a member. He was. I think he was the president of the New York Dolls fan club in England. And this is from there. This is Trash, the New York Dolls. Trash. From this new compilation under the Influence, compiled by Morrissey. Are they the original punk band? 087-008-001234 we don't. Don't call in. Don't call in, please. We're not interested. Not. No point, Rick. It's half past one. Yeah. Adverts. Yeah. Yeah. Coldplay. I'm a scientist on XFM 104.9 R. Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. We saw an interesting site on the way here, didn't we, Steve? Yeah. We can't. When we came in yesterday to. What's a plan? The show. To plan the show. Yeah. We actually annoyed Carl for half hour and left. But a bloke with a completely tattooed face. Actually, I don't know what stage you are in at. You know what stage you're at in your life when tattooing your own face. But this way, this wasn't sort of like, you know, tribal or religious. It was as a bloke just had a sort of tattoo on his forehead and around his eyes. Professionally done. It looked quite old. So I don't know. I don't know if tattoos do that now. I think they've probably got to watch themselves, but I just think there's not. Rules about what you can tattoo. I'm assuming if you're a tattooist, you can do what you want, you can tattoo anything. I wouldn't have thought. There's probably some comeback, isn't there? I mean, I certainly, you know, I think they've got to be sober. I think you've got to be over 21. I don't know, right over something. And I wouldn't have thought many tattoos would tattoo someone's face, would they? Well, I don't know if you met tattooists. I mean, I don't want to slag them off, but they. They are like, you know, I. Nor do I. They're big. Well, exactly. And they love needles. A lot of them are big, but. They do seem like they live in the periphery of society, a lot of these. But I wouldn't. I would, I wouldn't. I just wouldn't tattoo someone's face. Do you know what I mean? No. You'd wrestle a man to the ground and then hurt your back. No. You wouldn't tattoo someone. No. I know. Does everyone ever regret it? I mean, I mean, I'm sure some people regret A tattoo. Whenever someone shows me a tattoo, I go, that's brilliant. Because I can't bear to go, that's rubbish. Yeah. Yeah. I just think that because they can't change it, there's no point. Yeah. What do you think? I go, it's brilliant. Well, I read in the paper, was it a man or a woman who had. David just had Beckham on their. On their arm, just not a picture of him, but the word Beckham tattooed on their arm spelt wrong. Oh, they'd missed out the K. Or maybe they missed out the C. So it was B E, K, A M. No. Anyway, it was spelled wrong. I mean, I mean, firstly, why do you just have the name of David Beckham on your arm? Home tattoos are the best, though. That's done with a pin and a. Some ink in prison, like with skins. Yeah. It's all wonky because they've done it in a mirror. Yeah. What does that say? We'll read it to Nuck. Yeah. In the mirror. Profanity. Yeah. Have you. Would you ever toy with a tattoo? I've told you about me. My Uncle Stan before. Tattoo Stan. No, he's just covered in him. It just looks a mess, do you know, I mean, you can be wearing the best suit in the world, but you still look a scruff. Sure. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Once you have it done. Well, no, some tattoos, you know, can be quite tasteful. No, no, but he was covered. It was like, you know, cut here on his neck. It's just. Yeah. A mess. And he did a lot of his own. I've told you about him before, have I? Don't remember it. Yeah, because I was saying, if you're going to do your own, at least make sure you're a good drawer. Yes. It was just what he thought had he done. He sort of doodled snakes around. Yeah. And all his kids names on his arms and it's like. Can't you remember him? Yeah, he might have had a lot. No, he did. And do you remember even from a young age thinking, that looks rubbish? Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, it'll probably be about 60 now. Now I'd love to see what it looks like. Yeah. Now, well, just look at this. There was another. There was a story the other day in one of the magazines that I read about this. This fella who had a. Well, this would be bizarre or 14 times then. Yeah. One of the magazines you read. Yeah. So it's gonna be Stop the Spectator. No. But this fella had a big eagle put on his back. Yeah. With a snake sort of covering it and so. Such rubbish, isn't it? This, this kind of symbols of sort of life. Yeah. A snake and an eagle. Yeah. A large breasted vampire woman riding a dragon. Yeah, yeah, that. That's always a good one. But. But you know, this fellow had that and. And he had it in his will that when he dies, he wanted his son to have the skin taken off. Oh, God. I'm putting a. Put in like a little frame. Oh. Oh, God, that's. That's horrific. What's that? That's my dad's back. Yeah. Oh, are you sure? God, no, no, because I was. I read it and kind of thought. Started having sort of memories of aunt in order again. Yeah. Because she used to always like now. Antinora is the woman. She had wind for five minutes. Sure. Yeah. But she also. She used to say, oh, Carl, rub me back. Right. And with her being quite old, it was all sort of moly and warty. It was moldy. Moly, moly. Right. And what did you do? I didn't like it. I hated it. In fact, it was like reading a braille book. Yeah. It was like putting your hand in a. In a load of Cocoa pops. Oh, dear. All really big brown things. And I just thought frame framing hers would be sort of 3D is right. Was that a chunk of the moon? Did you Artex that wall? Nora's back. Oh, God. Any piece of your body can't be. That'll be fine. That's disgusting. Putting your hand into. Is she the one with the split tennis ball when she wasn't wearing knitting. No, let's not discuss the tennis ball. Okay. So she used to get you to sort of knead her doe on her back. God, this is really bad. With her dress or whatever. She wore those sort of squid looking things. That old. Sorry, sorry. What? What, what, what? Those squid looking. Hey, it's Auntie Nora covered in octopuses. What you talking about? What do you mean? It's like a nightgown type thing. But what's squid got to do with it? Because he sort of looked like a squid around the. Around the edge. Oh, I know. Frilly things. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And she just said, oh, just. Oh, I'm making. Oh, she was never. Well, she was never. Do you know? I mean, she's always had something wrong with her. I don't. I don't ask her, you know, she's not going to be all right. Did she have wind when you were sort of neat. It must have been like Playing an. Who's your auntie with the tattoos? That's. That's Hazel. All right, yeah. Let's leave that. Why? Unless. What have I come across there? What's up with Hazel? What's up with Annie? Hazel? There's nothing wrong with her. Just a. What? Just a lesbian. Which is nothing wrong with that. Well, no, but you've made it sound like there is now, but not wanting to say it. My aunt is a lesbian. I know what you're saying, though. I know what you're getting at. Just because I call her Uncle A's play a record. He's from Manchester. Please, please forgive him. Lizzie, don't believe a word. XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky James, with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Email here from Chris. He said you met a girl in Australia whose boyfriend tattooed her arm with the word psycho, except the spelling was wrong and she ended up scarred for life with the word physco. Fizzco. P H Y S C O. A word of warning. If you're going out today to get a tattoo, they're tattooists. English is probably not their specialty, so be careful. Write it down for the. Nice. I've seen some of these boys. They're big. They're big. And if they're willing to stick lumps of metal through their faces, what are they going to do to you? Well, yeah, indeed. So. So, yeah, Steve, sorry. I have a weird problem with the piercing as well, because, I mean, the earrings. That makes sense. I had earrings ages ago, but. Did you? Yeah. And he's scared of everything. Yeah. I was about 18, I had two and one. And they did it right. And he's went. And I went, all right. I went, yeah. I just went, oh, God, yeah. Did you have them in both earrings? It's just. It just. It was like a staple guys went through. Yeah. Yeah. And. Yeah. And it didn't really hurt. I thought, well, I'm not doing that again. It hurts too much. And it just throbbed. Were you still living with your. Your parents at the time? No. I mean, what? No, you're kind of oiki reading family. What would they have made of. Oh, well, they know I had them afterwards. Yeah, but did they take the mick? Oh, God, of course they did. Yeah. Yeah. You ain't going eight like that. Oh, you'll get followed. Oh, look at you. Look at that. Yeah. That's disgusting. And I was. No one else knew about. My mom said, bloody hell, I thought I only had one girl. Which is the earring. Because isn't it? Like one ear is for gay people and one is for straight people. Is that just a myth or. I don't know. It might. Something to do with which. Yeah. There probably was sort of like signs for that. Yeah. It's like when you're growing up, I had loads. Like a white polar neck. Right. And a. And a ring on your little finger. That means you're gay. Yeah, yeah. You can see him coming. He's just consulting your little chart. Exactly. One polar neck, earrings in the left ear. I got. I don't know where I am. Wasn't there that thing that. That. The famous cover of Bournemouth. Bruce Springsteen. Yeah. Know the handkerchief. Yeah. In the right hand pocket, dominant and was. Yeah. I don't know. But you know, when. Where is this information? I wouldn't have known that. I might have gone around, you know, with, you know, if it was hot weather, something to mop my brow. I wouldn't have known that. What? Can't the gay people kind of notify us? Can we have some kind of website or something? Do you still go to that pub with all those sort of like butch blokes with the mustaches and great guys? A lot of them are firemen. A lot of them are like traffic co. Great people. You know what I mean? You know, you're safe in there. There's no women to. It's like you're just having a great time with the lads and there's nothing. It's playing pool. Strip to your waist. Yeah, I can talk. Oh, my back's glare. Okay. Yeah. A little bit of hip hop. It's nice to have occasional hip hop tune. Just keep it, you know, say, summer, you'll be cruising around in your open top Chevy. Now, Steve, I see there it's a track by Little Kim, but how are you pronouncing it? I'm pronouncing that correctly. Lil Kim. Oh, no teas involved. And it's the jump off featuring Mr. Cheeks. I don't know why I find that funny. Mr. Cheeks is involved, if you can spot him. Good luck, Lil Kim. And I believe that's Mr. Cheeks there. Just. Just busted it on the mic. And that's called the Jump off. Talking of Cheeks, Carl, have we got another installment of Cheeky Freak of the week this week? Yeah. Have we? Excellent. Look forward to that. Is there some monkey news? Goes without saying, of course. Really with that. Monkey news is safe, isn't it? It's not like you're always going home. With monkey news, you know, it's there, yeah. It's like Songs of Praise on the. Sunday when I came back on holiday for a week and I sort of sat in by the pool and stuff and I sort of wrote about 40 minute stand up with a new. My new show and I was going to call, I said, it's great when you get away. Sort of like you're relaxing, you just. You just think clearly. I know, I know, I know, I know. He said I was away when I came up with Rockbusters. Yeah, indeed. Absolutely. I was buzzing about writing 40 minutes of brand new stand up. Yeah, he equated that to coming up with Rockbusters. Should I be insulted, Steve, or is Rockbusters as good as everyone's saying it is? Is it. Is it the one good idea? Is it like emc e equals MC squared? Was to. Einstein is to. You know, Rockbusters is to. Carl. What if I do this, Rick? What if we. If I played you some adverts right now and then we came back with some Rockbusters? Yeah, you could, you could make the job. Maybe I'll do Rockbusters and show people how easy it is to do it. Wrong adverts then. Rockbusters and a cup of lovely coffee. Cup of coffee in the coffee. I want a cup of coffee. Placebo. This picture. Xfm. What's Carl doing? What's he rooting around? But listen, while he's doing that, can I just say happy birthday from all of us to Shan.

Did you get up today and just see the great weather and think, you know what? I'd love to hear some Stir it up from Bob Marley. Yeah, I did, actually. Well, I was going to play it last. The week before last, before I went away and we didn't. We didn't have time, so. Well, we were crammed full of features like this one. Have we got a Cheeky Freak of the Week? Do you want one? Yeah, yeah. I think we should have a jingle for this. Okay. I've got. I've. Yeah, I've got a jingle. It's very similar to Chimpanzee. Chimpanzee that. Well, let's hear it. Let's hear it. Okay. Oh, Cheeky Freak of the Week. Brilliant. Brilliant. Yeah. No, I think that's excellent. So just a freak of the week you've spotted. This is where. This is where somewhat, I think, offensively, you pick on someone who's. Who's not like other people and say it's your favorite freak of that week. I remember we had the woman whose legs look like the hind legs of a dog. Dog. We've had the little fella with the aging disease with a little head playing the piano. That's. That was your favorite, I think that's your. Probably freak of the year, isn't it? It's a pretty good one. So what's this? Is it a man with a horrendous injury, or is it a congenital birth defect or what? Yeah, but you put it like that and now it sounds like I'm being tight, sounds like I'm being out of order, but I'm just giving him a. Mention, just giving them a big shout out. There's quite a lot going on in the freak world. There always is. What, have you been visiting hospitals the last week? Have you, when we were away? No, there was. There's a thing on the. On a website. This isn't even the one that I've picked, so. So this is just a bonus. This is a bonus. Yeah, yeah, go on in. This is a free freak. It's a fella called the Lobster Man. The Lobster man, of course, again, good name. You know what you're gonna get. Yeah. What are you gon. Yeah, some succulent. I like the idea. I like the idea that the vicar on the christening suggested that. I don't want to call him Mark. Can I make a suggestion? What's his name? Mark Michael Webster. Right, right, yeah. Have I thought about nicknames? Not really, no. Have you? Yeah, we don't want to talk about that because. Well, yeah, but it's quite deformed. It's like, you know, we. Can I suggest Lobsterman. That's terrible. Vicar. That is terrible. Vicar. Go on, then. We're gonna see. This is what the sort of feature you come up with, Carl. So Lobster Man. There's probably people listening now with, you know, lobster feet, lobster hands. So Squid Boy. So Lobster man, what does. What does Lobster man do? Does he fight crime? Not that much. Apparently he got into a bit of trouble. He was in a restaurant, and this was years ago, by the way, and. Someone picked him to eat him. No, apparently the waiter said, oh, you shouldn't be sat here. You should be in my pan or something. Oh, dear. And it. They had a fight, got out of hand. Yeah. Got out of claw and. Yeah. Yeah. So that was a fight. I mean, what did he do? A waiter took the mickey out of someone with. With. Can I just make clear. I'm assuming it's his hands look a bit like those of a lobster. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that is fused. So it's just like two big fingers. They're fused, I assume, probably in the womb. And they're just like. Instead of, like, having five digits, they're fused and he. But he can pick stuff up, can't he? Yeah. What does he pick up? He mainly eats grubs and jellyfish, doesn't he? Yeah. Yeah. So he was having a fight with the waiter. He snipped off his nose. So anyway, he just held on to the waiter's bib. Yeah. And the waiter was screaming, going, get him off me. Yeah. Does he eat other lobsters? Do you think you would eat lobster or is it kind of. Would you feel bad about eating lobster? Right. The little cheek of the freak that we've gone for anyway. The what? The little freak of the week. Cheeky freak of the week. We've gone for this Siamese lad. Okay. Right. Happened back in. You can't have a Siamese lad, can you? All right. Yeah. Siamese twins. Happened back in 1693. Oh, he's got a date blindness. First time ever. Yeah. And all it was. It was. He was doing all right for himself. He used to go on there, like those circus things he used to do. They're two people. You're talking about Carl. So we're going to him. All right, then. All right. They. They. They did this circus show, right. And everything's going well. You know, they're selling out the tents and stuff, people coming to see them. Yeah, he was doing all right for himself. Yeah. Right. Sorry, before I said that, did you think a Siamese twin was a man with two heads? Well, it can be, can't it? It depends. There are two people. They're conjoined. No, no, no. But it depends on it. The one that I shown you in that book that time was a fellow with Tourette's. No, it wasn't. That was. That was a. It was a. A stupid picture in one of your stupid books that he had a growth that looked a little bit like it had a face on. Wasn't a man with two heads. You're the same sort of people who send potato chips to Esther Anson and say, doesn't it look like Norman Cook? Yeah. It's not two heads. We'll bend this feature. No, no, it's they're two people. They're two people. Conjoined twins. Right. So these just, they just happen to have a similar taste in clothes. Okay. Anyway, so, yeah, they were doing all right and it all went wrong when he crossed the road, got run over. The lad with two heads got run over. That's it. What? How is that. How is that Jiggy freak of the week. Just because. Just because it got my interest and I kind of thought, why don't you just look both ways? I'm intrigued to know why wasn't he looking both ways? I'm intrigued to know how you. How you get run over and what was it, 16, 29? Yeah, well it's horses and that on it. Yeah. Oh, why wasn't he looking both ways? Carl. Carl Pilkington, you are a genius. Play a record, you fool. Well done, Carl. More Cheeky freak of the week next week. See what's going on. Universally smart speaking. Red Hot Chili peppers and XFM 104.9. So got a lot of Rockbusters coming in. Yeah, all right. Actually, people obviously seemed at long last to have tuned into your wavelength, Carl, which is of course 104.9. Yeah, thanks very much. Exactly, yeah. Should we give the clues again briefly? We just had an email actually, to. Be honest with you. Let's not because we've already had a load of answers so, you know, if you didn't get it first time around, you don't deserve it to win. We had an email saying, cuz I've got a bad back. Am I squeezing Carl's head? Well I've already had a little squeeze, didn't I, about half hour ago, didn't I? Yeah, you just got to be careful cuz I don't, I don't want any strain. So I say keep still whatever happens. And he's. You're right, right there. Could I ever squeeze? You know, just as well you're not really kind of capable. He's allowed to squeeze it, isn't he? Cuz I've never, I've never squeezed it once. Remember, sideways temples go quite hard, but not too hard, front to back. Go as hard as you like, cuz that's all right. Well I'll just have a try now. Oh no, you got a book out it. He sorted it out. He says every Saturday I'm taking over from him. Let him, let him have one squeeze. Let him, let one have a go then. So at the, the front and the back. Yeah, no, get round, get round. So you got. That's it. Right. Now use your. Use the thing. Not too hard at the front. No, really hard at the front and back. There you go. Yeah, you got the ang of it. Oh, God. It's good fun. I. You like it? Side just. I just green fun. Yeah, it's great. You know, there's a little bit of, you know, grip there with the. The short hair, but obviously not too much. There's not much up there up top. Good, isn't it? Yeah. I'll be doing that again next week. Do you know I got a form. Right. You know I'm staff here, right. I'm. I'm like on the staff on. One of the staff. Got some internal mail the other day that you have to fill out about if you die at work, who gets your money? He said, do you put yourself at any danger? What, what did you say? Well, I asked Suzanne, I said, does that. You know. But my leg lock around your ribs that time? And I. I had. It was like. Like a little alligator. Like a python. An alligator, didn't I. You get quite some, you know, get a little bit of leverage. You can crush a man's ribs with it. Yeah. With mighty legs. Oh, something I want to ask you, Carl. I. There's that program on now. I forget what it's called. Is it something like Guess who's coming into dinner does that? I did the non broadcast pilot for that because my mate was the. Well, you know, the Phil Boker was, you know. And the premise of it is that it's. It's one of those things about, you know, a conversation piece. The ultimate dinner party. I think you can have six. Invite six guests, dead, alive or fictional. Or fictional. Yeah. And you know, you choose where you want it and. Yeah. And anyway, I was just intrigued to know what. Carl's ultimate dinner party. Who would pop round any of your cheeky free weeks? So what's this? I'm putting on a. You're putting on an imaginary dinner party and Robinson's there. She's got to be there. I said, I didn't invite you. She said, well, I'm there. Anyway. So it was actually me and Robinson and six people. Yeah. And I chose people like heroes like Muhammad Ali, Homer Simpson or stuff like that. You know, James, Randy. Yeah. So you could use it. Anyone living fictional or otherwise. Would it. Would it. Would it look like a circus from the 18th century? I'll have like a few freaks in there. Like what? Who would you have? Well, the first person I'd have is probably. Probably have Elvis. I had Elvis. I chose Elvis. Why Would you have Elvis? It's just good one. He was good at what he did. But once you'd said that to him, what would the rest of say? Sing us a song. Right. So you make him sing a song. Yeah, he'd be like the entertainment for the night when he's not on the stage performing. I probably have the Elephant man there. So. John Merrick. Yeah, yeah, John Merrick. Okay, I've got Elvis. John, if anyone's out there and you know, you have anything to do, can you write down everything Carl says from now to a year and send it to me and Steve? Because you might want to put it in a book. Yes. Is that, is that. Would that be good? Just maybe someone keep a journal of everything Carl doesn't says. I'm gonna try and keep a scrapbook of pictures. Tell you. I would have Peter Car K. Right. He'd be good. He'd be brilliant. I. I might be sat next to him. Cuz he's. Well, I mean, you're friends with Ricky. Why would you want to? No, but do you know what I mean? Yeah. Peter K. All right, which one, which one would you do him as himself or one of his characters? He does just as he is. It's funny. He's a funny man. Yeah, love him. What else? Probably that. That fell who lost his arm when he was climbing that mountain. Hunting. Remember he had to cut it off. A few weeks ago. Yeah. Why would you have him? I just. I'd just like to have a chat with him and say, you know, what happened there then. Yeah, well, we know what happened there. He cut his arm off. What would you say? Did it hurt? Yes, it hurt, but I don't think it would hurt. That's one of the questions. What are you talking about? I reckon the shock canceled any pain out. If you're stuck there with a boulder on your arm, you've probably got bad pins and needles, right? Yeah. With a big rock on your arm and you'd say, right. So how long were you sat there before you said, well, I've got to cut this off. Did you read about it? It was amazing. What do you think the other people would be doing when you were talking about exploit, about cutting his own art. John Merrick wouldn't mind. Albus would probably be off his head on summer. Elephant man will be having a couple of bums. I hope Peter K didn't make a funny comment. I hope he doesn't make a funny comment. Yeah, right. Can I just a quick one. I'll just put bloke with. Bloke with one arm. Bloke with. Be careful car. What you serve for dinner. Yeah. Because he's only got one arm. So you know, certain things. I mean, maybe suggest something you can. Eat with chopsticks or a hamburger. A hamburger. But don't go with something like lobster. Tricky. You need both hands for that. Unless him and John Merrick teamed up. I think they've got one good arm each. Yeah. Soup maybe. What would you give John Merrick? Buns. Couple of. Yeah, a couple of buns. That woman, that woman in the boat who went around the world. Why? To see, you know what, how she manage. Boring guests, really. Hey, but boring? What do you mean boring? She going to say what she said she was going. Well, I didn't see a lot. I was in a cabin really. It was a lot of water. A lot of water. I was a bit scared. The main thing I'd want to ask her. Right. Cuz I remember when she did it and there was an interview with her and her parents were there as well and a man was saying, now she's dead proud because she. She decided to, you know, go around the world in a boat as a kid instead of just hanging around on street corners and stuff. She said didn't she didn't want her daughter to like be messing about on the streets at night on her own and stuff. She was a responsible mother. Yeah. And she sent her off on a boat. Sure. In the middle of the Atlantic on her own. Yeah. So I'd like to ask her about. I think even Manchester's safer than that, innit? Yeah. And I'd have probably another woman. So to chat to her. Probably go for Kim Marsh. Kim Marsh. Sorry, sorry. You'd have the woman who sailed around the world. Right. But you'd have to have another woman for her to have someone to talk to. Well, why invite either of them then if you don't want to talk to either of them yourself? What? Sorry. I love this. Round the world yachts woman. Round world Y. And Kim Marsh. But why? Of all the women you could invite, Kim is at the top. No, that's the best list I've ever heard. Heard Elvis, John Merrick, Peter K. A bloke with one arm. The round the world yachts woman chatting to Kim Marsh. That is genius. Why haven't they invited you on this show? I'm gonna call Anne Robinson. Right. Okay. If anyone's listening to that, have Carl Pilkington. I know. No one knows who he is yet, but what a great bit of conversation. Play A record car. You're an idiot. Oh, always a treat. Yeah, we played some. Something from Morris's selection. Something that would be a mildimate compilation is something from the Smiths. And it'll probably be this one I started Something I couldn't finish. I think that's one of their underrated albums. Rick Strangeways, here We Come. It might be my favorite. It's my favorite, certainly. And that's from the album. Queen of Death is a lot of people's favorite, but I don't like the wacky ones. It's the novelty ones. He's got some great ones. I think he's got some of his best tunes on there. But I don't know the. Frankly, Mr. Shank. Yeah, he's always got this. This tendency to sort of write music. Music hall style song. But that's a great one, that. So there you go. Elvis, John Merrick, Peter K. Bloke with one Arm. Woman who Sailed around the World. Kim Marsh. What I like about those two number numbers, 4 and 5, he doesn't even know their names. Yeah. I'm hoping he'll just write on the invitation. Yeah. Having a dinner party. Yeah. It's better than most. But I imagine most people, when they do as if they go, nelson Mandela. I know, of course. Yeah. I think I read an interview with Mick Hucknell where it was something like, who. Who do you admire? Nelson Mandela. Brilliant. I was really. I don't read papers when I'm in this country. When I was on holiday, I read one. There was an article in there about Beckham meeting him. And the article was about how many people have met him. And I was thinking, we are the only three people that haven't met him. Nelson Mandela. Yeah. It's just like. Does he rent himself out? Do you know what I mean? It's like the back of the. You know, the back of the stage where you can get a caprice lookalike to wander around. They go, is that a lookalike? No, that's really him. Yeah. 40 quid. He'll come to your party. I think what it is is that he was loc for so long. Yeah. He's. Now he's a socialist. He's like salmon rusty. He's running around. I've seen him twice. Yeah. His house must be a tip. He's never in. God. Well, I think it is. If you. If you. If you stay indoors for a long time. Yeah. You've got to get out there. You gotta get out. You get a bit stir crazy, I. Suppose, but yes, Mate, he's met some of the great names in world events. He's met the Spice Girls. Alan Titchmarsh. Yeah, they did his garden, didn't they? Yeah. David Mickle. Yeah. Oh, that must have been great. But, I mean, maybe we could hold out and never meet him. Yeah, that's his idea. Even if we get invited, you want to be elsewhere, like I. No. Yeah, not really. We're the only three people who've never met Nelson Mandela. I'm not meeting him, so I make sure he's definitely going straight. Yeah. I mean, I don't care. I don't like to hang out with people. No, I wouldn't invite him to my ultimate dinner party, in case, you know, the silverware went missing. Well, you don't know. He was inside for a long time. You know, they pick up things in these places. You can pick stuff up. It's usually Carl that comes out with those sort of things. Carl, what do you think of that? Well, Nelson not having him around because he's nicking. Well, let's back out now. Let's back out now while we're ahead. We couldn't. Celebrity Big Brother. Yeah. Being used to being locked up and that. Yeah, I started something I couldn't finish. Yeah, let's. Should we play another record or should we talk about some on a lighter note, Muffy the Hamster had a narrow escape with it. Play us on. Let's have a rock. Walking down the street can't see their faces but I've noticed. Martina Topley, Bird. Need one. All right. XFM 104.9. Well, it's that time. It's getting exciting. We've got Rockbusters results. But before that, a little bit of monkey news with. Oh, chimpanzee that. Monkey news. Brilliant. Nice to have out with that for a couple of weeks. Go on in. All right. So is that this little monkey? Oh, yeah. It lives in Morocco. Right. You. I'll just warn you now, you're on thin ice from last time, okay? So make sure. Is this real? It's been. Think about as you're saying it, think to yourself, is that true? Do monkeys do that? Do they think like that? So then. So anyway, yeah, so there's this magician in Morocco, right? He's got a little monkey working. Working with him, right? The way it used to work. Magician used to do his thing on stage, do a little bit of magic. People loved it. Then the monkey came out, had a little cap, walked around the crowd and stuff, got the money, had a good little team thing. Going on. Right, yeah. So anyway, the Monkey's name was 86, right. Because back then there was so many monkeys, it was like, oh, what names? Do you know what I mean? What names? Right, so this, this little monkey. Well, he had. He had 86 monk. Other monkeys. No, no, it's just that. Because a lot of monkeys were sort of working back then, helping magicians out, you know, doing bits and pieces, busking, what have you. You know how there's something. Why would there be a confusion with that if he only had one monkey? Where's the confusion? People would go, I'm not gonna go and see that. I want to see 86. He's the better monkey. A monkey. Do you know what I mean? What does it matter? I don't know what you mean. Well, why do they need. Where was the confusion with people going to the circus and going, what monkey can they see tonight? I don't know. It wasn't a billing, was it, with a monkey? But, Ricky, it's just the same with humans, you know, there's so many humans now that we can't give them names anymore. Yeah, numbers, exactly. Yeah. There's so many humans, you know, with 5 billion people, like, we can't give them names, it's impossible. But, you know, with a few months. Go on. So anyway, so There he is, 86. 86, with his art, walking around, getting the money. Yeah. Anyway, the magician sort of, you know, thinking about moving on, because in Morocco he'd sort of done all the tourist traps. Sure. So he had a word with the monkey, said, how about we see. No, let him continue. Think he let him continue. He didn't have a word with the monkey. Let him continue. So what do you think about going over to spell pain? Yes, sure. So the monkey was in agreement, so. He said, I go on then. Right. So. So they get in the car and like, the magician knew he'd have a bit of a problem on his arms because you're not meant to take monkeys out of the country. Yeah, right. So he thought, right, what I'll do, I'll. I'll get a car, right? Right. Uh, stick the monkey in a boot, right. Uh, get on the boat and hopefully sort of, you know, stick it in some luggage and what have you. Yeah, we'll be over there, we'll be earning big money, everything's gonna be great. So the monkey was like, brilliant. So they. They get in the car, they're on the way to the. To the boat and pull over at a petrol station. And just before filling up, he Opens up the boot and he goes, you all right? And then it's like. Yeah, yeah. It leaves the boot open so it can breathe and get a bit of fresh air whilst it's filling up. Goes in to pay the money. Yep, pays the money. Goes. I'm just paying for the. Right, this monkey is not going to drive away in that car. Car or we're never doing this feature again. Carl, what happens? What's number 86 up to? 86. So that's the ending, isn't it? That's the story. Come on, let's finish. Brilliant. You're gonna love it. Right, so he's in the petrol station and he's going, right, I'll pay for pump four. And the fellow says, what are you. Talking about, Pump 4? Isn't that a monkey? No, sometimes I use numbers for monkeys. Sometimes I use. No, I mean pump four. Sure. So he says what you're talking about. There's no car at pump four. Right, Keep going. Sticks his head out of the door. The monkey's giving it some. Went over to Spain on its own. I don't know what to do. Hang on, let's just. Let's just get a couple of the facts right here. What do you mean, couple of the facts? Right, there are no facts. So number 86. Number 86. He drove to Spain. You are honestly, Carl, you must know. It was an automatic. Right? How did he. You must know that is. There is no way a monkey. That's the thing with this Customs mental. How would he get through Customs? Carl? No, he was sneaking about because he didn't have a passport, so he parked. And then snuck through. John, the fax. Let me see it. Right, I'll examine this, Rick, and we'll play a record. Because I can't. That's. That's nearly as bad as the armed robbery. Robbery. Right, go on, play record. Better Suede. Yeah, Stay Together. My favorite. One of 86's favorites. Yeah, brilliant. My favorite suede track. No, Stay Together. Excellent fm. Well, nearly time to go, but before we do a little bit of Rock Buster results. Just checking some of the answers, Rick, and it seems that an awful lot of people have got it right. Go on, then, tell us them again, then. Remind us of them before you give us the answers. All right. Rockbusters Number one was like this. It was a couple. We're stopping Monkey news, by the way, until you start getting some credible ones. Because it. Because that's ridiculous. Ridiculous. It's not true. It seems. Seems mad, but. No, but it's for The Internet again. So anyone. Anyone can go online, download that story. Story. It's insubstantial. It's. Get ones. Get ones from journals or where the source is quoted. Okay. Or we're not interested. Or we're not. Well, you don't. Okay, so same with On Thin Ice. We've pulled this once, we've pulled rock, but we suspended it once, and you came back again. So it's. Do you know what I mean? So go on, then. Right, so, Rockbusters. Rockbusters Number one was about a customer who wanted some paint, wanted to darken up a room. The shop assistant knew what to do. What did she do? The initials were CB Seller, Black. Right. Seller, black. Sell us some black. See, I thought Cilla black. Because it's CB And I thought, well, it can't be, because it's not seller. It's not sell her black. It's cryptic, though, isn't it? No, no. Cryptic doesn't mean it's wrong. They all got it, and they all got it anyway, so. It's a bit weird, isn't it? Second one. It would be all right if the reds weren't that big. Right, Right. The initials are S.F. Well, one of my favorite bands. Yeah, yeah. The. The smaller faces, isn't it Small Faces? Well, no, that doesn't make sense. Okay, go on, then. And the final one. Chanel, have got another perfume out. I'll just say we've had an email from one of our listeners who said if this turns out to be New Order, he's never listening to XFM again. What's the color again? Chanel. I've got another perfume out. New odor. Right, well, that's another list of Go. What do you mean there's not a group called New Oda? No, it's cryptic. It's not. That doesn't mean crypto. Cryptic. Wrong. Doesn't mean cryptic. It's like saying, what animal? I thinking of frog. That doesn't mean cryptic. Sell her black. What artist is that? Small Faces works just about. If I say, what animal? I'm thinking of monkey. Well, there you go then. So it does work. Play a record. Play a record. So who's a winner? Ah, yes. Now I'm gonna give it to someone who emailed him with the correct answer. And his name is Steve Martin. Martin, really? And I've given you. I don't know if you noticed, over the last few weeks, I've been given the prize to people with just a kooky element to them, you know, if. They'Ve got people Sending their name in like Barry Bumpfroid. Well, don't worry because I can spot if it's a fake comedy name. What was that last one we laughed at? Gerald something. Yeah, it was. It was like Gerald Smithers Preston. Gerald Preston. Why is that funny name? Jerry Preston. A great guy, but Jerry Preston. We laughed at that. He caught me at attention. So this week Steve Martin's caught my attention. Right. Yeah. When was the last time Steve Martin made you laugh? This Steve Martin. Dickers hasn't been. Yeah. We've had no correspondence from Dickie Anderson for some time, which saddens me. Little Dick Meister General. What is he doing out there? Has he got what he's got? Like he's got something better to do? Ridiculous. Right, well, so that's the end there. We've got the last song. So is there anything. It's the end of Rockbusters and it's the end of Monkey News. Monkey News will give you one more go for. It's got to credible, it's got to be real, it's got to be true. We need to see your sources. It needs to be incorporated. Okay. Rockbusters. They've got to be real band names. New Odor. New Odor. New Odor. Just anything. Just brilliant. Well done to Steve. He got them all. So. So is that it then? Yeah. Brilliant. Well, cheers. I've enjoyed that. I hope your back's better, Rick. Yeah. And Carl, I hope you buck up your ideas. Your brain's better. Yeah. Got something interesting about a brain. We can talk about it next. No, tell it now. No, quickly. What is it? No, I'll leave it. Oh, like that's a hook. Like people going to be going for a week. Wonder what things have a Carl's brain. Was it a brain that drove a motorbike across to Switzerland? You've heard it. We passed upon the stairs.",
