We're with our producer here, Carl Pilton. We'll be talking to Carl a little bit later because we've got to have his thoughts on Aesop's Fables continually. The Education of. Of Car. We've got some great music coming up. Plenty of good music. Little bit of. Oh, what we got. Happy Mondays. Yeah, all that. Bob Dylan. All sorts. All sorts coming up. Yeah. Rick, I don't know, I just wanted to bring your attention to this. Someone passed this on to me. It's from the Guardians media website that has a sort of website that's dedicated to kind of media information about our complaint. Well, the headline is Comedian rapped over Radio Innuendo. Right. Jessica Hodgson has written the article. Are you familiar with this? Well, be careful now because we actually got a complaint. A lot of people don't know this. We got a complaint upheld and all. Of this is it. We're very sorry. We didn't mean to offend and it was a while ago, so we are gonna be very careful. Carl's getting very nervous. We're just gonna read out. We're not gonna editorialize, Kyle. We're just gonna read out what the Guardian printed about us. All right? Okay. Comedian Ricky Gervais has had a dressing down from a broadcasting watchdog for his repeated use of the word cock in a lunchtime radio show. That's all right. That's what it says. He's not gonna say it again. Imagine this is the news and I'm reading it. Yeah. The Broadcasting Standards Commission upheld a complaint against the comedian for coarse sexual in the program on London station xfm. The commission acknowledged that the presenter's remarks were intended to be humorous, but took the view that the amount and detail of the corsicial innuendo had exceeded acceptable boundaries for broadcast, said the BSC in a statement. The complaint objected to a section in the Comics Saturday afternoon show when he discussed the different meanings of the word. Gervais wondered aloud whether the word was acceptable when discussing birds, but not the male sexual organ. A BSC spokesman said the comedian went on and on about it for nearly five minutes. Xfm, a self styled alternative radio station station, said in its defense that its remit was to provide cutting edge programs for a youth audience. The station said the program's brief was to include elements of alternative comedy within certain shows that would not fit within a more mainstream radio station format. In this particular show, it was not the presenter's intention to shock when they took a humorous look at how the English language could be construed in different ways within different contexts. Gervais, whose big break was on telephone's 11 o'clock show, has shot to household status through the portrayal of David Brent, the middle manager from hell, in BBC2's cult show the Office. Just in case you didn't know, I was talking. Talking about. He's a household name. Yeah. They just thought you might not have heard of him. But he is a household name. Now, that. That's good. That's good reporting and they're quite right about it. And I just remind people it was when Steve said, the only bird that hasn't got a penis is the swan, and I went on about the male bird being called the. But I couldn't use that to mean. And, you know, it was. It was childish. But what. What annoys me is I'm sure I've heard things on, like, Radio one like that. Oh, what's the. The what's her name in the morning? Sarah Cox. Yeah. And as there's a DJ like Carl Cox. Yeah. So you got Carl. What's the matter? I'm just saying. You just say there's a pair of DJs on. We haven't done this. And. What are you talking about? We're just talking about names. They're just saying the names now. I love Cox in the morning. You're a big fan. You're a big fan of Cox and at night. What's the matter with you? Come on, Carl. All right, we've taken it. We've been. Have you actually been wrapped over this? No. I don't know. Have you had a dressing down? When did that happen? I don't know. I meant to tell you and I never got around to it. Okay, thanks, then. So don't do it again. Kinky afro on XFM 104.9. Could I just add that in case you don't know what. What you know the frequency is? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Why do they say that? Are they not so you know what you listen to? So you go, I'll tell you what, I like that radio station. Yeah. And it was XFM 104.9. I listened to that again. Listen to that. You can retune. Yeah. I was wondering actually. Stay locked up this end of the dial. True enough. I was wondering because, you know, obviously we're still trying to campaign to get Carl into Air. Into the air. Yeah, with the balloon enterprise. And obviously the work's been done on that. Don't fret. Don't worry. A lot people are asking for an update, but, you know, we'll obviously let you know when it's all going to take place. Yeah, but I was wondering whether things take time. Exactly. But I was wondering whether we should also. Also have another kind of campaign. Some kind of campaign, maybe one that could involve you, Rick, because I'm obviously. No, I'm particularly concerned. I don't know how familiar you are with this, with Ricky's eating habits, because he just. He eats so unhealthily. No, excuse me. No, come on, Rick, don't give me this. You're not getting better. I have a smoothie every day. Yeah, but I've told you before, that's largely sugar. No homemade one. I don't care. Rick, that's not enough. It can't counteract, right? This is idea. This is Ricky Joyce's idea of healthy eating, right? We'll be in the canteen at the BBC. It'll go, I'm going to be eat healthy today. Which means he'll have two slices of pizza instead of pizza and chips. That's basically. That's his theory, right? And it's like, it's. I don't know why. Because he can't eat anything, which is kind of. Which doesn't. Is basically doesn't sting the roof of his mouth with flavor. So, like, for instance, he's always got headaches. He's always kind of got a headache. I guess because you don't. You just drink coffee and Coke. You never drink water. Your body is dehydrated. And I said, drink a glass of water. No. Boring. It's boring. Boring. I don't know. If we were in the desert, stranded, boring. It's boring, Steve. I'll wait till the next cafe and sometimes he'll go like, oh, we'll have a. Let's have a. I'll have a salad, right? He'll get like a feta cheese salad, right? And he'll eat the little bits of feta cheese, leave the salad. Then he goes downstairs and goes, I'm still hungry. It didn't fill me up, that salad. I go, no, what didn't fill you up was the 200 milligrams of goat cheese that you ate. That's what didn't fill you up. So I just. This should be a campaign. I don't know whether it. I can observe it. People could sponsor him, something. Just eat healthy. We could do it for some kind of charity. I don't think the fruit's the issue. If you mash it, I'll eat anything. I'm not saying that you don't eat certain amount of fruit. I'm saying that everything else you eat is unbalanced and it's just rich with fat and it's awful. It's sausages, it's beans. You're such a working class guy. It's the smell of chip fat. It's all around him. Do you know what I mean? It's like even when you can't smell it, you know it's there seeping through his veins. I imagine when he was growing up, it was just chip fat in the house. Just a big. It was constantly boiling. It always. There was always chips on with everything. Yeah. Do you want Weetabix in the morning? Deep fat fry? That's. It's such scum. And now it's like, oh, yeah, my palate, you know, I can't eat anything. It's got no flavor. Everything's got cheese on it. Sprinkling Parmesan cheese. More Parmesan cheese. And if someone like doesn't give him like a whole tub of Parmesan cheese when you're in a restaurant, even though he's ordered like a lobster or whatever, he's like, he sort of has a go at the waiter or like not, not to their face, obviously. He's too much of a coward. But he'll say to me like, he didn't reach and left the cheese. He said he'll cheat with the cheese. They don't give me any cheese. He just gave you three bucketfuls. It's a cheese. I said, more cheese here. It's pathetic. So I just think we should do something to it because I'm panicked. I'm worri. I started working out a little bit. I sort of work out twice or three times. I don't think that's going to counteract it. Rick and I drink water through the night when I wake up dehydrated from. All the booze you've just drunk. Yeah. And. And I have a smoothie in the morning, don't I? I don't. I. You know what my views are on the smoothies. I don't think that's counteracting smoothie. You are smoothie. I don't think it's counteracting all the other. You've got a problem. Nothing wrong with the smoothie, right? Fine. Okay. Well, if you, if you, if you're happy to carry on as you are. Yeah, go on. Badly Drawn Boy, obviously has done the soundtrack of this new film about a boy. Yeah. Which has got Hugh Grant in it. And obviously this current single. What's it called? The current one that's out. The Silent side that's coming. Obviously that's being played on xfm, but this is another track from this album which is the soundtrack. Lots of kind of little bits of filler, bits of musical instrumental stuff, but all of it's very nice. This is a cracking tune. Track three, Something To Talk About. Lovely. Yeah, good tune. Now, I think Sarah and Lauren have emailed him. They said they wanted something from Elliot Smith or maybe Jimmy Webb. That's actually produced by the producer of Elliot Smith, Jimmy Webbing today. No, maybe play that next time. I'll play some. Yeah, next week. That's Badly Drawn Boy, though, from the soundtrack to this film about a boy. And that's called Something to Talk About. We've only got the stuff in the library. Do they want Four Non Blondes? Because we've got that in the library, haven't we? The best of Tony Basil. And we've got just about every song in Exc recorded. We don't play nothing excessive. I don't think we do. I can't believe it. XFM 104.9 coming up. White Van Man. White Van Carl. White Van Carl, who was obviously out with Carl last night. Oh, yeah. I realize this because we went out. There's. What's the name of that evening? Marketplace. Extracurricular. Extracurricular, yeah. Various XFM DJs go down there and just play an eclectic mix. Spin some tunes or. Absolutely. I'm thinking of doing it in a couple of weeks, Rick. And obviously, you know, my turntableist skills now are pretty something to behold. Yeah, yeah. And I'll tell you this. What? I did an amazing mix of the day with my friend Dan. We did. We spent two and a half hours on it. This is how we spend our evenings now. Two and a half hours. Mixing from a trip hop sort of art, you know, hip hop style. Beat into Arthur's Theme by Christopher Cross. Great. When you get called between the Moon and New Year by four people. Four people. Carol Bayer, Sega, Christopher Cross and a fourth one Phone in. If you know that. Maybe we should. But who knows? The fourth person credited on that tune. 700, 800. 1, 2, 3, 4. Also someone else to phone in. Right. I saw. I saw an advert. Right. There's those toys. I think it must be. Is it? Because it's Easter holidays or something. Right. That's what it's saying. And there's one of those transformer type things. And it goes in its shield, it strikes and it goes into its shield when it goes into a little pod. And I'm sure it was called a bow lock. Right. Now, I must have misheard it. There's no way you can call a little kid's toy a Bolock. So can you phone in? I'm. I'm quite willing to be wrong. It'd be very disappointing. But, you know, are people making Little Bo locks for kids? Oh, wait, 700, 800 1234. And what was the other question? The other question was, who was the fourth person who wrote Arthur's Theme? Yeah. When you get caught between the moon and New York City. Crazy, but it's true. Yeah. The only thing you can do is fall in love. Carl. What was that with Carl last night? Obviously, party animal. You know, he's hanging out with some of my friends. You enjoyed yourself, didn't you? That's all right. But you were a bit worried about Jennifer Lopez, weren't you? Yeah. What was the concern? I don't really know what's going on in the pop world. You. You're joking. No, go on. And I was here in the toilets, right? And I heard it playing out on the speaker and I heard the DJ go, there you go. That's Left Eye Lopez there. That's not. And I thought, it's Jennifer Lopez. No, it's the. She had some sort of eye injury. You thought he was breaking the news of Jennifer Lopez losing an eye by calling her Left Eye Lopez. Yeah. Yeah. That's genius. Don't worry. We put him to. We put him right. It's okay. He slept easy. Yeah, but you're worried for a while. Weren't you anxious for a while? I. I had no idea. And the thing is, I heard that on, like, Thursday. So for like, three days I've been thinking why she called that. Because she changed her name before and she said JLo or something. Yeah. So I thought, you know. Yeah. And she got some people after her. Does she owe someone money? Keep changing her name. That was WA by Gabrielle and Rise. Anyway, more music. Oh, I'd love to. So, yeah. What have you got? What have you got lined up there, Carl? Be a band. Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet. Respect. Massive respect. No, Jew. Jew. Jew. Yeah, Absolutely. Huge respect. See, my friend. Spread Your Love on XFM 104.0. I'm loving this, Steve. It's a lovely day. Yeah, we're playing some great music. We're playing some great tunes, aren't we? Absolutely. Having some great chat. Yeah. Yeah. So let's carry on. Let's get. Absolutely. Well, obviously Carl was out with me last night and he saw that I'm, you know, he knows I'm a ladies man and that was obvious. Car. You could see the vibe around me, couldn't you, when the, you know, when the chicks were talking to me and just remembered recently actually, I was on a train coming back from hometown Bristol and I was on the train and this girl walks on. Good looking girl. I thought, hey, up largely empty carriage. I'm thinking, my luck's in, you know, because I take every opportunity, Carl. That's the thing about me, you know, I don't, I don't choose. She was good looking girl. She sat down, I thought. She sat down right near me. I thought, brilliant. The guy, this guy comes up behind her and says, I think it's probably a boyfriend or something. Sits down next to her and I listen in on the conversation, you know, because I'm pretending to read. It was very clever. I read the same page for hours. I was pretending to listen. I was listening. We're pretending to read. And I realized that it's not her boyfriend or anything, it's just some guy she's met on the platform. And I'm thinking, brilliant. If she's the kind of girl who's just going to start talking to someone, you know, on a platform, on a train, brilliant. I'm going to be in here. Because he was only going one stop. So I'm thinking, what's the worst that can happen? He'll nick off, you know, I'll get chatting to her, you know, and who knows, I could join the. What's the, Is there a train equivalent? The Foot High club. Brilliant. And so I'm excited, you know, I'm listening in and it turns out that they're both kind of graduates who just finished university or they're just, they're coming to the finals or something and they're chatting away, you know, and he's making a couple of witticisms, you know, and she's kind of tittering at his jokes. I'm thinking, well, I'll tell you this, if she's laughing at this kind of material, I am going to blow her away, you know, with my kind of anecdotes and rye observations, you know. It was weak stuff. He was coming out with nothing. Yeah, he was running on empty as far as I'm concerned. Yeah. And she Was loving it. So I'm thinking, brilliant, I'm going to be right in here. And then they get moving on to higher brave things, you know, And I think she was going to study kind of Marxism or so or something like that, or communism, something. And she was asking him, you know, by way of conversation, she was asking him what he knew about Marxism, you know, and he was fumbling for some. His vague knowledge, knowledge of it that he had in his life. And I'm just that sat there thinking, yeah, come on, love. In any given capitalist environment, the proletariat will revolt against their oppression. The bourgeoisie. And after a brief period of socialist rule emerges a classic society governed by community corporation. Well, if that sort of talk wouldn't get a woman hot. I don't know. Come on. I don't know what, what you'd use. If Marks and Engels is not going to get a woman sweaty down below and nothing is, then my name is. You're just biding your time. Exactly. I'm just gonna go in for the kill any minute. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So. So anyway, anyway, it comes to his stop, right? He gets up, I'm thinking, this is, this is a piece of cake. And he gets off and off he goes, he thinking, brilliant. And I thought, I'll wait, you know, I'll wait till the train's pulled away. I'm not going to leap in straight away. And he comes back along the carriage and I'm thinking, hang on a minute. He goes, listen, do you mind if I give you my email address, right, and if you want to get in touch, email me. I'm thinking, come on, you loser, get off now. Save your face, please, before he sum out. And she accepts the email address because she obviously doesn't want to hurt his feelings, whatever. I'm thinking, fair enough. She's a good woman, I'm liking her. I'm thinking, that's my kind of girl. So anyway, he gets off, I'm sat there, the train pulls away. I'm thinking, yeah, I'll wait a few minutes, you know, I'll just, you know, give it some time. Her phone rings, it's her friend on the phone and she starts saying, and I was listening in and she was going, yeah, just met a guy on the train. I'm thinking, yeah, that's true enough. She goes, yeah, he was a good looking guy. I thought you're having a laugh, love, to be honest, because I was looking at him and she said, she said to her friend, he looks a bit like tennis player. Boris Becker. I thought, well, you. You should be so lucky, frankly, because I saw him, he had awful facial hair, if that's what makes him look like Boris Becker. Terrible little goaty beard. It was laughable. I thought, you. I don't know. And then she goes, she goes to thinking. She's like, yeah, I met him. We got chatting and stuff, you know, and she was going, it's not often that. It's not often that you meet someone, you know, generally in life who's, you know, kind of thoughtful and intelligent and funny. I thought to myself, I'm not even gonna waste my time with you, love. Frankly, if that's what you thought of. Him, you just walked away. And I'll be honest with you, I didn't even bother talking to him. No, I didn't even waste my time with him. She thinks that bloke is not only funny, but funny and intelligent. And she got on well and he was polite and it was a chance meeting and he thought. And she thought that you were like a freaky looking dork who didn't even have the nerve to speak. That is what she thinks. That's what she thinks. I don't want to know it. I couldn't. You walked away and good luck to you. And I have my dignity in ch. Yes. And she's nothing. Watch the flower grow, Travis. Flowers in the window on XFM 104.9. Well, coming to that time when we do White Van Man. Absolutely. With producer Carl. And Carl's gonna also gonna be telling us his slant on fables on Aesop. Absolutely. I was out with Carl. I know I shouldn't be. Yeah. I broke the rule as well. I know. Well, I was out with him tonight before, I think, and we were just chatting and as you know, we're. We're going to Edinburgh for a week. Yeah. That's all three of us. That's all three of us. Yeah. There wasn't. I just wondered for a minute if there was some arrangement you two had made, like next weekend, just popping out there, seeing the site. Yeah, no, we're gonna do a week's broadcasting from the Edinburgh Festival. And, you know, and Carl's going, I bet you lie in, don't you? And all this. I was going, well, yeah, he's going, well, he wants to be up at half nine and out looking at the sights. You know what I mean? Yeah. But anyway. And I said, have you ever had haggis? He went, it's black pudding in it. I went, no, it's. It's Mints, even. I like mints. I went, yeah, but wait, it's mints in a sheep stomach, right? And he went, what? They force feed a sheep then kill it. Imagine that, Carl. It makes sense though, doesn't it? No, it doesn't make sense. They force feed a sheep mint and then kill it till its stomach's nice and full. And I go, oh, this one's full. Kill it before it starts digesting it. Of course they don't. It's a membrane. They've. And the other one he was talking about like, he likes Richmond Park. He goes, I like to see all the deers. I went, it's deer's plural. You don't need to say deers. I try and educate whenever I can. What's that? I said, the deer is already. Yeah, I said, you know, like sheep or. Or fish. So you can say fishes and. And we laugh. I said, do you know the plural of mongoose? Because a lot of people think it would be mongoose. It's not. It's mongooses. Do you know what Carl said? Plural of mongoose. Mongoose, yes. It's worth a competition. No, it's not. No, no. Go on, Carl. What did you think the plural of mongoose was? Mongs. Play a record after this. White Van Man. Do you want to play? Oh, let's play a bit of Dylan. Yeah, this is. This is a beautiful track. It's just like a Woman. Well, I think that's a beautiful record. It's by Bob Dylan and it's just like a woman. And Carl went. He's got his headphones on, so he's speaking a bit loud. The harmonic is playing in a. In a whiny mank accent when the harmonics went. That's an annoying sound, Matt, isn't it? God. Oh, bless Bob Dylan. There. An annoying sound there. Did you hear about the annoying sound of Bob Dylan? Like a new album? Yeah, yeah. Just that sort of sound always reminds me of a one man band. Yeah. Have you heard the story about Leo Sayo with his song One Man Band? No. Years ago. What year was. Oh, God, I'm in the Mood for Dancing. What's the song that he did about. I'm a One Man Band? It was called. Right, yeah. Funnily enough, he did that One man band and he was playing it at the Dominion Theater. Yeah. And apparently whenever he played, he sort of sang this song. He got the audience involved and the line. And it was a one man band. Well, nobody knows or understands. Is there anybody There can lend me a hand to my one man. And what he used to do, he used to reach out. Oh yeah, and grab people's hands and then he'd walk down the middle. Anyway, he said, well, anyone lemme. And he stuck his hand out, grabbed like a hand. I was walking down every little. Everyone looked horrified and some woman who had like a plastic hand had to come off. And he's walking down the middle of like Dominion Theater with his plastic hand in his hand and he said, oh, it's a moment I won't forget. He knows how to tell a story. Leo Sayer. All right, well, it's time for White Van man, which is where we ask Carl the questions that the son asks someone else. Exactly. It's an article in there where they asked him, you know, typical man on the street, the, the big questions of the day gives them their platform to the nation. And we think this is just too good to let out because we, I mean we only care about one person's opinion in the, in the country now. True enough, he's the came out and there he is. There he is. Carl, your thoughts please on Kylie Minogue slagging off Britney Spears for ignoring her fans at her premiere. Are you aware of that story? She, she got booed at her premiere of her new film Britney because she, she'd left her fans waiting for like an hour. Some of them had traveled up from. Bristol, other parts, 3,000 of them, loads. Of them screaming for her. She just went straight into the theater an hour late, just gave him a quick wave and straight in, didn't even know. So they were booing. What do you think of that, Carl. And Kylie's obviously said that was actually outrageous, you know, and you should treat your fans with respect. What'd you make of it? So she did wave, literally as she. Was walking into the theater. Was it raining? No, I don't think it was. Like a defense lawyer who hasn't really. Read the brief, just winging it. Judges first joke. Was it raining? No. Ah, I was relying on that. Was she running late for the start of the film? Yes, but that's her own fault. I mean the people are inside, they're not going to start the film without her. It's Britney Spears. Yeah, she could take some time out. You know, when Tom Cruise came here, he spent like an hour and a half shaking people's hands, talking to people on their mobile phones, all sorts. That's Tom Cruise. He's a bigger name than Brittany. I know he's a smaller person, but he's a bigger name. What do people want from people? Do you know what I mean? Yeah. An autograph, things like that. A photo. This one's going nowhere. Steve, Is there another one? Fair enough. Yeah. You know, it's not bad. If she had more time, she might have done it. I bet she would have done it on another day. I mean, I'm not feeling too good today. But you're gonna still take time out to sign people's autographs, surely, when you leave the building? Yeah. There's always a bit of a gravel in there. Next. Gone. What do you make of a New York. New York's ex police chief saying, we need more bobbies on the beat. He's come over here. He's the guy that sorted out crime in New York City. He's come over, he said, you're going all over the place here. You need more bobbers on the beat. Not more policemen, more a visible police presence. There was. There was something last week about some copper in London who was. Sat on a. Sat on a bench and he was asleep or something. And people were, like, outraged because, like, he should be looking after, you know, England's people, not nodding off on a park bench, which is a bit daft. Because they were shouting, he should be looking after England's people. Was this the 16th century you went back to? We're doing this look after. England's free. You know, wherever he was, if he was in, like a park somewhere. Yeah. Like, they were, like, really annoyed because he was asleep. Sure. If. Well, no, but the thing is, if there would have been any trouble, I'm sure he would have woke up. Yeah. If there was any sort of. If someone needed help and he screamed, he would have woke up. So I don't know why they were having a go at him. Yeah. And he might not. He might not have been there at all. So, you know, it was, you know. So. Yeah, he'd probably have his radio turned on, didn't he? Yeah. Listening to heart. So you're not concerned then, that there's. Not that the crime's going up? I see quite a lot of them whizzing around. Okay, you're happy then? Yeah, as long as you're happy, Carl. So you don't think it's too much crime? Just right amount. Just the right amount of crime, yeah. What about the fact that new gambling laws give Blackpool the green light to become a British Las Vegas? What do you make of that? Are you a gambler? A little bit. When I want to go on holiday, like going in the Arcade and having a little flutter. Sure. What's your favorite? I have to go on the. You know the fruit machines. Yeah. It's a good one called the Simpsons. Right. Is that your favorite? Yeah, it's quite good. Is that a time with the TV show the Simpsons? Yeah. Okay. Will they make Blackpool the next Vegas? I don't think so, no. Nor do I see it happening, no. You've been to Blackpool? Yeah. What was it? It's a bit rank, is it? It's a bit rough. Needs a lot of work doing on it. Yeah, no, that won't happen. Okay. And you're not worried about this encouraging gambling generally? Gambling's not a vice you're concerned about. If you're a gambler, you're a gambler. Do you know what I mean? If Blackpool isn't done up, they'll go somewhere else to have a flutter. Sure. So it's not going to make any difference. Okay. No. Okay. Jolly good. What do you make of the so Solid Cruise? Ashley Walters being jailed for 18 months. Months. Obviously not very good example to his young fans. He should have got more. Do you think? I had a dream about him the other night. Go on about about the group itself. Okay. I had a dream that. Were they all there? Because there's a lot of them. I couldn't remember all their faces feature in a dream. I had a T shirt on. He had. Etc. Etc. Yeah, I had a T shirt on. You had a T shirt on? Yeah. And it said on me T shirt so solid poo. And I was walking down the street and they came towards me. Wow, great dream. That's amazing. I love that. That's. We've all 30 year old. We've all had that anxiety dream. Goodness. What if I meet the so Solid crew and I'm wearing a T shirt that slags them off. Oh, I don't believe it. Yeah. You know. Yeah. So what happened? Did you get beaten up in the game? It was one of them where I woke up. Do you know I've been telling you that I keep getting them things where you feel like you're falling. Oh yeah. It was the same sort of thing. You know I'm not a real psychiatrist, don't you? You know, you do know a lot about a lot. Yeah, I do. Thanks very much. And you know if I'm at home talking to Suzanne about something and I don't know the answer, think. Right. I'll ask Ricky. That one seem. Yeah, thanks. But you know that I think you might mentioned before that apparently if you die in A dream. Dream. It means that you're dying in real life. Yeah, yeah. Well, that's it. If you don't. But apparently if you get beaten up by the so Solid crew in a dream, it means you're being beaten up by them in real life. Yeah, that is true. Yeah. Yeah. Terrifying. Absolutely terrifying. So, yeah, lock him up for longer. Okay. Finally, what do you make of Halle Berry becoming the first black woman to win the best actress Oscar? Did you see her speech? Got on my nerves. Did it? I mean, you know, it's good that she won. You know, it's nice for anyone to win an award. Yeah. But she did go on a bit and, you know, I've been in that same sort of position. What, placing an Oscar? Well, I got. What they used to do at school is okay. If you did a full month without being off, you got a gold certificate. Okay. And I did a month once without having a day off. So it went up and I didn't, I didn't make a fuss. You didn't start crying. Can't play a record, mate. Well done, though. Were you the first kid in your school to do that? I don't think anyone else got the certificate. It was only because I was never in. They tried to encouragement. It was just for you, the entire ceremony, just to encourage you. Wise words there from Bella Sebastian on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant. Well, I mean, it is indeed wise words, Rick. I'm worried that people are going to get out of the office now and into the sunshine, not be listening to the show. There's always the transistor radio. That's true enough. Heading down to the park. Take it along. It is time. Keep it low, though. Don't want to irritate other people. I know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And if you do want to irritate them. Spit on them. Exactly. And kick them and throw little rocks. Exactly. With me, Carl Kman Pilkington. We are now we're into this way into the second month of the education of Carl. As you know, Carl got one GCSE in history and he. And we've been cramming, haven't we? Oh, Rick, before you mention that, can I just say something? Obviously we do always do this thing with the sun white van man where we read this thing out from the sun and query Carl. And we met with some friends last night and my friend Dan always listens to the show and he said, Carl, you know, I love the bit when you, you answer the questions in The. In the sun. Why do you have. Do you ever know what the questions are before they're asked? Or is that your first answer? And Carl said, no, that is it. They don't let me see what the questions are first. They don't show them to me. And I always get. I always get really anxious and really get really paranoid. And I was just wondering, have you seen the error there, Carl? Have you seen the mistake you've been making? Right, we're worried that you're worried that you didn't get the questions beforehand. Right? Well, how could you, how could you maybe combat that? How could you combat that if you're really nervous? You know, maybe you wanted to sort. Of have some views or ideas before. It's, it's, it's your error in it. Do you know what I mean? It's your show. If, if you are like, take a chance with me. No, no, no, no. The point is this, that if you're really worried about that, how could you, how could you get hold of those questions in advance? Is there any way you could get hold of those questions in advance? Yeah, but is it always in, in today's. Is it always in Saturdays? Yes, so they don't do that every day of the week? They do, but I always take it from these Saturdays. All right, well, yeah, I could, but that would cost me money. I'm not on enough as it is, working here on a Saturday. Okay, how much is this on 30p. Yeah, well, you're not made of money. Yeah, actually it's 40p on a Saturday. I don't know what I was thinking. Well, you were studying Aesop's Fables, weren't you? This week. Now, now I, I'm gonna very be very liberal here and let you talk about. I'm not. It's not a test. I'm not. Hey, man, just like chill out. I'm not this, like, rigid sort of, you know, boxing society. Just, just tell us your views. Just tell us your vibe on Aesop. Tell us something. What have you learned from these fables? He made a bit of money out of something that's quite simple. I don't know if he did make any money out of it. I mean, it's, you know, I think it was published like thousands of years after his death, but go on. Yeah, they're just, just little stories. I mean, enjoyed them. Yeah. Didn't learn anything from them. Or did. Or did you? You see, because it's teaching through sort of like metaphor and analogy and maybe it all seeps in and it's all subliminal. And maybe in a way your subconscious is teaching you. If, if the stories were done in like a real way, that there's like a. A man and a woman and. And it's a little story that's May happen to them in life, then you learn something. But it's all about, you know, a gorilla and a fox are walking through the woods. How often does that happen? Sure. So you're saying if it was more like. If it was more true to life. If it was more like real stories, like, you know, a kid on his grifter and a magpie picking it, you know, pecking at his head, or two frog boys with webbed hands. I mean, if it was real stories from real life that people could believe. Yeah. Actually happened, maybe, you know, it would teach us something. But why not do that? Like take a real situation, say, like the. So Solid crew guy. Yes. Going down for carrying a gun. Use that in some way. Do you know what I mean? As a warning, maybe, about carrying guns. What about something like if you carry guns and that is illegal, do you. You could have some sort of punishment. Yeah. That's good. It doesn't bother you then that the fact that these fables have been used for many, many generations to educate maybe young children or even older people, the fact that they've served a brilliant function and they've become classics, that doesn't bother you? You. You've seen through them? Well, they don't always work. When I was out with Rick the other day, he brought one up. I told him the one about the. The. The two mice, the industrious mouse who throughout the summer he would be storing berries, nuts and berries, and he'd be storing it, and the other must just be eating off the trees and running around and having a laugh. And they go, well, you're gonna become hungry. We go, oh, I'll worry about that when it comes to it. And they do that. And he'd be storing his nuts and berries and all came and the mouse was still playing and not doing anything. And then winter came and the silly mouse was like, shivering, and he went. Knocked on the nurse's door and went, I'm freezing and I'm starving. And the clever man said, well, I told you, didn't I? You know, you should have been storing your nuts through winter like I did. Come in and share mine, you know. And what did you say, Carl? Well, and the moral of that is. Whatever. Yeah. You know, sort of, you know, just be careful. But my thing is that it's not very good. Because the moral of that is do what you want. And there's always a Do Gooder chair there. Yeah. But the way I, you know, I think which is more sort of 2002, the ending should have been, you know, the guy with all the berries should have like been like, yeah, no, I'll be all right. Come the winter. I've got loads of food, I'll be safe. But then as he's going into his little hut at the beginning of the winter, some sort of boss or something comes and kills him. And it's like you should have partied. Hard because you might die. Yeah. Enjoy life whilst you've got it. Yeah. Okay. And if winter comes, just starve to death. Well, you know, worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow. Okay. Okay. I'm wondering if there's a new book here. I really am wondering if there's a car. He's been coming up with the sum all week. He keeps going. Well, that's a favor in it. Yeah. So what's your favorite Fabian there? Have you learned anything from this book to get me, you know, Is there one favor you liked? Yeah, I mean, what do you like? They're all. Alright, what'd you like? Throwing it on me. Now there. Then you like one about a crab. He said, no, that was the one about messing about on a cliff edge or something. Don't mess about on a cliff edge. What was that? I don't know. There's not many around here. So I didn't take much interest. I mean, God, I'm doing my best. Here's one. There's one that was quite nice. There was a belly, you know, like your stomach. Yeah. And, and it's this belly on a pair of legs. And the legs were saying, I'm more important than you because I, I carry, I carry you around. And the belly said, yeah, but you know, if it weren't for me holding all this food, you wouldn't have the energy to walk around. Yeah. And that means, like, you know, rather than working on your own, it's best to work in a team. Yeah. So. Well, the one, the one similar to that I was taught when I was little was a vision of heaven and hell. And in it went down to hell and in hell. Right. There was. These people had like 20 foot long chopsticks. Yeah. And they, they were getting their food and they would, they couldn't get the chopsticks into the food and get it around their mouth because they were just too long. Right, right. That was how. And in heaven they had exactly the same thing. But they were feeding each other. What? All right, you don't like Chinese food? Is that what your concernees call? No, I'm just. See my. The one I remember. I can't remember the ending. It's about two nuns in a bath. Yeah. Oh, I know. I can't remember what it is. Or is it. Are they on a bike? That's two adventures. It's the same nuns but they go to all sorts of adventures. They. Erotic adventures. Well, they are. There's one when they're driving down a cobbler. Bald Street. I remember. And then there's the other. Then of course they get Whale Bones on XFM 104.9. I'm Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant. Hello, Carl. Well, Card, I really don't think you got your teeth into the fables. Really. I don't think you. There wasn't anything to learn. I read a couple thought. Yeah, that's all right. And put it down again. There wasn't anything to learn. It was all stuff I knew already, but made up with nice little foxes and bears and stuff. So. Yeah, but that one about like. That's one we spoke about, like when the hairs are going, we should share all our food. And the lion said, that's a good argument. But you haven't got. It hasn't got the teeth and claws that we've got. That's lovely because it's sort of like, you know, that's an indictment on sort of. You know, you could say it's an anti. Equality almost. You know, you could get really sort of deep into that. You know what I mean? You could. No Big philosophical ideas in a nutshell. Not interesting. No. Okay. Okay then. Well, you're gonna hate this then. I've brought in the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. Now just look at some of your favorites. I'd suggest going to straight to things like Wild or Newton or Churchill or. You're a big fan of Churchill. Yeah. Oh, well, he's. He's the boy. Yeah. Okay, let's go through that old chrome. Newton. Right, right, here's a famous one. Okay. This is Isaac Newton. If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants. Do you like that one? So there's a meaning in it. Yeah, well, he hasn't actually stood on the shoulders of John. So he's. So remember, he's a. He's an amazing inventor and mathematician and he discovered the incredible laws of the universe. And. And he's saying. Yeah, if you want a good view moving to a multi story. He's saying, right. He's saying if I've seen, if I have seen further the people. And he's being modest here. It's because I've stood on the shoulders of giants to get that view. If it weren't for all the people that have come before him with their great insight and knowledge, he wouldn't have seen what he said. He's taken his learnings and those people. Have given him say that instead of making up. That's what I've got a problem with. People don't. Poetry, poetry, art and in life though. People never say what they actually mean. And you know, there's loads of books on it. I don't know. But, but the point is that he's. He's just summarized quite a tricky idea beautifully. It's beautiful. That gets into you much deeper than just the words and just the literal words, you know. I mean, one of my favorites is from an American novelist. And the quote is talking about the subject of fame and being famous. Fame is a mask that eats into the face. Don't you think that's amazing? Meaning? Well, meaning that the faint, that fame is something that is artificial, that you wear initially you become famous. But it's, it's. It's ethereal, it's nothing. It's intangible. It's just an artifice. But if you stay famous long enough, you begin to think that that mask you're wearing is really your real face. So that you begin to, you know, think that you are more than. Than you perhaps are. Do you see what I mean in the way that fame and power can corrupt? I know you've said that. It's an American novelist. I forget his name. Sorry. Yeah, there's something out. Pick another one. Right, yeah, let's have a look. Oh, Bernard Shaw. He's no slouch. I think maybe when you read. When you take this book of quotations home car. You should maybe just draw up maybe list of three or four of your favorite next week. What is Shaw? Wild. I look at Shakespeare as well, you know, he's. Are you a fan of Shakespeare? No, go on. What's your. What's your problem with it? Just the way they speak. I can't follow it. Yeah, yeah, it's really old as well. I can't relate to it. It's like years and years ago in it. That's why I like Churchill, because 1940s. Yeah, look at this, look at this. This is Shaw. Okay. There are two tragedies in life One is not to get your heart's desire. The other is to get it. Again. How would you see that in your little. Well, that's your. That's one homer. Then I'll mark that. That's your homework. You've got to work that out. You've got to tell me what you think of it. Say again. Don't ask, Suzanne. It's there. All right. There are two tragedies in life. One is not to get your heart's desire. The other is to get it. Okay, take that home with you and we'll be hearing. Carl, come up with some amazing quotations next week. Yeah, pick out your favorites. Now, I'd like to play a song for the lovers while he's thinking. No, I don't think we've got the lovers lined up. Oh, what have we got? Hip hop. It's hip hop. Hooray. Oh, is it? Yeah, everyone's a big fan. I played something from this last week. It's this new album from Nerd In Search Of. It's been re recorded by the lads. I don't know why. And anyways, particularly good. We played last week. Things are getting better. This is the one we have played with in the past, actually. Bobby J Games from the album In Search Of. That's Nerd. And the track is Bobby J. Loving it, Loving It. Doves. There Goes the Fair on XFM 104.9. Well, just read that book anyway. I'll just. I just. Could I just say this is one of a beautiful. Is Keats, right? What do you think of this? A thing of beauty is a joy forever. Its loveliness increases. It will never pass into nothingness. See this? This is just like how it was at school. Now, the last couple of weeks have been quite interested in what you've been giving me. Now it's. It's really like. Okay, I really don't care. Now this. What about this? Now, I did philosophy, and philosophy is obviously the, you know, the quest for knowledge and it's, you know, it's a. Look, listen to this, though. This is what Keats came out with. Philosophy will clip an angel's wings. Isn't that beautiful? Yeah. Don't be constrained by what's, you know, dream a little. You know what I mean? Just go beyond. I don't agree with it, but it's a lovely. It's a lovely bit of poetry. Yes. Yeah. So you're gonna read that for me, are you, Carl? Yeah, just pick out five of your favorites. Yeah, the ones that mean something to you. And Then next week I'll bring you a picture of animals. Brilliant. Brilliant. Okay, we'll do it. Okay. And some sweets. Rick, I've had a word with some of the. The top brass here. Or they had a word with me in the corridor, if you remember. Who are you? Pretty much. Yeah. Wait, four eyes. Yeah. And no, they said they were sending. You know, obviously, enjoy the show. They love it. And they're just worried, though, that in the early days when we started the show, remember, we were a lot more informative. We used to do the film reviews. Yeah. Things like the Gig guide and stuff, which we've kind of let. Yeah, yeah. They want us to bring that. Well, exactly. So I just wanted. No, no, no, no. The gig guide. I was worried that, funnily enough, the XBOM Gig Night Gig Guide does not include some of the biggest bands in the world. Okay. All right. Or some of the best venues. That's what worried me, Rick. Just do what you're told. Right, there's the gig guy. Has it got better? He's got so long. Gonna be impressed. You're gonna love the gig ideas. I need a bet if this is gonna be pretty impressive. Let's play the proper jingle. Okay. Okay. Ah, tonight, if you want to. Oh, hey. If you want to see these two Bats fans in a small venue, get down to the Metro Bar on Oxford street. Doors are at 8pm and tickets are only six quid to see 10 Benson and Beach Buggy. All right? Now, if you missed Long Wave supporting the Strokes at Brixton Academy last night, you can catch some headlining Casino Royale at the Monarch. Rick, I missed them last night. How much will I be paying for that? You'll only be paying £5. Right, but listen, they're also supported by Shelby and I remember nothing. Brilliant. Now. Now, people know about the Rixon Academy, but a little known venue in Rixon is the Windmill. And you're gonna see three great bands there tonight. Guapo Plonkes and Mechanical Beatles. Never quite warm. So Orange Goblin and Grand Magus play the Garage and, well, the Defin. What's it? Diefenbach and Sudden play the Rotar Sessions at Nine Hills Arts Club. So that's the gig guy. The next boom. What a load of rubbish. I mean, switch off the jingle. Look at this. We've discussed this before, haven't we? Names for bands that will never be anything. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Mechanical Beatles. Never quite warm. Welcome to the stage Plankwed. Please welcome to the stage Orange Goblin. Oh, goodness me, look at this. Oh, God. Orange Goblin. Orange Goblin. He's so rubbish. What's his name? Got a fake town, hasn't he, that wanted his supermarket suite? What's his name? Dale. Dale Winston. Yeah. Supporting rem. I remember. Nothing. Never gonna happen. Just. I mean, please. Come on, people. Hey, here's a band that plays big venues. Doesn't make them better. Sure, but this is Radiohead. This is Song for the Lovers and Let Down Off. Okay, computer. This is beautiful. See, a thing of beauty is a joy forever. Doesn't that move you at all, Carl? Philosophy will clip an angel's wings. There was an old lady for Kneeling. Who was putting Radiohead Let down Off. Okay, computer. Apparently we missed. We missed a gig on that gig. I did drip feed a play in the Rock garden on the 21st this month. Excellent. So the lead singer just called in that. He also left a quote with me. Apparently Coleridge said of Keats, wasn't it? He's like an archangel. Slightly damaged. Rick, I'm worried we're getting a little bit high, bro. Do you reckon. Have you got any knob gags you could do quickly? Because I'm just thinking we're switching. There's a lot of people are going to be turning off. I mean, currently. Currently on Capital FM, Chris Tarrant and Dr. Neil Fox. Together at last. The partnership. I said it would never happen. Do you know, I'd like to see together that breakfast DJ Sarah Cox and who's the. The dancer? Carl Cox. Carl, please. Why are you getting. Suddenly saying these rude words? We've been reprimanded once. And don't say it so aggressively because it sounds like you're saying Cox aggressively. Come on. We've been reprimanded. All right, that. Just don't use language like that. Why is it annoying you? We're talking about DJs. That's their names. You try to be clever. I hardly think that's clever. Yeah, if that's my best attempt at being clever. I've got rubbish homework this week. Okay. He's really upset about this. He was looking forward to animal fat. You said you were going to bring in that big book. 500 Animals. So I got it off one of those bargains. But I thought it'd be easy. Right, because it's. It's. But it's too elementary. No, but that's more useful than that to me. But it's things like. It's things like the tortoise has a shell to protect it. That's good. Yeah, but you know, you thought it. Was there just to be painted on. Oh. Have you ever. Have you ever peeled a tortoise? They fly. They go about 400 miles an hour, is to weigh them down because they're the fastest lizards known to man. Honestly. They run so fast, they can go through walls. Yeah. And so that they. Their shells put on them in the hospital, in the maternity ward at a very early age to slow them down. You let a tortoise shower and you won't catch it. Steve, do you know that turtles can breathe out of the bum? Turtles can breathe out of their bum. I know someone who can talk out of it, but didn't realize that. Tell us about that. Tell us about that. That's all I know. When they go swimming, they can sort of. If they don't want to get their. Stick their head out, they can just. Stick their arse out. Why don't they want to stick their head out? Just if. I don't know, Maybe they don't need. They need to be looking for food under the water. Yeah. And if they stick their head up to get some air, they might miss something. Wouldn't it be easier to have an ass that could forage for food? So they could sort of like lounge in the pool like a Jacuzzi? And they're looking around going, all right, hello. Hiya. And meanwhile, its ass is like munching grass. Yeah. Wouldn't that be easier? Bad breath. Wow. I wish I understood what that meant in all this. Hilarious quote, isn't it? But in all that, this hilarity, I'm worried we've forgotten the true meaning of Easter. No, come on, Rick. Come on, come on. You just, you know, you're being frothy and lightweight and a little bit rude, but, you know, it is. It's a time for remembering and chocolate that someone did die for our sins. Yeah. So can we just be ashamed to disappoint him? Yeah. Can we just think about that and just take a moment just to consider that? Can we do that? All right. Okay. Yeah. You understand the true meaning of Easter. It's not just about eggs and bunnies. You understand it, don't you? Yeah. What's your memory of it? What's your understanding of it, Carl? What's it all about for you? What do you have to do at school? Do you have to do anything at school? I think we've got a long weekend off, okay? Really? Yeah. What did they call that weekend? Easter weekend. Brilliant. Okay. And what was the reason for that? Why do we have Easter weekend off? Jesus. Yeah, but what did he do? He. He put himself on the cross. Yeah, well, he didn't put himself. No. Does it mean anything to you? Are you moved by that story again? Too long ago for me to sort of. Okay, you know, to worry about it. Sure, yeah. I mean, if there'd have been an Anderson shout, were involved. Yeah, you'd have been. You'd have been there, wouldn't you? You're not well today, are you, Carl? Not at all. Don't know what's wrong with me today. I've got a bit of a temperature. Have you? Do you know Steve, like, you know, he's always on the gun at me. Last night when we're out with his mates. Yeah. They said he was a bit of a hypochondriac himself. Did they? Yeah. What did they say? What were they saying? He said. He said. I said, steve's told me he's not feeling well. You know, Is he all right? You live with him. He said, oh, don't worry about that. Really. He's always saying that. And I said, that's a bit of a fable said. Cry wolf. Yeah. One day I say, I've got a temperature and they go, oh, I've had the Lem sip, and he'll die. Yeah. Yeah. I've learned my lesson. Yeah. There was one about cry. The boy cried wolf. It. That the mole can surely only be. Never tell the same lie twice. You know what I mean? Because if he'd have, like, come up with a different one, he'd have kept him going all year, I reckon that's a good point. Yeah. I never thought of it like that before. What, we're gonna play a final tune, have we? What we got. We got. We got a bit of sway, don't we? Well, it depends. Let's get a bit of swaying and song for the ladies. Don't say that. Yeah, I'll give us your song. What's the football? What's the match? What's this? A lot. The gig guide is Long wave and guapo and plankers. What's this? What's the football match? What? The football matches. XFM covering. Come on. Would you like track eight? Bolton versus Barnsley. You don't like sport, though, do you do. Huh? A lot of people who do. Right, Track eight. What are we going for, then? We're going for. It's a bit of Stevie Wonder. Yeah. And I think it's quite a short song, though. Carly, you're gonna. It's okay. You're okay. So this is the final song. This lost a lot of energy. This show. This is it. I mean, the first hour and 40 minutes, I think, was dynamite. I think the last 10 have been. Carl, he was. He was full of life, you know, he was answering the questions and stuff. And now he was. And he got fed up. He got fed up with the quotations. He didn't like us mentioning in Radio One DJs such as Sarah Cox and Carl. Oh, Cox. Yeah, he didn't like that. Sorry, everyone. I never dreamed you'd leave in summer.",

The commission acknowledged that the presenter's remarks were intended to be humorous, but took the view that the amount and detail of the corsicial innuendo had exceeded acceptable boundaries for broadcast, said the BSC in a statement. The complaint objected to a section in the Comics Saturday afternoon show when he discussed the different meanings of the word. Gervais wondered aloud whether the word was acceptable when discussing birds, but not the male sexual organ. A BSC spokesman said the comedian went on and on about it for nearly five minutes. Xfm, a self styled alternative radio station station, said in its defense that its remit was to provide cutting edge programs for a youth audience. The station said the program's brief was to include elements of alternative comedy within certain shows that would not fit within a more mainstream radio station format. In this particular show, it was not the presenter's intention to shock when they took a humorous look at how the English language could be construed in different ways within different contexts. Gervais, whose big break was on telephone's 11 o'clock show, has shot to household status through the portrayal of David Brent, the middle manager from hell, in BBC2's cult show the Office.",

That's the thing about me, you know, I don't, I don't choose. She was good looking girl. She sat down, I thought. She sat down right near me. I thought, brilliant.

It was very clever. I read the same page for hours. I was pretending to listen. I was listening. We're pretending to read. And I realized that it's not her boyfriend or anything, it's just some guy she's met on the platform. And I'm thinking, brilliant.

I'm thinking, well, I'll tell you this, if she's laughing at this kind of material, I am going to blow her away, you know, with my kind of anecdotes and rye observations, you know. It was weak stuff.
