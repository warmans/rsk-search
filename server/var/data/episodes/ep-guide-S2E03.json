Created first in the mind and will, created next in activity. The future is not some place we are going to, but one we are creating. From the schoolboy dreaming of big adventures to the scientists envisioning groundbreaking discoveries, we all care to imagine what the future will bring. Many people have attempted to predict the future, others to mold and control it. But what do we really know of the future? How does the past inform it? And what educated guesses can we make about the shape of things to come? To discuss these questions and more, I'm joined by Stephen Merchant, award winning writer and graduate of the University of Warwick.",

And a big prediction they're sort of sure of, is that androgyny will rule. There'd be so little difference between men and women apart from the biology. Economically, socially- It won't matter who the biggest bread winner is, that's already being phased out. If you're in a traditional heterosexual male-female couple, it won't be: who stays home, who earns the most or whatever. It won't be governed by gender, and that's getting less and less anyway as it is now. But soon you won't even need a female or a man in your life. You'll just need the egg or sperm and you'll be able to have any coupling you want or not. Thoughts, Steve?",
