But there's that rip off thing with beds where you buy a bed but a mattress doesn't come with it. Which I've never understood that because it's not a bed, is it? Without that mattress, it's not a bed. It's a car without an engine. You won't go, there you go. That seems cheap. There's no engine in it. So we bought this. We bought this, like, you know, flat, what have you. And we bought the bed and then I haven't got a mattress. So my dad got one. From Uncle Alf? No. Well, from that Uncle Alf fella because he had one in his van that he used to use now and again if he was like traveling round, he'd just keep in the. In the back on this mattress.",
