If there's any English students or professors or novelists or poets listening, please email us what I thought of that poem. Why it's good, why it's bad. So, you know, give us your thoughts on that. I mean, we would love expert opinion poets, English professors. Just email us@podcastikkijavais.com Now, Carl, apart from being a poet, you are an author now. You have, you've written a book, you know, which surprised me and Steve, because as Steve said, we thought you'd read a book before you actually wrote one, but you've proved us, proved us wrong and all your teachers wrong and everyone in the world who thinks you're an idiot is actually a very good book. I mean, a lot of it is transcripts from, you know, the podcasts. But you've answered some of your critics, haven't you? And you've, you've tried to prove some of your theories. It's everything about car. It is like all the drawings, all the drawings. There's new stories, isn't there? I mean, there's so much effort. I can't believe it. He's been working on it for months and it's out on the 18th of September. But you can order it now, can't you? On Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk what's that book called? It's called the World of Carl Pilkington. Well, thanks very much. Goodbye from me, Ricky Gervais, Goodbye from Stephen Merchant.
