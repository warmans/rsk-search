A seemingly simple concept, but the realities of making those good laws and enforcing them have troubled society since time immemorial. From community service to capital punishment, everyone has a view on how we protect the innocent and punish the guilty. Is one man's law another man's tyranny? Is justice available to all? Does prison work? Should we lock up law breakers and throw away the key? Or does that fail to address the root causes of crime? To discuss these questions and more, I'm joined by Stephen Merchant, award winning writer and graduate of the University of Warwick.",

That's a big, long, 45 minutes, hour long journey. And there were not barriers at either end in those days. So I could get on the tube at one end and get off the other end and no one ever checked my ticket. I was buying tickets every day for months and months and months, and it was starting to seem to me weird I was like \"No ones ever checking this\". So of course, you know I got a little bit lazy, maybe. I stopped buying tickets occasionally taking the trip back and forth - ba-ba-ba-ba-boom - and then for maybe a month travelled without a ticket. And then I was coming up - kind of got bit blasé. Obviously, coming up in an Oval station, someone steps up and says, \"excuse me, can I see your ticket\". And that's terrible because when you're in your mid 20s, it's not like a kid anymore. When you are an adult, you've made a reasoned decision there. You can't plead ignorance. So I said \"Ahem Sorry?\" - \"Yeah do you - let me see a ticket, please\". And I went \"Yeah-yeh-yeh\". So I was looking through because for some reason I used to keep a lot of old tickets. I was looking through, pretending to look for my ticket. I went \"Oh, I don't know what's happened to it, but I did, actually. I bought one at Shepherd's Bush\" and they went, \"okay, if we phone up Shepherd's Bush and there's no evidence of you buying a ticket, you can go to prison. I'm going to ask you again. Have you got a ticket?\"",

And he said he said, but you wouldn't recognize them now. He said, they are the most respectful people you'd ever seen. He said, yeah, they're just lovely businessmen. High of sophistication now. You'd never guess. And then one day he came over to his busy pub. He went, Rick, steve. He said, you know those geezers I did the job with? I did this time with the other three. I said, they are in the pub here now. See if you can guess who they are. So you can never guess who they are. I looked around. I saw three blokes in sheepskin coats with tinted hair covered in gold sovereigns and gold necklaces. And I went, no. He went those three. I went, you are joking. You are fucking joking.

The picture they used was this one. And he showed me this fake passport. And I'll tell you what, I was laughing. Then he started chuckling and we laughed about ten minutes, because all they did was, they cut out the picture on the first series of The Office from the DVD.

But um, this time I was given a security and he came in a suit. He was about 30, he looked quite unassuming. I thought he was from a, just a security firm and there was a couple of them and uh, first of all, they were talking to each other and I thought, \"Well, the stakes are higher here, I don't know why.\" And uh, they drove us to the hotel and there was  uh, loads of people going into the hotel. I mean, much bigger stars than me, you know? There was Ed Norton and- and George Clooney and they were going in and out. And he goes, \"I- we can go past these.\" And he called ahead and he knew everyone, he just knew everyone. And we went down in the car park. We were met by another security guard in the hotel that let us go past everyone. I mean, Clooney's having to queue up and sign. I'm thinking, \"This is weird.\" And I was feeling bit guilty because I was there to promote the film and I think, \"This security guard is so good, I'm never going to ever have to bump into anyone.\" It was amazing.",
