The English biologist Thomas Huxley once wrote: \"To a person uninstructed in Natural History, his country or seaside stroll is a walk through a gallery filled with wonderful works of art. Nine-tenth of which have their faces turned to the wall. Teach him something of natural history, and you place in his hands a catalog of those which are worth turning around. To some, the wonders and intricacies of the natural world are a miracle. Living proof of the existence of God. To others the natural world is a wondrous illustration of Darwinian evolution. To discuss the complexities of plant and animal life, I'm joined by Stephen Merchant, graduate of the University of Warwick and award-winning writer.",

They gnaw their way through New York, London and Tokyo, digesting spilled larders, ghost supermarkets and human corpses, and turning them into new generations, of rats and mice. Whose racing populations explode out of the cities and into the countryside. When all the relics of human profligacy are eaten, populations crash again and the rodents turn on each other and on the cockroaches, scavenging with them. In a period of intense competition, short generations, perhaps with radioactivity enhanced mutation rates, boost rapid evolution. With human ships and planes gone, islands become islands again, with local populations, isolated, save for occasional lucky raftings. Ideal conditions for evolutionary divergence. Within five million years, a whole range of new species replace the ones we know. Herds of giant grazing rats are stalked by saber-toothed, predatory rats. Given enough time, will a species of intelligent cultivated rats emerge? Will rodent historians and scientists eventually organize careful archaeological digs? And through the struts of our long compacted cities reconstruct the peculiar and temporary tragic circumstances that gave ratkind, it's big break?",
