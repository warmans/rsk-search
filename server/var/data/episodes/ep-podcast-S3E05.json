It's like a massive slap in the face. It's like girls coming up to you and going, not interested. Just by being there, they don't have to say anything and they're rejecting you. And so one of my friends has been reading this book, the Game, right, by this guy called Neil Strauss, which is sweeping a certain part of the population because it is one of those books written on how to meet women and seduce women, right? There's this guy called Neil Strauss who infiltrated a sort secret organization in America of blokes who've got all these various seducing techniques, right? And one of the techniques which we've been discussing is something called negging, where if you see a very attractive woman, the theory is that she's getting asked that all the time by blokes, right? They're always coming up and saying, oh, you're really beautiful. Can I buy you a drink? And that what you have to do to set yourself away from the pack is to sort of not be so obviously complimentary. So you come up and you almost sort of pay her a backhanded compliment, or you almost neg, as they say, say something slightly negative. So what you might say is you might go up to her and say, oh, I like your shoes. I've seen another girl wearing them in the club, right? And the theory is that she's sort of. Oh, and she's a bit taken aback. She's a bit thrown off. And then, of course, you start complimenting her and you start building her back up again. It's very elaborate, mind games. I'm not saying it's a good idea, but we've been talking about the neg, and I was chatting to a girl, and I was a little bit drunk and I wasn't thinking it through, and I thought about the neg because it wasn't going very well. But I don't think you should say to a girl, I think your ears are a bit too big for your head because, like, you know what I mean? It's like you can't come back from that. And it's. There's nowhere else to go because that really is just an insult.",
