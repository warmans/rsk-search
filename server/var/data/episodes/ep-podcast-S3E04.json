This is what, I don't know if you've heard this Carl, for people who don't realize Carl was making a couple of little 3 minute TV projects recently that were on Channel 4 and in the Sunday Times. Someone's written a letter about Carl to the Sunday Times. They can send in comments and views on things they've seen, read, heard. And this is what someone wrote to the Sunday Times. Who is Carl Pilkington and why have I just wasted five minutes of my life listening to some of his cretinous thoughts on Channel 4? He asked, why are there so many dinosaurs on display in museums? Quotes. Couldn't they just choose the best one and just show that? He summed it all up by deciding that we know too much. Somebody clearly doesn't know enough to know that.
