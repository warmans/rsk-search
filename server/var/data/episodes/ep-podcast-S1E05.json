We do this ourselves. We're three little fellas. We haven't got an entourage and millions of people working for us. It's just us in a little room. But thank you so much. One in particular. Remember a couple of weeks ago we asked if there's any house dj's out there, maybe they could do a dance megamix with the words I could eat a knob at night. Karl just said that in conversation, talking about someone in a reality game show. I'm a celebrity. Get me out of here. Who ate a kangaroo penis and he just came out with the phrase I could eat a knob at night. Someone has risen to the challenge. We had about 70 different songs. We're going to play our favorite at the end of the show and maybe put some of the others on the website, rickyjavay's dot. So you can go there and hear great dance tracks.
