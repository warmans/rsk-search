        "content": "Hello, I'm Ricky Gervais. To some society is a cage, trapping and oppressing freethinking individuals. But to others, society offers essential structure and regulation, preventing anarchy in the worst excesses of human behavior. Each society has its own codes of conduct, ways of doing things. But who decides these social norms, and how are they governed? From the formative democracy of ancient Greece, to the communist totalitarianism of Soviet Russia, history has shown us that there are as many forms of society as there are people to populate them. To discuss society and our place within it, I'm joined by Stephen Merchant, award-winning writer and graduate of the University of Warwick.",
