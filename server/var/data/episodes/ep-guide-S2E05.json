Extensively covered by saltwater oceans, it supports a myriad of organisms, the most evolved of which is man. Yet how we humans interact with our world could be sowing the seeds of our own destruction. With environmental concerns still high on the political agenda, what is the future of life on Earth? How are we coping with the threat of global warming? And is our newfound ecological concern too little, too late? To discuss the past, present and future of the Earth, I'm joined by Stephen Merchant, award winning writer and graduate of the University of Warwick.",
