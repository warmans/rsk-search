The appendix is- used to be an organ that was packed with um these err enzymes that help break down things like cellulose. But because of our diet now, and because the, err you know, cooking and other things, we don't need to eat a lot of cellulose. We don't eat very, very low grade things like, like rabbits, for example, huge appendix and cecum, and they use it to break down the cellulose. They actually eat their own feces to get it through again. But we get a lot of nutrients out of food now. We eat very rich food, so we sort of don't need the appendix. And also, when something goes wrong with the appendix, if it bursts, it can infect you and you can die from it. So sort of what's the point in having it? We don't need it and it can only cause us harm. That was the question, I think that Rob was putting to you. So now what are your thoughts on the human appendix?",
