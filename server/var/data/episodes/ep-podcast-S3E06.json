You have like a telly for your own bed, like you're allowed to use if you pay for it, right? So. So the glow from that woke me up because they come on at about 10 past 7 and the tell is in front of your head, right? So you're getting this glow and you're going, oh, what's that now? And I looked at it and all it had on written on it is, Carl received bad news about your father, right? And I was like, is this what they do now? Because it's such a big hospital that he just text you sort of news to your bed? And I was kind of like, what's like. I say it was early, it was 10 past 7 or whatever. What's going on? I didn't have my mobile. Suzanne took that and I was looking, I read it again. I thought it might come up with more like, what's up with him? Turns out it was just a review for Neighbours. It just tells you. It tells you what's on the telly that day. And there's some fella in Neighbours who's called Carl, whose dad went bad. So that sort of woke me up a bit.
