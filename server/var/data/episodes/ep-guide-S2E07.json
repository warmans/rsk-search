Yet even now, in the most democratic and economically advanced nations, charity is still necessary. Does this mean that charitable acts are failing to affect meaningful change? Should charity even be the responsibility of individual citizens, or is it the obligation of government? Do handouts make people lazy, independent, instead of resourceful and responsible for their own livelihoods? Is it every man for himself, or are we all in this together? To discuss these questions and more, I'm joined by Stephen Merchant, award winning writer and graduate of the University of Warwick.",

I was told all this when I signed up and I agreed to that amount, ten pounds that I said, I'm happy to give you. That's what I can afford. Call some other people up who aren't giving you a tenner. She goes, no, but we haven't got their numbers and we understand that you're a supporter of our charity and just a little bit more will help. I said, listen, I can't. I've give you that amount if you want. If it's not enough, let's stop the direct debit now. If it's not helping you, let's can it and I'll give it to deafkids.com.
