Suzanne called me to say she'd gone for a haircut and that she'd meet me in the supermarket. I went to the supermarket, but she wasn't there. I called her and she said she was near the fruit aisle.

I wish she'd take a picture of a magazine or ask for a style rather than letting the hairdresser do what she wants. I said, I only tell her to do this as she's got a square head and a close cut hairdo makes it look squarer. She said, \"What do you think of this cut?\" I said it looked alright as I couldn't be bothered arguing about it. It's weird writing a diary. I don't know who thought of doing one of these first. The last time I did one was at school. They used to get you to do it so they could keep an eye on whatever you were up to. My diary used to say the same thing every night.
