So definitely, if you want to see them, Carl, that's the place to go. But we've had one from Vancouver, Canada, from a girl called Amy. And Amy herself is chinese. And she realized herself that she'd never really seen a chinese homeless person. And although she says that apparently Vancouver has the first or second largest chinese population in Canada, she'd never seen them. And she actually went for a walk around the Chinatown in her area looking for them, and she could not find any on that particular day.
