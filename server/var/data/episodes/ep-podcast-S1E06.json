And she realized herself that she'd never really seen a chinese homeless person. And although she says that apparently Vancouver has the first or second largest chinese population in Canada, she'd never seen them. And she actually went for a walk around the Chinatown in her area looking for them, and she could not find any on that particular day.

It's the, the psychology of people that get off on seeing an animal ripped to pieces. They wouldn't like it if it was a robot. They wouldn't care. For some reason in their psychology, they like, they like this sport. Why does it have to be a sport? They're not culling, they're not putting things down for a good.
