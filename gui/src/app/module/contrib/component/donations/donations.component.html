      <p>
        The running cost for this site is around Â£20 per month including compute, storage and other minor costs.<br />
        Rewards are also a small overhead. If users find this service useful and wish to contribute but do not have<br/>
        time to contribute transcripts, they may instead choose to donate a small amount of money to help fund server costs.

        <strong>What happens if nobody donates?</strong><br/>
        Probably nothing. I had planned to run the site indefinitely without donations. It's just another option to help out.
