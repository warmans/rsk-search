        <p>To submit a transcript you must authenticate with a valid Reddit account (Oauth2).</p>
        <p>This app will never see your secret data (password etc.) will only be allowed to see only your public
          identity.
          This will be stored against your submission.</p>
        <p>If you reddit account is not in good standing (e.g. suspended, negative karma) or very new your request
          will fail.</p>

          <strong>Oauth</strong><br/>
          <p>Oauth is a common mechanism you have probably seen many times in the form of "Login with
            facebook/google/etc".
            Imagine you have a library membership and you want a friend to be able to borrow a specific book on your
            account. How could it work?</p>
          <p>It doesn't make sense to give your friend your library card as they would then know your secret card
            number and
            could check out multiple books without you knowing. But what if you could tell the library to allow a
            specific person to
            borrow a specific book for a specific amount of time? That way your friend would be limited to only
            accessing the information
            you have agreed to and you wouldn't need to share your secret card number.</p>
          <p>That is effectively how oauth works. The reddit authorization screen is you telling the reddit to allow
            this website to read
            some very specific information (in this case your public identity). Since you never provide any of your
            reddit credentials directly
            to this website, it is limited to accessing only what you have allowed.</p>
          <p>Here is an example of the sort of data reddit considers your <a
            href="https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example"
            target="_blank">identity</a>.</p>
          <p>Discord has a similar
            <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user#user-object" target="_blank">identity</a>.
