<h4 class="mb-2">What do I do?</h4>
<p>Depending on if this is a new transcript, or you are editing an existing one the main objectives are two:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Split each line so that it accurately reflects the audio (including a prefix to indicate who is speaking
    e.g. <span class="code">karl:</span>)
  </li>
  <li>Correct the text of any line was not transcribed accurately.</li>
  <li>Add additional non-speech information e.g. <span class="code">ricky laughs</span> (use actor <span
    class="code">none:</span> for these lines)
  </li>
  <li>Add <span class="code">#OFFSET</span> markers if they are missing.</li>
  <li>Add <span class="code">#SYN</span> (synopsis) and <span class="code">#TRIVIA</span></li>
</ol>

<p>IMPORTANT: Try and keep the <span class="code">#OFFSET</span> tags as close to the corresponding text as possible</p>

<h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">Audio Navigation</h4>
<p>If Autoseek is enabled the audio will skip to an <span class="code">#OFFSET</span> if your caret
  (flashing line that shows where text will be inserted) moves over it.</p>
<p>Additionally pressing the <span class="badge">{{editorConfig?.playPauseKey || 'Insert'}}</span> key will
  toggle the audio (play/pause),
  <span class="badge">{{editorConfig?.rewindKey || 'ScrollLock'}}</span>/<span class="badge">{{editorConfig?.fastForwardKey || 'Pause'}}</span>
  key will fast forward {{editorConfig?.backtrack || '3'}} seconds.</p>

<h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">Indicating a line is a notable quote</h4>
<p>If a line is particularly noteworthy, you can prefix it with <span class="code">!</span>. E.g.</p>
<pre class="pt-3">!steve: Man alive.</pre>

<h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">Songs</h4>
<p>To indicate a song was played you can use the speaker prefix <span class="code">song:</span> for example
  <span class="code">song: Feeder - Come Back Around</span></p>
<p>The format should be <span class="code">ARTIST - SONG</span></p>

<h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">Summarising multiple-lines</h4>
<p>There is another special <span class="code">#SYN:</span> tag, similar to <span class="code">#OFFSET</span>
  you can use to summarise several lines. For example</p>

<pre class="pt-3">
karl: (twaddle)\n
...\n
#SYN: ricky gets a real bow and arrow!
ricky: Crazy bait blur. All right on Xfm. 104.9 really? Yeah, so I also got a Jane got me a few nice presents including my favorite of all of them a real bow and arrow a real bow and arrow!
steve: Yeah, right and what you, you're going to rob from the rich and give to the poor.
ricky: yeah
...
#/SYN
karl: I used to have a rifle as a kid...
...
</pre>


<h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">Adding Trivia</h4>
<p>Trivia can be added similarly to synopses using <span class="code">#TRIVIA:</span> tags</p>

<pre class="pt-3">
karl: (twaddle)\n
...\n
#TRIVIA: Ricky went on to kill a man with this bow and arrow. He never talks about it.
ricky: Crazy bait blur. All right on Xfm. 104.9 really? Yeah, so I also got a Jane got me a few nice presents including my favorite of all of them a real bow and arrow a real bow and arrow!
steve: Yeah, right and what you, you're going to rob from the rich and give to the poor.
ricky: yeah
...
#/TRIVIA
karl: I used to have a rifle as a kid...
...
</pre>

Trivia may use: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" target="_blank">markdown</a>.

Trivia can also be split across multiple lines by prefixing lines with a # e.g.

<pre class="pt-3">
karl: (twaddle)\n
...\n
#TRIVIA: Ricky went on
# to kill a man with this
# bow and arrow. He never talks about it.
ricky: Crazy bait blur. All right on Xfm. 104.9 really? Yeah, so I also got a Jane got me a few nice presents including my favorite of all of them a real bow and arrow a real bow and arrow!
...
#/TRIVIA
karl: I used to have a rifle as a kid...
...
</pre>

Finally youtube videos can be embedded in a trivia breakout using the same syntax as an image embed e.g.

<pre class="pt-3">
  #TRIVIA: ![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_F0mK4fwb8)
</pre>

<h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">Inserting Offsets</h4>

<p>When viewing an episode the audio timestamps are either "accurate" or "inferred". Inferred offsets are indicated with a darker color and are often inaccurate.</p>
<p>The way they are generated means that small inaccuracies will stack until an accurate offset resets the calculation. As a result the more #OFFSETS that are added
the more accurate the inferred offsets will become, but it is also not strictly necessary to add an offset for every line.</p>

<h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">Gaps</h4>

If there is a gap in the transcript that you wish to make a note of, you can use the <span class="code">#GAP</span> tag.

The format is <span class="code">#GAP: [duration]</span>.

For example if there is5 minutes and 30 seconds of missing transcript you can use the following tag:

<pre class="pt-3">
  #GAP: 5m30s
</pre>

<h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">What will happen next?</h4>
<p>Once a chunk has been submitted it will be reviewed and if it is valid and mostly correct it will be merged
  into
  the raw data file for the episode. This will then become visible in the corresponding episode page after the
  next release. I will attempt to propagate the transcripts back to Pilikipedia.</p>

<h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">Who owns my work?</h4>
<p>Once the content has been merged and becomes available in the github repository I consider it fair game
  for anyone that wishes to copy, modify or share it. I do not claim any kind of ownership over this content
  and am
  providing services to maintain it for my own enjoyment, not as a way to benefit financially or otherwise
  from the content.</p>

<h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">Will I be attributed for my contribution?</h4>
<p>Yes I will try and maintain an accurate list of contributors.</p>

<h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">I have another question or complaint!</h4>
<p>OK open an issue here: <a href="https://github.com/warmans/rsk-search/issues" target="_blank">https://github.com/warmans/rsk-search/issues</a>
